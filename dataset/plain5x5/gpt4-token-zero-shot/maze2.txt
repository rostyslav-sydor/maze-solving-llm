To solve the maze given in the format of an adjacency list, we'll use a standard path finding algorithm, like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well suited for unweighted graphs like this one. Here's the plan:

1. **Parse the input** to extract the adjacency list representation of the maze and identify the origin and target points.
2. **Create a graph representation** with the adjacency list.
3. **Implement BFS** to find the shortest path from origin to target.
4. **Output the path** in the specified format.

### Step 1: Parse the Input
- The origin is `(0,0)` and the target is `(4,4)`.
- The adjacency listings are:
   - `(3,4) <--> (4,4)`
   - `(2,2) <--> (1,2)`
   - and so on...

### Step 2: Build the Graph
Here, we convert the adjacency list into a dictionary-based structure for easy access during BFS:

```python
graph = {
    (3, 4): [(4, 4)],
    (4, 4): [(3, 4), (4, 3)],
    (2, 2): [(1, 2), (2, 1)],
    (1, 2): [(2, 2), (0, 2)],
    (2, 0): [(3, 0), (2, 1)],
    (3, 0): [(3, 1), (2, 0)],
    # More entries...
    (3, 3): [(3, 2)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 2), (0, 0)],
    (0, 0): [(1, 0), (0, 1)],
}
```

### Step 3: BFS Algorithm
Start BFS from origin `(0,0)` and find path to the target `(4,4)`. Store the parent of each node visited to reconstruct the path.

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start, target):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    parent = {start: None}

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node == target:
            break
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Reconstruct path from target to start using parent dictionary
    path = []
    step = target
    while step is not None:
        path.append(step)
        step = parent[step]

    return path[::-1]

path = bfs(graph, (0, 0), (4, 4))
```

### Step 4: Output the Path
Format the path according to the prompt requirements:

```python
print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(f"({x},{y})" for x, y in path), "<PATH_END>")
```

Of course, the `graph` dictionary needs to be created properly by reading and parsing all the input relationships correctly before this code can be executed. Once that dictionary is properly populated as shown in step 2, the rest of the steps can efficiently solve the maze and format the output appropriately.
