**Algorithm**:

1. Start from the starting point and add it to the list of visited nodes.
2. For each unvisited neighbour of the current node, add it to the list of visited nodes and recursively call the algorithm on it.
3. If the current node is the target node, return the list of visited nodes.
4. If none of the neighbours of the current node are unvisited, remove the current node from the list of visited nodes and backtrack to the previous node.

**Solution for the given maze**:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
```
