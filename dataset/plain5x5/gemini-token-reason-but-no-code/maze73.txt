To find a solution for the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Starting from the entry point, we can recursively explore all the adjacent nodes until we reach the exit point.

In this particular maze, we can use the following DFS algorithm:

1. Initialize a stack with the entry point.
2. While the stack is not empty,
3. Pop the top element of the stack.
4. If the popped element is the exit point, then we have found a solution.
5. Otherwise, push all the unvisited adjacent nodes of the popped element onto the stack.

Using this algorithm, we can find the following solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
