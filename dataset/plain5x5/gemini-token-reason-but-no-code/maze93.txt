Let's first define what a maze is: it is a collection of cells, some of which are blocked, and there is a single path from the entry point to the exit point such that only unblocked cells are visited. The maze can be represented as a graph, where each cell is a vertex and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding cells are adjacent and not blocked.

To find a path in a maze, we can use a graph search algorithm, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). However, for this maze we can simply go to the right and then down till we reach the target.

In this specific maze, the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
