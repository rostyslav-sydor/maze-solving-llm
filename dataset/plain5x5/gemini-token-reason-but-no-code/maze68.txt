**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point and find all the adjacent points.
2. For each adjacent point, check if it is the target point.
3. If it is not the target point, add it to a queue and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the queue is empty or the target point is found.
5. If the target point is found, backtrack from the target point to the origin point to obtain the solution path.

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (4,4) (4,3) (4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) <PATH_END>
