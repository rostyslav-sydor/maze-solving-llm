To find the solution to this maze, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at the entry point and explores all possible paths until it finds the exit point.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Start at the entry point.
2. Mark the current point as visited.
3. Explore all unvisited adjacent points.
4. If any of the adjacent points is the exit point, return the path to the exit point.
5. Otherwise, repeat steps 2-4 until the exit point is found.

Using this algorithm, we can find the following solution to the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
