We can represent the maze as a graph, where coordinates are vertices and connections between coordinates are edges.

We can then apply a graph search algorithm like BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point.

In this case, we can use BFS to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (4,4).

The result of the BFS is the following path: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
