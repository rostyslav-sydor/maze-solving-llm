Start at the origin, (0,0) and explore the adjacent vertices.
Go to (1,0) because only (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0).
From (1,0) go to (2,0) because only (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0).
From (2,0) go to (3,0) because only (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0).
From (3,0) go to (4,0) because only (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0).
From (4,0) go to (4,1) because only (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0).
From (4,1) go to (4,2) because only (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1).
From (4,2) go to (4,3) because only (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2).
From (4,3) go to (4,4) because only (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3).
We have reached the target, (4,4).

So the solution is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
