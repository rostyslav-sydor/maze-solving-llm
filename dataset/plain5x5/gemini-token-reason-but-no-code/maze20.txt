In order to find our way through a maze represented as a graph, we first need to find a path from the origin to the target.
For this we can use a variety of graph search algorithms like BFS.
BFS relies on exploring all paths at a particular level before moving on to the next level.
At each step, starting from the origin, we enqueue all neighboring tokens into a queue.
For this maze we start at (0.0), enqueue (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4).
We then proceed to check the neighbors of (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4) and so on and so on.
We do this until we reach the target which is (4.4).
Once we reach the target, we can construct a solution by backtracking the path taken from the target to the origin.
We first start at (4.4) and then check the list of neighbors for any entry that contains (4.4).
In this case, the only entry that contains (4.4) is (3.4).
We proceed to add (3.4) to our solution and move to the next step, which is to check the neighbors for (3.4).
We continue this process until we reach the origin.

For the example maze given, the solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
