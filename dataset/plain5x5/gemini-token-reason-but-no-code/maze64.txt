This graph represents a 5x5 grid.
To solve a maze, one needs to find a path between the entry and exit points.
The entry point is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (4,4).
One can use a breadth-first search algorithm to find a path between the entry and exit points.
The algorithm starts at the entry point and adds all of its neighbors to a queue.
It then removes the first item from the queue and adds all of its neighbors to the queue.
It continues this process until it reaches the exit point.
The path from the entry point to the exit point is the sequence of nodes that were removed from the queue.

In this case, the path from the entry point to the exit point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
