To find a path through a maze like this, a simple, recursive algorithm can be used.
It starts at the origin point and loops through the adjacent points.
If the adjacent point is the target point, the algorithm stops and returns the path.
Otherwise, the algorithm recursively calls itself on the adjacent point, passing in the current path and the adjacent point as parameters.
If the recursive call returns a path, the algorithm returns the path.
Otherwise, the algorithm continues to the next adjacent point.
If the algorithm has looped through all of the adjacent points without finding a path, it returns None.

For the given maze, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
