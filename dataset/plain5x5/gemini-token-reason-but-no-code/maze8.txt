This maze can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS).
DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at the entry point and explores all possible paths until it finds the exit point.
If a path leads to a dead end, the algorithm backtracks and explores a different path.

For this maze, the DFS algorithm would start at (0,0) and explore the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
