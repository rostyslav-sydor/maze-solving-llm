To find a solution for a given maze, we need to find a path from the start position to the end position that satisfies the requirements of the maze.

For the maze represented above, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to try all possible paths until we find a solution.
DFS algorithm starts from the start node and explores all possible paths until it reaches the target node.

Following the algorithm:

 - start at (0,0),
 - move right to (1,0),
 - move down to (1,1),
 - move right to (1,2),
 - move right to (1,3),
 - move down to (1,4),
 - move right to (2,4),
 - move up to (2,3),
 - move left to (2,2),
 - move up to (2,1),
 - move left to (2,0),
 - move up to (1,0),
 - move left to (0,0)

This path does not lead to the target node, so the algorithm continues by choosing the next possible path from the starting node:

 - start at (0,0),
 - move right to (1,0),
 - move down to (1,1),
 - move right to (1,2),
 - move right to (1,3),
 - move down to (1,4),
 - move right to (2,4),
 - move down to (3,4),
 - move right to (4,4)

This path leads to the target node, so it is the solution to the maze.

Solution in required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
