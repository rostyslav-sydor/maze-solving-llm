This specific maze can be solved by applying Depth First Search (DFS) graph traversal algorithm.

Starting from the entry point (0, 0), we explore all possible paths by following the edges of the graph. If an edge leads to a dead end (a node with no outgoing edges), we backtrack to the last node with unexplored edges.

The DFS traversal would be as follows:
(0, 0) --> (1, 0) --> (2, 0) --> (3, 0) --> (4, 0) --> (4, 1) --> (4, 2) --> (4, 3) --> (4, 4)

Therefore, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 4) <PATH_END>
