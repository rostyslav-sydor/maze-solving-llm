The algorithm chosen for solving mazes is the depth-first search with backtracking. It is simple, easy to implement, and works well for small and medium-sized mazes like the provided one.

Depth-first search starts from the starting point and explores all possible paths to the exit. If a path reaches a dead end, the algorithm backtracks to the last visited node and explores a different path. This process continues until the exit is found or all possible paths have been exhausted.

In case of the provided maze, the algorithm will start from the origin at coordinate (0,0) and explore the available paths: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0). At this point, the algorithm will backtrack to (0,1) and explore the path (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). Since this path leads to the exit, the algorithm will stop.

The solution to the provided maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
