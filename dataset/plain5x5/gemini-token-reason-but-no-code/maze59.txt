To find a solution to a maze represented as a graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. 

DFS involves recursively exploring each possible path until a solution is found. 

BFS involves exploring all of the paths of a given length before moving to paths of the next length.

For the given maze, we can start from the origin and explore all possible paths until we reach the target.

Starting from (0,0) and exploring all paths of length 1, we can reach (0,1), (1,0), and (2,0). 

Continuing to explore paths of length 2, we can reach (1,1), (2,1), and (0,2). 

Eventually, we will reach the target (4,4) by exploring paths of length 5. 

Thus, the solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
