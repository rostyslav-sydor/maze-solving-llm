The maze can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms.
DFS keeps track of the current path and backtracks if it hits a dead end.
BFS explores all the possible paths at each level before moving to the next level.

In this case, we will use DFS to find a solution to the maze.
Starting from the starting point (0,0), we will explore all the possible paths until we reach the target point (4,4).
If we hit a dead end, we will backtrack and explore a different path.

Here is the solution to the maze in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
