To find a solution for the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

DFS starts at the origin and explores all possible paths until it finds a path to the target. If no path is found, DFS backtracks and explores a different path. 

To implement DFS, we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes that have been visited. 

At each step, we explore the unvisited neighbors of the current node. If a neighbor is the target, we have found a path and can stop the search. Otherwise, we add the neighbor to the stack and continue the search. 

If we reach a dead end (i.e., a node with no unvisited neighbors), we pop the node from the stack and continue the search from the next node on the stack. 

For the given maze, the solution found by DFS is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
