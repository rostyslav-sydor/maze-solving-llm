**Reasoning:**
This is a classic graph problem. The graph can be represented as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. In this case, an adjacency list is provided. The problem can be solved using a depth first search (DFS) or breadth first search (BFS). In this case, we will use DFS.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start from the origin token and push it onto the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
    * Pop the top token from the stack and mark it as visited.
    * If the token is the target token, then the solution has been found. Output the list of tokens from the origin token to the target token.
    * Otherwise, for each token that is adjacent to the current token and has not been visited, push it onto the stack.
3. If the stack is empty, then the solution has not been found.

**Specific solution:**

Applying the algorithm to the given maze, we get the following solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
