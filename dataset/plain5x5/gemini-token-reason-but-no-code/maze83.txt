The maze can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS), which starts at the entry point and explores all possible paths until it finds the exit point.

In DFS, we maintain a stack of visited nodes and explore the maze by moving from the current node to one of its unvisited neighbors.

If the current node has no unvisited neighbors, we backtrack to the previous node in the stack and continue the exploration.

We repeat this process until we reach the exit point.

For the given maze, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
