We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a solution for this maze. DFS algorithm starts from the entry point and explore all possible paths until it finds the exit point.

Here is how DFS algorithm works:

1. Start from the entry point.
2. Mark the entry point as visited.
3. Explore all unvisited neighbors of the current point.
4. If any of the neighbors is the exit point, return the path from the entry point to the exit point.
5. If none of the neighbors is the exit point, backtrack to the previous point and continue exploring from there.

Applying DFS algorithm to the given maze, we can find the following solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
