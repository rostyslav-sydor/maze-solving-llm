A possible solution to the maze can be found by using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starting from the <ORIGIN_START> token and ending at the <TARGET_END> token.
DFS algorithm works by traversing the graph from the starting node, and then recursively traversing all of its neighbors.
If any of the neighbor is the target node, then the DFS algorithm has found a solution.
If not, then the DFS algorithm will backtrack and try a different neighbor.
This process will repeat until either the target node is found or there are no more neighbors to explore.

For the given maze, the DFS algorithm would start at the <ORIGIN_START> token and traverse the graph in the following order:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
