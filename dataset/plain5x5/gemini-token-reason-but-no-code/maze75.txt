**Reasoning:**

To solve a maze, one can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. Both algorithms involve iteratively exploring paths from a starting point, marking visited nodes, and searching for a path to the end point.

**BFS:**
BFS explores all possibilities at each level before moving on to the next level.
1. Initialize a queue with the starting point.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue the first point from the queue.
    - Mark the point as visited.
    - If the point is the end point, return the path.
    - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the point.

**DFS:**
DFS explores one path as far as possible before backtracking.
1. Initialize a stack with the starting point.
2. While the stack is not empty:
    - Pop the first point from the stack.
    - Mark the point as visited.
    - If the point is the end point, return the path.
    - Otherwise, push all unvisited neighbors of the point onto the stack.

**Solution for the given maze:**

Using the BFS algorithm, we can find the path as follows:

1. Initialize the queue with (0,0).
2. Dequeue (0,0) and mark it as visited.
3. Enqueue (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).
4. Dequeue (1,0) and mark it as visited.
5. Enqueue (2,0).
6. Dequeue (0,1) and mark it as visited.
7. Enqueue (1,1).
8. Dequeue (1,1) and mark it as visited.
9. Enqueue (2,1).
10. Dequeue (2,0) and mark it as visited.
11. Enqueue (3,0).
12. Dequeue (2,1) and mark it as visited.
13. Enqueue (3,1) and (1,2).
14. Dequeue (3,0) and mark it as visited.
15. Enqueue (4,0).
16. Dequeue (3,1) and mark it as visited.
17. Enqueue (4,1).
18. Dequeue (1,2) and mark it as visited.
19. Enqueue (2,2).
20. Dequeue (4,0) and mark it as visited.
21. Enqueue (3,3).
22. Dequeue (4,1) and mark it as visited.
23. Enqueue (3,2).
24. Dequeue (3,3) and mark it as visited.
25. Enqueue (4,4).
26. Dequeue (3,2) and mark it as visited.
27. Enqueue (2,2).
28. Dequeue (2,2) and mark it as visited.
29. Enqueue (2,3).
30. Dequeue (2,3) and mark it as visited.
31. Enqueue (3,3).
32. Dequeue (3,3) and mark it as visited.
33. Enqueue (4,4).
34. Dequeue (4,4) and mark it as visited.

Therefore, the path from (0,0) to (4,4) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
