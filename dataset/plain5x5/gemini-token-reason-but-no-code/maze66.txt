A maze is represented as a graph, and as such a graph traversal algorithm can be used to find the path through the maze.

Since the maze does not have weights associated with the edges, the simplest algorithm is a breadth-first search.

Breadth-first search starts at the starting node and explores all of its neighbors.
It then explores all of the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on.
This ensures that the algorithm finds the shortest path to the target node.

In the given maze, starting form (0,0), it would first explore its neighbors (0,1), (1,0), and (2,0), then their neighbors, and so on.
It would eventually reach the target node (4,4), and the path would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
