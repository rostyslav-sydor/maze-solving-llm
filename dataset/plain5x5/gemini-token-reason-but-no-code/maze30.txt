The maze can be solved using a breadth first search algorithm.
The algorithm starts at the entry point and explores all of the nodes that are adjacent to it.
It then explores all of the nodes that are adjacent to those nodes, and so on.
The algorithm stops when it reaches the exit point.

The following is a solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
