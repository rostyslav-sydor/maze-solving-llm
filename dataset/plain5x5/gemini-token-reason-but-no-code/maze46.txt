A way to find the solution is to do BFS starting from one of the origin points, and keep track of parent for each discovered node.
When you get to the target point, you can backtrack from it to the origin point to get the full path.
For this example maze, with starting point at `(0, 0)` and ending at `(4,4)`, the solution is:

<PATH_START> 
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(0, 3)
(1, 3)
(2, 3)
(3, 3)
(3, 4)
(4, 4)
<PATH_END>
