The maze can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
DFS would start at the start and recursively visit each node until it reaches the destination or exhausts all possibilities, while BFS would start at the start and visit each node level by level until it reaches the destination.

For this particular maze, using DFS would result in the following solution:<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
