**Reasoning:**

The maze is represented as a graph with vertices at each cell and edges between adjacent cells. The goal of the algorithm is to find a path from the origin vertex to the target vertex.

One approach to finding a path in a graph is to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS works by recursively searching all possible paths from a given vertex until a path to the target vertex is found.

To adapt the DFS algorithm to this problem, we can start the search at the origin vertex and recursively visit all adjacent vertices until we reach the target vertex. If a vertex has already been visited, we can skip it to avoid cycles in the path.

**Specific Solution:**

Applying the DFS algorithm to the given maze, we get the following path from the origin vertex (0,0) to the target vertex (4,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
