To solve this maze we will use Depth-First search algorithm.

We start from the starting position and explore all possible paths until we reach the end position.

If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and explore another path.

For the given maze, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
