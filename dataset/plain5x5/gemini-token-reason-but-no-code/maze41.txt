To solve a maze represented as a graph, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS starts at the entry point and explores all of its adjacent nodes, then explores all of the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on. This process continues until the exit point is reached.

In the given maze, we can start at the entry point (0,0) and explore its adjacent nodes, which are (1,0), (0,1), and (3,0). We can then explore the adjacent nodes of these nodes, and so on, until we reach the exit point (4,4).

The path from the entry point to the exit point is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
