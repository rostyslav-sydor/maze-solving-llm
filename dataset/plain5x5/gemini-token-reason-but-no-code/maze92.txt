**Reasoning:**

To find a solution to the maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS starts at the origin and explores all possible paths one step at a time, keeping track of the path taken so far. When the target is reached, the path taken can be traced back to find the solution.

**Specific solution for the provided maze:**
