To find a solution for this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. 

Starting from the origin (0,0), we will explore all possible paths recursively, marking each visited cell as we go along. 

If we reach the target cell (4,4), we have found a solution and can stop searching. 

Otherwise, we will backtrack to the last cell we visited and continue exploring from there. 

Here is one possible solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
