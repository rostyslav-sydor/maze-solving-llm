In order to find the shortest path through a maze, the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm can be applied to find a minimal solution in terms of traversal operations (time) and number of visited nodes (space). The algorithm operates on the principle of exploring all possible paths of the graph from the origin node, before continuing to the next level. Specifically for mazes, BFS will explore horizontally before going deeper.

In our case, we start from (0,0) marked as <ORIGIN_START> and proceed as follows:

* Level 1: only (0,0) is available.

* Level 2: only (0,1), (1,0) adjacent to (0,0) can be reached, with (0,1) leading to the direction of (4,4), the <TARGET_END>, while (1,0) is a dead end. 

* Level 3: only (0,2) is reachable. (0,1) having no adjacent node has no further options, (1,0) is a dead end.

* Level 4: (1,1) and (2,2) now reachable from (0,1), (0,2). (0,2) being a dead end, (1,1) is pursued further. (1,2), (1,1) and (1,3) reachable from (1,1) . 

* Level 5: (2,3) reachable from (1,3) leads to (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4), the final <TARGET_END> node of our maze and terminates the algorithm.

The solution path in the required format is:  
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
```
