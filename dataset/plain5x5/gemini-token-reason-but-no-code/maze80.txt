Starting at the origin, we can see that there are two possible paths to take: (1,0) or (2,0). We can rule out (2,0) because it would lead us into a dead end. So, we take (1,0) and follow the path (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
