## Reasoning for Depth First Search (DFS)

We can use Depth First Search (DFS) to find a path from the starting point to the ending point of the maze.

DFS works by recursively exploring all possible paths from the current location until it reaches the ending point or until there are no more paths to explore.

DFS is a good choice for solving mazes because it is simple to implement and it can be used to find the shortest path between two points.

## DFS Implementation

Here is a simple DFS implementation in Python:

```python
def dfs(graph, start, end):
  """
  Performs a Depth First Search on a graph from a starting point to an ending point.

  Args:
    graph: A dictionary representing the graph.
    start: The starting point.
    end: The ending point.

  Returns:
    A list of coordinates representing the path from the starting point to the ending point.
  """

  # If the starting point is the ending point, then we have found a path.
  if start == end:
    return [start]

  # Get the list of neighbors of the starting point.
  neighbors = graph[start]

  # For each neighbor, recursively call dfs.
  for neighbor in neighbors:
    path = dfs(graph, neighbor, end)

    # If path is not None, then we have found a path.
    if path is not None:
      return [start] + path

  # If no path was found, then return None.
  return None
```

## Solution for the Given Maze

The following is a solution for the given maze using the DFS implementation:

```python
graph = {
  (0, 0): [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)],
  (0, 1): [(0, 0), (0, 2)],
  (0, 2): [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3)],
  (0, 3): [(0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4)],
  (0, 4): [(0, 3)],
  (1, 0): [(1, 1)],
  (1, 1): [(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)],
  (1, 2): [(1, 1), (1, 3)],
  (1, 3): [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4)],
  (1, 4): [(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4)],
  (2, 0): [(2, 1), (3, 0)],
  (2, 1): [(2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3)],
  (2, 2): [(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)],
  (2, 3): [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)],
  (2, 4): [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4)],
  (3, 0): [(2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)],
  (3, 1): [(3, 0), (3, 2)],
  (3, 2): [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3)],
  (3, 3): [(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)],
  (3, 4): [(3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 4)],
  (4, 0): [(4, 1), (3, 0)],
  (4, 1): [(4, 0), (4, 2)],
  (4, 2): [(4, 1), (4, 3)],
  (4, 3): [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)],
  (4, 4): [(4, 3), (3, 4)]
}

start = (0, 0)
end = (4, 4)

path = dfs(graph, start, end)

print(path)
```

Output:

```
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
```
