**Solution Outline**

The task is to find a path from the starting point to the target point in the given maze.
For this task Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is a simple and efficient approach.
Starting from the starting point, it constructs the shortest path from the starting point by iteratively exploring the neighbor nodes of already visited and explored nodes until the destination node is found.
At each step, the algorithm enqueues all the neighbors of the current node into a queue and then dequeues the next node to explore from the queue.

**Solution for provided maze:**

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 4) <PATH_END>
