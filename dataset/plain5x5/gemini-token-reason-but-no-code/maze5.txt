We can apply Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the entry point to the exit point in a maze represented as a adjacency list graph.

The basic idea of DFS is to start from the entry point, and explore all the possible paths recursively until the exit point is found.
If a path does not lead to the exit point, then backtrack and explore another path.

In this maze, we can start from the entry point (0,0) and explore the following paths:

- (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) (exit point)
- (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) (exit point)

The first path is the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point.

Therefore, the solution to this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
