To find a solution for the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). 

These algorithms work by starting at the origin (marked with <ORIGIN_START>) and recursively exploring the maze until the target (marked with <TARGET_END>) is reached. 

As we explore the maze, we should keep track of the path taken as a list of coordinates. 

When we reach the target, we can output the path taken as a list of coordinates by traversing the list of coordinates collected so far. 

For the given maze, a possible solution is:

<PATH_START>
(0,0)
(0,1)
(1,1)
(1,2)
(1,3)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(4,3)
(4,4)
<PATH_END>
