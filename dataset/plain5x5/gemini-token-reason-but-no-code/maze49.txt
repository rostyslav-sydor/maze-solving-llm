Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to solve a maze. 

Start from the entry point and recursively explore all possible paths until the exit point is reached. 

If a dead end is reached, backtrack to the last junction and explore a different path. 

For the given maze, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
