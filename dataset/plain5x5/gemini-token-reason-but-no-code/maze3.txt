**Reasoning:** 

The maze can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. 
Starting from the entry point, one can follow any path until a dead end is reached. 
If a dead end is reached, one can backtrack to the last intersection and try a different path. 
This process is repeated until the exit point is reached. 
DFS is used because it is a simple and efficient algorithm for solving mazes.

**Solution:** 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
