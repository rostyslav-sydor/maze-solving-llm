This maze can be solved using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths from the starting point until it finds a solution or exhausts all possibilities.

At each step, the algorithm chooses an unexplored path and follows it until it reaches either the goal or a dead end. If it reaches a dead end, it backtracks to the last unexplored path and continues the search from there.

In this case, the algorithm starts at the origin (0,0) and explores the path (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4). This path leads to the goal, so the algorithm terminates and returns the solution.

The solution to this maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
