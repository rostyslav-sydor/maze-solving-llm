To find a path in a maze, a search algorithm can be used.
For example, a DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm can be used to traverse the maze and find a path from the entry point to the exit point.
The DFS algorithm starts at the entry point and recursively explores all possible paths until it finds an exit point.
If the algorithm reaches a dead end, it backtracks and explores another path.
In this specific maze, the DFS algorithm would start at (0,0) and explore the following path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4).
Therefore, the solution to this maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
