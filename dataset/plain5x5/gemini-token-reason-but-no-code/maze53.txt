To find the solution for the maze represented as an adjacency list, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm can be used.
Starting from the origin point, the algorithm explores all the adjacent nodes level by level, until the target point is reached.
In this case, the origin point is (0,0) and the target point is (4,4).
The algorithm starts by exploring the adjacent nodes of (0,0), which are (1,0) and (0,1).
It then explores the adjacent nodes of (1,0) and (0,1), and so on.
The algorithm keeps track of the nodes that have been visited, and the path taken to reach each node.
Once the target point is reached, the algorithm backtracks to find the shortest path from the origin point to the target point.
In this case, the shortest path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
