Depth-First Search (DFS) is a popular graph traversal algorithm which is applicable to mazes as well. In DFS, we pick a starting point and follow a path until we reach a dead end and then backtrack and try another path. This process is repeated until we find a path to the exit or we have tried all possible paths.

We can use DFS to solve the given maze. We start at the entry point and follow the path that leads to the exit. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try another path. We continue this process until we find a path to the exit.

The following is a solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
