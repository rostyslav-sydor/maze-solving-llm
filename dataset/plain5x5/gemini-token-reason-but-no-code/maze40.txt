The maze can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The algorithm starts at the origin point and explores all possible paths until it finds the target point or there are no more paths to explore. The algorithm keeps a stack of visited points, and for each point, it explores all its adjacent points that have not been visited yet. If the target point is found, the algorithm returns the path from the origin to the target point.

The following is a solution for the given maze using DFS algorithm:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,2) (4,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
