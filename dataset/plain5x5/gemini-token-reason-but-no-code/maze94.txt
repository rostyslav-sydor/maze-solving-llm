**Reasoning** 

To solve the maze, we start from the origin and explore all the possible paths until we reach the target.
We can represent maze exploration as a depth-first search on graph where nodes are cells and edges between adjacent cells.
To find a solution we can either implement recursive depth-first search, or implement it iteratively using stack to store nodes to be explored in the next step.

**Solution** 

We start at cell (0,0) which is marked as the entry point with <ORIGIN_START> token. 
We can move either to (0,1) or (0,2) cells from this entry point.
We choose to move to (0,2).
Now from (0,2) we could choose to move to either (1,2) or (0,3).
We choose to move to (0,3) which leads to (1,3).
Next we move to (2,3) and then to (2,4).
From here there is only one option to reach the exit point at (4,4).
So the path between entry and exit points is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
