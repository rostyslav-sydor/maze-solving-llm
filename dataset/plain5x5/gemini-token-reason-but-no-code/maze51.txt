To solve a maze using Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithm, we need to start from the entry point and recursively explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point.
At each step, we mark the current position as visited and add it to the path.
If the current position is the exit point, we have found a solution and can return the path.
Otherwise, we explore all unvisited neighbors of the current position and recursively call the DFS algorithm on each neighbor.
If none of the neighbors lead to a solution, we backtrack and remove the current position from the path.

Applying this algorithm to the given maze, we start from the entry point (0,0) and explore all possible paths.
The first path we explore is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4), which is the exit point.
Therefore, the solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
