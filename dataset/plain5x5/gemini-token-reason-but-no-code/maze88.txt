**Reasoning:**

The maze can be represented as a graph where each node is a cell and each edge is a connection between two adjacent cells. The start and end points are two special nodes. The goal is to find a path from the start node to the end node.

Depth-first search (DFS) is suitable for solving mazes because it systematically explores all possible paths until a solution is found or all paths have been exhausted. DFS always explores the current path as far as possible before backtracking to explore other paths.

**Solution for the specific maze:**

Starting at the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0), follow below path to reach the target <TARGET_END> (4,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
