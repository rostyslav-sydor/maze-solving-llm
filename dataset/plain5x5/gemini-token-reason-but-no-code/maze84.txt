To solve a maze using an adjacency list representation, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. 

BFS works by starting at the origin node and exploring all of its adjacent nodes. 
It then explores all of the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on. 
As it explores each node, it marks it as visited so that it doesn't explore it again. 
Once it has explored all of the adjacent nodes of a node, it moves on to the next unvisited node in the queue. 

If the BFS algorithm reaches the target node, then it has found a solution to the maze. 
The solution can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target node to the origin node, following the visited nodes. 

For the given maze, the BFS algorithm would start at the origin node (0,0) and explore its adjacent nodes, which are (0,1), (1,0), and (2,0). 
It would then explore the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on. 
Eventually, it would reach the target node (4,4), and it would reconstruct the solution by backtracking from (4,4) to (0,0). 

The solution to the given maze is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
