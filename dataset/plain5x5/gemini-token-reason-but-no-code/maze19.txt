The maze is solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
Starting from the start position in the graph we explore all of its neighbours and repeat this process until we arrive at the exit point.
This will provide us with the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
