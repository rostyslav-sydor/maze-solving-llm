This maze can be solved by using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

DFS is an algorithm that starts at the origin node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

For each node, we can explore its adjacent nodes. If the adjacent node is the target node, then we have found a solution. Otherwise, we can mark the adjacent node as visited and continue to explore its adjacent nodes.

For the given maze, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
