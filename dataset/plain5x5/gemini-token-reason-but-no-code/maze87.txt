To find a solution to the maze, a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to explore the graph starting from the entry point and ending at the exit point. 

In this case, let's start with a DFS and explore the maze. 

Starting at the entry point (0, 0), we can explore the paths (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1). 

Let's start with (0, 1). We can then explore the paths (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), and (1, 2). Let's continue with (0, 2). 

We can explore the paths (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2). Let's explore (1, 2). We can explore the path (1, 3). Let's explore that path. We can explore the path (1, 4). 

Let's continue with that path. We can explore (2, 4). We can explore the path (3, 4). We can explore the path (4, 4). This is the exit point. 

We have found a solution: <PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 4) <PATH_END>
