The maze is represented as a graph, where each node is a cell in the maze and each edge is a connection between two cells. The entry and exit points are marked as special nodes.

To find a solution to the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). These algorithms systematically explore all possible paths from the entry point to the exit point, until a solution is found.

For example, using DFS to find a solution for the given maze.

Start at (0,0)
Visit (1,0) and since it's a dead end (no adjacent unvisited cells), backtrack to (0,0)
Visit (0,1)
Visit (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Visit (2,3) and since it's a dead end, backtrack to (1,3)
Visit (0,3)
Visit (1,4), (2,4), and since it's a dead end backtrack to (1,4)
Visit (3,4) and since it's a dead end, backtrack to (0,3)
Visit (0,4) and since it's a dead end, backtrack to (0,3)
Visit (0,2)
Visit (0,3) and since we've already been here, we backtrack to (0,2)
Visit (2,2)
Visit (1,2), and since we've already visited it, backtrack to (2,2)
Visit(2,0)
Visit(3,0)
Visit(4,0), we're at the exit.

So the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (2,2) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) <PATH_END>
