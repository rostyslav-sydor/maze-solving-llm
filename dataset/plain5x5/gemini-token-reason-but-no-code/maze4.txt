The provided adjacency list represents a graph. To find a solution to the maze, we can apply a graph search algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

We start by selecting the origin as our starting point and adding it to a queue. We then iteratively remove nodes from the queue, mark them as visited, and add their unvisited neighbors to the queue. We continue this process until we reach the target.

The solution to the provided maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
