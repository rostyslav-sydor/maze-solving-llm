To find a solution for a maze, one can use a variety of algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), or A*.

For this maze, we can use DFS to find a path from the starting point to the ending point. Starting from the starting point, we can explore all possible paths until we reach the ending point. If we reach a dead end, we can backtrack to the previous point and explore a different path.

Here is one possible solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
