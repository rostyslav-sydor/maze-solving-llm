In this example, we start at (0,0) and need to get to (4,4). We can start by going to (0,1), but from there we can't go anywhere. So, we can try going to (0,2), and from there we can go to (1,2) and then to (1,3). From (1,3), we can go to (1,4) and then to (2,4). From (2,4), we can go to (3,4) and then to (4,4). So, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
