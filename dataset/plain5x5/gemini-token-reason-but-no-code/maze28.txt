To solve a maze represented as a graph, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

**Reasoning:**

BFS and DFS are both graph traversal algorithms that can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. BFS explores all the nodes at a given level before moving on to the next level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In the case of a maze, we can use either BFS or DFS to find the shortest path between the starting and ending points.

**Solution:**

Using a BFS algorithm, we can find the solution to the given maze as follows:

1. Start at the starting point (0,0).
2. Add the starting point to a queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    1. Remove the first item from the queue.
    2. If the item is the ending point (4,4), then we have found the solution.
    3. Otherwise, add all of the item's adjacent nodes to the queue.
4. Repeat step 3 until the queue is empty or the ending point is found.

The following is the solution to the given maze in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
