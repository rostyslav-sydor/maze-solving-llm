To solve a maze represented as a graph, we should use a graph traversal algorithm. 

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is an algorithm that traverses a graph level by level, starting from the origin node, and exploring all the neighbors of the current node before moving to the next level.  
**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is an algorithm that traverses a graph by following a single path until it reaches a dead end, and then backtracking to explore other paths.

For mazes, BFS is generally preferred over DFS because it guarantees to find the shortest path between the origin and target nodes. DFS may get stuck in loops or explore unnecessary paths, leading to a longer or even no solution.

In this specific maze, we can apply BFS starting from the origin node (0,0). We can add the origin node to a queue and mark it as visited. Then, we can loop through the queue and check if the current node is the target node (4,4). If it is, we have found a solution, and we can backtrack to output the path. If it is not, we can add all the unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue and mark them as visited. We can repeat this process until the queue is empty or we find a solution.

Following the BFS algorithm, we can find the solution path as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
