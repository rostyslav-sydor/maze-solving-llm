<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) we take the right branch to (0,1).
From there we take the only branch possible to (1,1).
From (1,1) we take the only branch possible to (1,2).
From (1,2) we take the only branch possible to (1,3).
From (1,3) we take the only branch possible to (1,4).
From (1,4) we take the only branch possible to (2,4).
From (2,4) we take the only branch possible to (3,4).
Finally we take the only branch possible from (3,4) to the target <TARGET_END> (4,4).

**Checking if the solution does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells:**

We can check this by iterating over the list of coordinates in the solution. For each coordinate, we can check if it is adjacent to the previous coordinate in the list. If it is not adjacent, then the solution crosses a wall. Additionally, we can check if the coordinate is not in the list of walls. If it is in the list of walls, then the solution crosses a wall.

In this case, we can see that each coordinate in the solution is adjacent to the previous coordinate, and none of the coordinates are in the list of walls. Therefore, the solution does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
