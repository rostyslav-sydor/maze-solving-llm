<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path follows the edge of the maze, starting from the origin at (0,0) and moving clockwise around the perimeter. It uses only adjacent cells and does not cross any walls.

To check if the path does not cross any walls, we can check that each step in the path is either to an adjacent cell in the same row or column, or to a cell that is one row and one column away from the current cell. For example, the step from (0,0) to (0,1) is an adjacent cell in the same column, and the step from (1,3) to (1,4) is an adjacent cell in the same row. The step from (2,4) to (3,4) is one row and one column away from the current cell.

To check if the path uses only adjacent cells, we can check that each step in the path is either to an adjacent cell in the same row or column, or to a cell that is one row and one column away from the current cell. For example, the step from (0,0) to (0,1) is an adjacent cell in the same column, and the step from (1,3) to (1,4) is an adjacent cell in the same row. The step from (2,4) to (3,4) is not an adjacent cell, but it is one row and one column away from the current cell and is therefore still valid.
