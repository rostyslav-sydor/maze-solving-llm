<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

The solution is found by starting from the <ORIGIN_START> token and following the path through the adjacency list until the <TARGET_END> token is reached. The path must always follow the arrows in the adjacency list, and it must not cross any walls (represented by `;` in the adjacency list).

To check if the solution is valid, we can reconstruct the path by starting from the <ORIGIN_START> token and following the arrows in the adjacency list. If the path reaches the <TARGET_END> token without crossing any walls, then the solution is valid.

In this case, the solution is valid because the path follows the arrows in the adjacency list and it does not cross any walls.
