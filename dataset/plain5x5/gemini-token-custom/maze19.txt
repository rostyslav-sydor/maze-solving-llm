Possible path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
2. Move down to (1,1) and then right to (2,1).
3. Move up to (2,0) and then right to (3,0).
4. Move down to (3,1) and then right to (4,1).
5. Move down to (4,2) and then right to (4,3).
6. Finally, move up to (4,4).

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
