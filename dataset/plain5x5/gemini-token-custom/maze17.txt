<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path begins at the start square `(0, 0)` and moves toward the exit point at the bottom-right corner of the maze.

Initially, the path can only move one square to the right to occupy the coordinate `(0,1)`. The path could also initially move down at the first step but due to the fact that the exit is on the right from the entrance we move right first. 

From  `(0,1)` the path can move either down to get to `(1,1)` or continue traveling right to get to `(0,2)`. We proceed towards the down direction as that gets us closer to the exit.

Following this logic as well as avoiding dead ends, the path eventually reaches the exit point through adjacent cells and without hitting any walls.
