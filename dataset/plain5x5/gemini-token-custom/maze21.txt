A possible solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1), then up to (1,1).
From there, we move right to (2,1), then up to (2,2).
Next, we move right to (2,3), then up to (3,3).
Finally, we move right to (4,3) and then up to the target (4,4).

This path does not cross any walls and each step is between adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution.
