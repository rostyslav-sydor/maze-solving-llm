<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning

- Start at the entry point (0,0) and find a path to the exit point (4,4).
- Move right to (1,0) there is no adjacency to north.
- Move right to (2,0) there is no adjacency to north.
- Move right to (3,0) there is no adjacency to north.
- Move right to (4,0) there is adjacency to north.
- Move north to (4,1) there is adjacency to east.
- Move east to (4,2) there is adjacency to east.
- Move east to (4,3) there is adjacency to east.
- Move east to (4,4) which is exit point.

### Verification

- There are no adjacency between (0,0) and (1,0).
- There are no adjacency between (1,0) and (2,0).
- There are no adjacency between (2,0) and (3,0).
- There are no adjacency between (3,0) and (4,0).
- There are no adjacency between (4,0) and (4,1).
- There are no adjacency between (4,1) and (4,2).
- There are no adjacency between (4,2) and (4,3).
- There are no adjacency between (4,3) and (4,4).
