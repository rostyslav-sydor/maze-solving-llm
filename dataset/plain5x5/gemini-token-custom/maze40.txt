To find a solution for this maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting point to the ending point.

Here's how the DFS algorithm would work in this case:

Starting at the starting point (0,0), we can explore the adjacent cells: (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0) (since it is the origin and it can be visited multiple times).
From (1,0), we can explore (2,0), (1,1), and (0,0).
From (2,0), we can explore (2,1), (3,0), and (1,0).
From (2,1), we can explore (2,2), (1,1), and (2,0).
From (1,1), we can explore (1,2), (0,1), and (2,1).
From (1,2), we can explore (1,3), (2,2), and (0,2).
From (2,2), we can explore (2,3), (3,2), and (1,2).
From (1,3), we can explore (1,4), (0,3), and (2,3).
From (1,4), we can explore (2,4), (0,4), and (1,3).
From (2,4), we can explore (3,4) and (2,3).
From (3,4), we have reached the ending point (4,4).
So the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

We can check if the solution path does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells by examining the adjacency list. Each vertex in the adjacency list represents a cell in the maze, and the list of vertices adjacent to that vertex represents the cells that can be directly moved from that cell. By checking that each pair of adjacent cells in the solution path is included in the adjacency list, we can verify that the solution path does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
