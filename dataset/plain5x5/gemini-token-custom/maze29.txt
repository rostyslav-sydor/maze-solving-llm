Let's start from the starting point and explore the maze.

From (0,0) we can go to (0,1) or (1,0). Let's try (0,1).

From (0,1) we can go to (0,0) or (0,2). Let's try (0,2).

From (0,2) we can go to (0,1) or (0,3). Let's try (0,3).

From (0,3) we can go to (0,2) or (0,4). Let's try (0,4).

From (0,4) we can go to (0,3) or (1,4). Let's try (1,4).

From (1,4) we can go to (0,4) or (1,3). Let's try (1,3).

From (1,3) we can go to (1,4) or (1,2). Let's try (1,2).

From (1,2) we can go to (1,3) or (1,1). Let's try (1,1).

From (1,1) we can go to (1,2) or (1,0). Let's try (1,0).

From (1,0) we can go to (1,1) or (2,0). Let's try (2,0).

From (2,0) we can go to (1,0) or (2,1). Let's try (2,1).

From (2,1) we can go to (2,0) or (3,1). Let's try (3,1).

From (3,1) we can go to (2,1) or (3,2). Let's try (3,2).

From (3,2) we can go to (3,1) or (3,3). Let's try (3,3).

From (3,3) we can go to (3,2) or (4,3). Let's try (4,3).

From (4,3) we can go to (3,3) or (4,4). Let's try (4,4).

We have reached the target point (4,4).

The path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

We can check if the path is valid by ensuring that each step is adjacent to the previous step and that we never cross any walls.

The path is valid, so it is a solution to the maze.
