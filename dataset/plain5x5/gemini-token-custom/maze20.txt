<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

- To begin with, start at the origin coordinate and follow the graph until the target coordinate is reached while ensuring there are no loops formed
- In this case, starting at (0,0), it is possible to go either (0,1) or (1,0), it does not matter which one since we will be able to move to the other one from either path and eventually to the target by taking proper right-hand rule turns
- Taking the (0,1) path, next turn goes to (0,2) followed by (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and finally (4,3) and (4,4) which is the target
- The generated path does not contain loops which makes it valid, all moves were to adjacent cells which were connected via an edge, and no walls were crossed
