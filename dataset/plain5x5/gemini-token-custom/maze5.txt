<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
2. Continue moving right to (2,0).
3. Move down to (3,0).
4. Move right to (4,0).
5. Move up to (4,1).
6. Move right to (4,2).
7. Move up to (4,3).
8. Move right to (4,4), the target point.

**Check:**

1. No walls are crossed because the path follows the adjacency list, which specifies which cells are connected.
2. The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is either to the right, up, or down, and each move is to a cell that is adjacent to the previous cell.
