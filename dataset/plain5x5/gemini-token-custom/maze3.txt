<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,3) (4,3) (4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,4) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

* Start at the origin (0,0).
* Move right to (0,1).
* Move right again to (0,2).
* Move up to (1,2).
* Move right again to (1,3).
* Move up to (1,4).
* Move right to (2,4).
* Move down to (3,4).
* Move left to (3,3).
* Move down to (4,3).
* Move left to (4,2).
* Move up to (3,2).
* Move left to (2,2).
* Move down to (2,1).
* Move left to (3,1).
* Move down to (3,0).
* Move left to (4,0).
* Move up to (4,1).
* Move left to (4,4).

**Checking the solution:**

* The path does not cross any walls, as each move is to an adjacent cell.
* The path uses only adjacent cells, as each move is to a cell that is either horizontally or vertically adjacent to the previous cell.
