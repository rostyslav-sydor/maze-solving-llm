<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Let's start from the origin (0,0) and find a path to the target (4,4). We can see that there is an edge from (0,0) to (0,1), so we can move to (0,1). From (0,1), we can move to (0,2) or (0,3), but we can't move to (0,2) because there is a wall there. So, we move to (0,3). From (0,3), we can move to (0,4) or (1,3), but we have already visited (1,3) before, so we move to (0,4). From (0,4), we can move to (1,4) or (2,4), but we have already visited (2,4) before, so we move to (1,4). From (1,4), we can move to (2,4) or (3,4), but we have already visited (2,4) before, so we move to (3,4). From (3,4), we can move to (4,4), which is our target.

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution.
