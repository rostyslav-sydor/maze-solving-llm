<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
- Start at the origin (0,0).
- Move right to (1,0).
- Move down to (1,1).
- Move right to the target (4,4).

**Path validation:**
- [(0,0), (0,1)] is an adjacent move.
- [(0,1), (0,2)] is an adjacent move.
- [(0,2), (0,3)] is an adjacent move.
- [(0,3), (1,3)] is an adjacent move.
- [(1,3), (2,3)] is an adjacent move.
- [(2,3), (3,3)] is an adjacent move.
- [(3,3), (3,4)] is an adjacent move.
- [(3,4), (4,4)] is an adjacent move.

Therefore, the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
