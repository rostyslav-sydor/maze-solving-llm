<PATH_START> (4,4) (3,4) (3,3) (2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (0,1) (0,0) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
- Start at the origin (0,0) and move right until you hit a wall.
- Turn right and move up until you hit a wall.
- Turn right and move right until you hit the target (4,4).

This solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
