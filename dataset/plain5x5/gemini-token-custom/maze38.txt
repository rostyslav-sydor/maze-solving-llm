1. Starting from the origin (0,0), we can move to the adjacent cell (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move to (2,0) and then to (3,0).
3. From (3,0), we can move to (3,1) and then to (4,1).
4. From (4,1), we can move to (4,2) and then to (4,3).
5. From (4,3), we can move to (4,4), which is the target cell.

So the solution is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Let's check if this solution does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells:
1. The path does not cross any walls because each move is to an adjacent cell.
2. The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is to a cell that is either directly above, below, left, or right of the current cell.

Therefore, the solution is valid.
