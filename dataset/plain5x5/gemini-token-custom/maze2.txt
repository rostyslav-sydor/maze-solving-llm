<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

- Starting from the entry point at (0, 0), we move right to (1, 0) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (1, 0), we move down to (1, 1) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (1, 1), we move right to (1, 2) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (1, 2), we move right to (1, 3) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (1, 3), we move down to (2, 3) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (2, 3), we move right to (2, 4) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (2, 4), we move right to (3, 4) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 
- From (3, 4), we move right to (4, 4) since there is no wall blocking the movement. 


The calculated path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells, which satisfies the requirements of the maze solution.
