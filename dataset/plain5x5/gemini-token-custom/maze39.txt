1. Find the start and end points of the maze.
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (4,4) <TARGET_END>

2. Start from the start point and find all the adjacent cells.
 (0,0) -> [(0,1), (1,0)]

3. Check if any of the adjacent cells is the end point.
(0,1) is not the end point, (1,0) is not the end point.

4. If none of the adjacent cells is the end point, repeat step 2 and 3 for each of the adjacent cells.
(0,1) -> [(0,2), (1,1)]
(1,0) -> [(1,1), (2,0)]
(0,2) -> [(0,3), (1,2)]
(1,1) -> [(1,2), (2,1)]
(2,0) -> [(2,1), (3,0)]
(1,2) -> [(1,3), (2,2)]
(2,1) -> [(2,2), (3,1)]
(3,0) -> [(3,1), (4,0)]
(2,2) -> [(2,3), (3,2)]
(3,1) -> [(3,2), (4,1)]
(4,0) -> [(4,1), (3,0)]
(2,3) -> [(2,4), (1,3)]
(3,2) -> [(3,3), (4,2)]
(1,3) -> [(1,4), (0,3)]
(4,1) -> [(4,2), (3,1)]
(3,3) -> [(4,3), (2,3)]
(4,2) -> [(4,3), (3,2)]
(1,4) -> [(0,4), (2,4)]
(4,3) -> [(3,3), (4,4)]
(0,3) -> [(0,4), (1,3)]
(2,4) -> [(1,4), (3,4)]
(0,4) -> [(1,4), (0,3)]
(3,4) -> [(2,4), (4,4)]

5. Once the end point is found, backtrack the path from the end point to the start point.
(4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0)

6. Output the path as a list of coordinates.
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

7. Check if the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
The path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
