To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate through open passages while avoiding the walls represented by the thick black lines. By observing the image, we can trace a valid path from (0,0) to (4,4).

Here is the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
