To solve the maze provided, I will assume that a movement is possible from one cell to a neighboring cell if there are no walls blocking the way between them. Based on the visualization provided:

1. Start at the entrance (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move down to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Move right to (3,3).
8. Move down to (4,3).
9. Move right to the exit (4,4).

This moves from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner navigating through the available pathways.

Formatted path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
