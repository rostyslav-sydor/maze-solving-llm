To solve the maze, we will start at the given entry point (0,0) and navigate through the path to reach the exit at (4,4). I will specify a sequence of coordinates indicating the move from one cell to the next accessible cell without crossing the walls.

Here’s the solution for the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
