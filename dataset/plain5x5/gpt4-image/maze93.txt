To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), we can find a path avoiding any cells that are blocked by walls.

Starting from the entry point, observe the maze for navigable paths (without crossing any black lines depicted as walls) in each step towards the exit:

1. Start at (0,0). Move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the only way forward without a wall is down to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move down to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), move right to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move right to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move down to (3,3).
7. From (3,3), move down to (4,3).
8. From (4,3), move right to (4,4) which is the exit.

The path coordinates from start to finish are:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
