Based on the maze provided, the entry point is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (4,4). The walls are indicated by thick black lines that block movement between cells. Analyzing the maze, the path from start to finish, avoiding walls, can be traced as follows:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0).
3. Then to (2,0).
4. Then to (3,0).
5. Move to (3,1).
6. Move to (3,2). 
7. Then to (3,3).
8. Move to (3,4).
9. Then to (4,4) where the exit is located.

The complete step-by-step path coordinates are:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
