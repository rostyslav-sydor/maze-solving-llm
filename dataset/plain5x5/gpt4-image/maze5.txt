From the maze image you've provided, I will analyze the possible path options and provide the solution in terms of a sequence of coordinates. To get from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), the path must navigate through the openings between the walls.

Analyzing the maze, here's the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This solution takes the path right along the first column to the last row and then moves directly toward the exit along the bottom row.
