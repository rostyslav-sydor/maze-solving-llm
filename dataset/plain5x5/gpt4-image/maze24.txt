To solve the maze based on the image provided, we start from the entry point at (0,0) and aim to reach the exit point at (4,4) by navigating through paths that are not blocked by walls. I'll analyze the allowable paths and provide a list of coordinates that make up the solution path.

From the image, analyzing the paths:
- Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1).
- From (0,1), continue moving right to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
- Continue moving down from (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2).
- From (3,2), move to the right to (3,3).
- Move down from (3,3) to (4,3).
- Finally, move right from (4,3) to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the path from the entry to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>.
