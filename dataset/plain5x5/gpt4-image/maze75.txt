To solve the maze starting at (0,0) and reaching the exit at (4,4), I will trace through the maze observing the possible pathways:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Move right to (0,4).
6. Move down to (1,4).
7. Move down to (2,4).
8. Move down to (3,4).
9. Move down to (4,4).

Thus, the path through the maze from entrance to exit, tracing through the accessible cells, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
