To solve the maze presented in the image provided, with an entry point at (0,0) and exit at (4,4), we can follow these steps:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move down to (2,1).
5. Move right to (2,2).
6. Move right to (2,3).
7. Move down to (3,3).
8. Move down to (4,3).
9. Move right to (4,4), which is the exit.

The complete path from the entrance to the exit in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
