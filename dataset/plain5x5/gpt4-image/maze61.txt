To solve the maze provided and find a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), let's analyze the maze structure starting from the entry and exploring feasible pathways. Following the rules and navigating through available openings:

1. Start at (0,0). The only option is to move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move right to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move right to (0,4).
5. From (0,4), move down to (1,4).
6. From (1,4), move down to (2,4).
7. From (2,4), move left to (2,3).
8. From (2,3), move left to (2,2).
9. From (2,2), move down to (3,2).
10. From (3,2), move down to (4,2).
11. From (4,2), move right to (4,3).
12. From (4,3), move right to (4,4), the exit point.

Here is the solution path in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
