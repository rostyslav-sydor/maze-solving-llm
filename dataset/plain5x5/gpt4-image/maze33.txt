To solve the maze shown in the image, we can visually trace a path from the starting point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4). Here's the detailed path based on visible open routes avoiding the black walls:

1. Start at (0,0),
2. Move right to (0,1),
3. Move right to (0,2),
4. Move right to (0,3),
5. Move down to (1,3),
6. Move down to (2,3),
7. Move down to (3,3),
8. Move right to (3,4),
9. Move down to (4,4) where the exit is located.

Formatting this solution within the specified output format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
