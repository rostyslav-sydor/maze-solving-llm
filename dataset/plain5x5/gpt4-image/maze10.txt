To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), I analyzed the available paths visually, identifying possible routes while considering the walls of the maze as barriers. Following such an assessment, here's an appropriate path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates reveals a possible path from the start to the finish of the maze without crossing any walls.
