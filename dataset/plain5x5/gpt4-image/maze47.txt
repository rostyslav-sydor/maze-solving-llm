To solve the maze provided in the image, I will analyze the grid with the identified walls and find a route from the starting point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4).

Observing the image, here is a viable solution:

- Start at (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the maze.
- Move right to (0,1) and (0,2).
- Move down to (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2).
- Move right to (3,3).
- Move down to (4,3).
- Move right to (4,4), which is the bottom-right corner.

Here is the path in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
