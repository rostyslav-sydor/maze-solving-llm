To solve the maze, we can start at the entry point (0,0) and proceed to find a path to the exit point (4,4) by navigating through open paths indicated by the absence of black lines between cells.

Path from (0,0) to (4,4):

1. Start at (0,0), move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move down to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move down to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), move right to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move right to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move right to (2,4).
7. From (2,4), move down to (3,4).
8. From (3,4), move down to (4,4) which is the exit.

The complete navigable path would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
