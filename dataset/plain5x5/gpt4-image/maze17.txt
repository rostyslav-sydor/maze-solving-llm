To find a path through the maze from (0,0) to (4,4), I will analyze the image and describe a sequence of moves that reaches the exit point by navigating through the open passages while avoiding walls.

Starting from (0,0), move as follows:
1. Down to (1,0)
2. Down to (2,0)
3. Right to (2,1)
4. Right to (2,2)
5. Down to (3,2)
6. Down to (4,2)
7. Right to (4,3)
8. Right to (4,4) (Exit point)

These steps describe the walking path through the maze. Here it is wrapped with the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
