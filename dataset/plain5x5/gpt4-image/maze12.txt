To navigate the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (4,4) while respecting the walls, I'll trace out the path following the allowed passages:

Starting at (0,0), the path is as follows:

- Move right to (0,1)
- Move right to (0,2)
- Move down to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move right to (2,3)
- Move right to (2,4)
- Move down to (3,4)
- Move down to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the sequence of coordinates representing the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>.
