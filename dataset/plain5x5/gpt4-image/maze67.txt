Based on the provided image of the 5x5 maze and tracing a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), avoiding blocked paths indicated by the thick black lines, the solution can be found as follows:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move right to (0,1)
- Move right to (0,2)
- Move down to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move down to (3,2)
- Move right to (3,3)
- Move right to (3,4)
- Move down to (4,4) which is the exit.

Thus, the solution path from the entry to the exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
