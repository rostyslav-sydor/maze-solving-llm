To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), I have examined the image and traced a possible route that moves through free spaces (cells without thick black walls). Here is the solution path for the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
