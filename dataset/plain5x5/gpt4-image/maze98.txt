In order to find the solution for the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), I'll analyze the maze and provide a path that navigates through the open cells avoiding the walls.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Since (0,4) is blocked by a wall, move down to (1,3).
6. Move down to (2,3).
7. Move left to (2,2).
8. Move left to (2,1).
9. Move down to (3,1).
10. Move down to (4,1).
11. Move right to (4,2).
12. Move right to (4,3).
13. Finally, move right to reach (4,4).

Formatting this sequence of moves with the required tokens, the complete path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
