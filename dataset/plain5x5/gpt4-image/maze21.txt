To solve this maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate to the exit point (4,4) while avoiding the walls. I will analyze the maze and provide a path.

From the entry point:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to the right to (0,1).
3. Continue to the right to (0,2).
4. Continue to the right to (0,3).
5. Move down to (1,3).
6. Continue down to (2,3).
7. Move right to (2,4).
8. Move down to (3,4).
9. Go down to reach the exit at (4,4).

The successful path from (0,0) to (4,4) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
