To solve the maze from (0,0) to (4,4) while navigating through free spaces and avoiding walls marked as thick black lines, we can trace a path visually or algorithmically. Based on the provided image:

Starting at (0,0), it appears that the feasible path proceeds as follows:

1. Move right to (0,1)
2. Move right to (0,2)
3. Move down to (1,2)
4. Move down to (2,2)
5. Move right to (2,3)
6. Move down to (3,3)
7. Move right to (3,4)
8. Move down to (4,4) - the exit

Here's this route represented between the specified tokens:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
