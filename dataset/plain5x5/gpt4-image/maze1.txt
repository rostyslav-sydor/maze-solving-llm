To solve the maze, one needs to find a path from the entry point (0,0) at the top left to the exit point (4,4) at the bottom right, considering the walls marked with thick black lines. Analyzing the maze from the entry to the exit, the path can be deduced. Here is the optimal route:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
