To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate to the exit point (4,4) by moving through open paths (cells without walls between them).

From examining the paths, we can navigate the maze:

1. Start at (0,0) – the only way is to move right.
2. Move right to (0,1) – continue moving right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) you can go directly down to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2).
4. At (4,2), move right to (4,3) and then to the exit at (4,4).

Combining these steps into a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
