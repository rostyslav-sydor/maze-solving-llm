To find a solution for this maze, we will navigate from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (4,4) while accounting for the walls. Here's a step-by-step path based on the image:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Move right to (0,4).
6. Move down to (1,4).
7. Move down to (2,4).
8. Move down to (3,4).
9. Move down to (4,4).

Using the instructions to format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
