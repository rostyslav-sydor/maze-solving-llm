To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), I will analyze the given maze structure based on the available paths delineated by the thick black lines representing walls.

I have determined an appropriate path that avoids walls and navigates from the entry to the exit. Here is the solution in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
