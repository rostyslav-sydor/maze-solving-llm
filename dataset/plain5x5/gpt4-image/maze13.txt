To solve the maze provided in the image, let's trace a valid path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), adhering to the paths between the walls:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move down to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move right to (2,3).
7. Move right to (2,4).
8. Move down to (3,4).
9. Move down to (4,4), which is the exit point.

The path in the proper format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
