To solve the 5x5 maze provided in the image, I analyzed the paths visually and identified a route from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (4,4) that doesn't cross through any walls.

Here's the sequence of moves through the maze:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to the right to (0,1), and then to (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4).
3. Move downwards to (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), and finally to (4,4) which is the exit.

Thus, the path coordinates from start to exit are:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
