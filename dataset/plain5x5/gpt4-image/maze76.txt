To solve the 5x5 maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), by observing the absence and presence of walls in the maze image, I can suggest the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path traverses only through the open spaces and avoids any walls, leading from the entry to the exit.
