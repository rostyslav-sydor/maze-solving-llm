To solve the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), we trace the path through the grid by avoiding the walls (thick black lines). 

Given how the walls are positioned in each cell, here’s a possible path from the start to the finish:

From (0,0), we:
1. Move right to (0,1)
2. Move right to (0,2)
3. Move right to (0,3)
4. Move down to (1,3)
5. Move down to (2,3)
6. Move left to (2,2)
7. Move left to (2,1)
8. Move down to (3,1)
9. Move right to (3,2)
10. Move right to (3,3)
11. Move down to (4,3)
12. Move right to (4,4) (exit)

Outputted in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
