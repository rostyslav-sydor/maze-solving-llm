To solve the maze, we need to start from the entry point (0,0) and find a path to the exit point (4,4). After examining the maze, the pathway through without hitting any walls, considering the thick black lines as impassable walls, goes as follows:

You move right from (0,0) to (0,1), then down to (3,1). From there you move right to (3,4), and finally down from (3,4) to (4,4). 

Composing this into the list format you've specified:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
