To solve this maze, I'll trace the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), navigating through the openings between the walls.

Starting at the top left corner:
1. Move down to (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), then to (4,0) because there are no walls blocking the southward movement in the first column.
2. From (4,0), move right to (4,1), (4,2) because the path is open.
3. Move up to (3,2) because there is a wall blocking further eastward movement at row 4.
4. Move right again to (3,3), and (3,4) because the path is clear.
5. From (3,4), head north to (2,4), (1,4), and finally to the exit point at (0,4).

Here is the path in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (2,4) (1,4) (0,4) <PATH_END>
