To solve the maze shown in the image, we need to find a path from the entry point at the top-left corner (0,0) to the exit point at the bottom-right corner (4,4). By visual inspection and following the open paths avoiding the walls:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Move right to (0,4).
6. Move down to (1,4).
7. Move down to (2,4).
8. Move left to (2,3).
9. Move down to (3,3).
10. Move down to (4,3).
11. Move right to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the sequence of moves in coordinate format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
