To solve the maze based on the entry point at (0,0) and the exit point at (4,4), I will trace a path through the maze considering the positions of the walls as shown in the image:

<PATH_START> 
(0,0) 
(1,0) 
(2,0) 
(2,1) 
(2,2) 
(3,2) 
(4,2) 
(4,3) 
(4,4) 
<PATH_END> 

This sequence of coordinates represents a possible route from the entrance to the exit, navigating around the walls as indicated. Each move is to an adjacent cell, either horizontally or vertically, where there is no wall in the way.
