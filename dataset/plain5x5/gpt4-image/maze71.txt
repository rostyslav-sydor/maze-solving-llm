To solve the maze, I'll analyze the image and trace a valid path from the starting point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) while avoiding walls.

Starting at (0,0), the path can move as follows:
1. Move straight down from (0,0) to (3,0) as there are no walls blocking the downward path in the first column.
2. From (3,0), move right to (3,1).
3. Move right again from (3,1) to (3,3) as there's a wall between (3,3) and (3,4).
4. From (3,3), move down to (4,3).
5. Finally, move right from (4,3) to (4,4), reaching the exit.

Let's put this in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
