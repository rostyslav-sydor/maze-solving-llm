To solve the maze based on the image provided, I will identify a path that moves from the entry coordinate (0,0) to the exit coordinate (4,4) avoiding the barriers marked by thick black lines.

Analyzing the image, here is the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
