To find a solution path through the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (4,4), I have analyzed the paths between cells where walls are not present.

Here's the viable solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the entry to the exit, moving through open passages and avoiding walls.
