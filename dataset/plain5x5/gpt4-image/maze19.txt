To solve a maze like this, one can follow paths from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) considering the restrictions imposed by walls.

Based on the image provided, a possible solution for the maze with entry from (0,0) and exit at (4,4) is provided below:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
