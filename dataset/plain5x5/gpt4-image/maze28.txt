To solve the maze, we will find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). Let's examine each cell carefully based on the image provided:

1. Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1) as it's the only possible path without hitting a wall.
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), the only unobstructed path is to (0,4).
5. Then move from (0,4) to (1,4) as moving down is the only option without a wall blocking the path.
6. From (1,4) proceed to (2,4).
7. Then, move to (3,4).
8. From (3,4), move to (4,4), which is the exit point.

Putting this together in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
