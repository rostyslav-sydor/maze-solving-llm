To solve the maze from (0,0) to (4,4), I'll interpret the image and provide a path that navigates through open passages while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, it's clear that:

1. From (0,0), the path can move right to (0,1).
2. Continue to (0,2).
3. Move down to (1,2).
4. Move right to (1,3).
5. Move right to (1,4).
6. Move down to (2,4).
7. Move down to (3,4).
8. Move down to (4,4).

This path does not encounter any walls and reaches the destination successfully.

Formatted as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
