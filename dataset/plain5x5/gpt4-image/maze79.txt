To solve the maze starting from the entry point at (0,0) and reaching the exit point at (4,4), I'll trace the path avoiding thick black walls as they are the barriers:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).
3. Move down to (1,3) and (2,3).
4. Move right to (2,4).
5. Move down to (3,4) and (4,4).

Thus, the solution path in the specified format will be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
