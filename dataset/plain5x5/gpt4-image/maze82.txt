To solve the maze provided, let's consider that we can only travel between adjacent cells and cannot cross the thick black lines. Starting from the entry point at (0,0), we analyze the feasible paths:

- From (0, 0), move to (1, 0) - down.
- From (1, 0), move to (2, 0) - down.
- From (2, 0), move to (3, 0) - down.
- From (3, 0), move to (4, 0) - down.
- From (4, 0), move to (4, 1) - right.
- From (4, 1), move to (4, 2) - right.
- From (4, 2), move to (4, 3) - right.
- From (4, 3), move to (4, 4) - right to reach the exit point.

Putting it in the desired format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
