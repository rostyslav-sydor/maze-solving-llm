To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (4,4), I will plot the path visually tracing through the open passages:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move down to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Move right to (3,3).
8. Move down to (4,3).
9. Move right to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the solution, formatted according to your instructions:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
