To solve the 5x5 maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4) with the walls as shown in the image, I've traced the possible path through the maze taking into consideration where the walls are. Below is the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
