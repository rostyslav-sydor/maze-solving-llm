Observing the maze, the solution path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) can be navigated as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This route follows a clear path avoiding the thick black walls and finds the way directly from the start to the finish along the maze grid.
