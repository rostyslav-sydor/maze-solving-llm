To solve the 5x5 maze provided, I will analyze the grid and identify a possible path from the entry point at the top left corner (coordinate (0,0)) to the exit point at the bottom right corner (coordinate (4,4)), while avoiding the walls marked by the thick black lines.

Here is one such path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This path traverses from the start point straight down the first column, moves to the bottom row, and then proceeds directly to the exit by moving horizontally across the row to the rightmost column.
