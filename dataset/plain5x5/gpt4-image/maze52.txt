To solve the maze, the goal is to find a valid route from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4) while navigating through open paths and avoiding walls:

By analyzing the given maze image, the viable path from the starting point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) appears as follows:

1. (0,0) to (0,1)
2. (0,1) to (0,2)
3. (0,2) to (0,3)
4. (0,3) to (0,4)
5. (0,4) to (1,4)
6. (1,4) to (2,4)
7. (2,4) to (3,4)
8. (3,4) to (4,4)

Therefore, the complete solution path in the required format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
