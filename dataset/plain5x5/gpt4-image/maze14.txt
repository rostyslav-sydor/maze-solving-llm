Analyzing the maze from the given image, I will find the path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4).

The solution path, navigating around the walls marked with black lines and considering allowable movements to the right or down whenever possible (and up or left when necessary), is:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)
<PATH_END> 

Each coordinate in the solution indicates a step where the path is free of walls according to the maze's grid layout.
