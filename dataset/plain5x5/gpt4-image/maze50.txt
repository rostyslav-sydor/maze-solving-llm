To solve the maze you presented, I will analyze the structure and provide you with the path details from the entry (0,0) to the exit (4,4). Let's begin by identifying the possible ways at each junction, considering the walls of the maze.

1. Start at (0,0). The only move available is to go right to (0,1).
2. Move from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3).
4. Move from (0,3) to (0,4).
5. Move from (0,4) to (1,4).
6. Move from (1,4) to (2,4).
7. Move from (2,4) down to (3,4).
8. Move from (3,4) down to (4,4), the exit point.

Tracking back the coordinated path from start to exit, it forms the following sequence:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
This path follows the right and down directions through the maze, avoiding any enclosed walls.
