To find a solution to navigate through the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), I analyzed the maze's structure based on the image you provided. Here's the path that navigates through the maze without hitting any walls:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This route ensures that movement is only made through passable paths without crossing any black lines, representing walls in the maze.
