To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate through the maze to reach the exit at (4,4). Following a path with open routes according to the visualization and avoiding walls:

- Begin at (0,0)
- Move right to (0,1)
- Move right to (0,2)
- Move down to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move down to (3,2)
- Move left to (3,1)
- Move down to (4,1)
- Move right to (4,2)
- Move right to (4,3)
- Move right to (4,4), which is the exit point.

Here is the solution enclosed as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
