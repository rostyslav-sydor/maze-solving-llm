Based on the image of the maze you provided, the solution to traverse from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4) while navigating through the passable paths (not crossing any thick black lines indicating walls) can be outlined as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
