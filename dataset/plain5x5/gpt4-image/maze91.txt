To find a solution for the given 5x5 maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), I'll analyze the paths based on the image provided.

Analyzing the maze paths step-by-step:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Move right to (2,0).
4. Move right to (3,0).
5. Move down to (3,1).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Move right to (4,2). 
8. Move down to (4,3).
9. Move down to (4,4).

The complete path from entry to exit is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
