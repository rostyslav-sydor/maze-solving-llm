To solve the maze provided in the image from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), I will analyze the accessible paths from the entrance to the exit, avoiding the walls marked as thick black lines. Here is the step-by-step path description:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Move down to (1,3).
6. Move down to (2,3).
7. Move down to (3,3).
8. Move down to (4,3).
9. Move right to (4,4).

Putting these coordinates in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
