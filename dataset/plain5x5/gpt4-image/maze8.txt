To solve the maze, I will analyze the possible paths from the entry point at (0,0) and find a successful route that reaches the exit at (4,4), avoiding walls.

By observing the image:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3).
3. Move down to (1,3), (2,3).
4. Move right to (2,4).
5. Move down to the exit point (3,4), (4,4).

With the solution identified, the path is formatted as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
