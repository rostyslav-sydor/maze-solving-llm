Based on the layout of the maze provided in the image, the solution can be traced as follows:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move right to (0,1)
- Move right to (0,2)
- Move down to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move down to (3,2)
- Move down to (4,2)
- Move right to (4,3)
- Move right to (4,4), where the exit is located.

Therefore, the path from the entrance to the exit of the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
