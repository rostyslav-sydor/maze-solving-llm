To solve the maze, I will trace a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4) by moving through the open passages, avoiding the walls.

Starting at (0,0), the path can be planned as follows:
1. Move right to (0,1).
2. Move right to (0,2).
3. Move right to (0,3).
4. Move right to (0,4).
5. Move down to (1,4).
6. Move down to (2,4).
7. Move down to (3,4).
8. Move down to (4,4).

The complete path from entry to exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
