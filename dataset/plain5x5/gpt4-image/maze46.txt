To solve the maze and provide a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), I will analyze the maze visually and trace a possible route through the open passages.

Upon examination, a feasible path can traverse the following steps:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move right to (0,1)
3. Move down to (1,1)
4. Move down to (2,1)
5. Move down to (3,1)
6. Move down to (4,1)
7. Move right to (4,2)
8. Move right to (4,3)
9. Move right to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the coordinate list of the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
