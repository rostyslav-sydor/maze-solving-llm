To solve the maze provided, I'll analyze the possible paths starting from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), bypassing walls as necessary. I'll then list the coordinates.

Analyzing the maze:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move down to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Move right to (3,3).
8. Move right to (3,4).
9. Move down to (4,4) which is the exit.

Assembling these moves into the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
