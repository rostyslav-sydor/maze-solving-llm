To solve the maze depicted in the image you provided, I will analyze the walls and determine a valid path from the entrance point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4). Let's begin navigating the maze step by step through the open corridors.

Starting at (0,0):
1. Move right to (0,1) and (0,2).
2. Move down to (1,2) and (2,2).
3. There is an open path to the right, so move to (2,3) and (2,4).
4. Move down to (3,4) and finally (4,4) to reach the exit.

So, the complete path from the entry to the exit point, written in the requested format, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>.
