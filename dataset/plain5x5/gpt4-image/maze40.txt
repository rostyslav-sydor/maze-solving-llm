To find a solution for the maze based on the given image, let's trace the possible path from the entry point at the top-left corner (0,0) to the exit point at the bottom-right corner (4,4), moving only where no walls block the way. 

Starting at (0,0):
- Move right to (0,1)
- Move right to (0,2)
- Move down to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move left to (2,1)
- Move down to (3,1)
- Move down to (4,1)
- Move right to (4,2)
- Move right to (4,3)
- Move right to (4,4)

The complete path in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
