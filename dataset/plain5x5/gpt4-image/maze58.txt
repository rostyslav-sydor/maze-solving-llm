To solve the maze and navigate from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4), let's trace a valid path through the maze:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4).
3. Move down to (1,4).
4. Move down further to (2,4).
5. Move to (3,4).
6. Finally, reach (4,4).

Now, I will format this path as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
