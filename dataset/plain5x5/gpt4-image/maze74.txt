To solve the maze provided in the image, I will analyze the pathways and select a possible route from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4) by navigating around the walls.

Let's trace a path:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move right to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Move right to (3,3).
8. Move right to (3,4).
9. Move down to (4,4), which is the exit.

Compiling the path coordinates between the tokens:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
