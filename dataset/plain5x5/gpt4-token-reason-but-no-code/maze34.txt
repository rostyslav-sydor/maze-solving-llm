To solve the maze, we need to determine the shortest path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,4) using the adjacency list provided.

**Analysis and Reasoning:**
1. The adjacency list specifies all possible movements between points in the maze.
2. Starting from the entry point (0,0), our aim is to gradually explore accessible points until we reach the destination (4,4).
3. We'll employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy, as it is suited for unweighted graphs like this maze, providing the shortest path due to its level-wise expansion.

**Steps:**
1. Parse the adjacency list to convert it into a usable format that represents the maze structure in a graph format.
2. Use the BFS approach starting from (0,0):
    - Enqueue the starting point and mark it as visited.
    - Expand each node by exploring all connected nodes (as per adjacency list), enqueue them if they haven't been visited, and keep track of the path.
    - Continue this process until the target (4,4) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted.
3. As paths are explored, track the parent of each node to reconstruct the shortest path once (4,4) is reached.

**Resulting Path Calculation:**
Upon using BFS strategy:
- Start from (0,0) and examine adjacent points. List visited nodes and queue potential moves.
- Reach (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4).

Each coordinate move is derived from the adjacency relationships, ensuring all moves are valid and result in the shortest path through BFS traversal.

**Final Maze Solution Representation:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Expressed through these coordinates, this pathway efficiently navigates from the starting point to the target, per the maze's design and connectivity detailed in the adjacency list.
