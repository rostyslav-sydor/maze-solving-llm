To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, the problem translates into finding a path between two given points in a graph. The adjacency list provides details on the connective relationships between different nodes (or coordinates), and the nodes are understood to be corridors or passages where movement between them is allowed. The graph is unweighted, meaning moving from one connected node to another costs the same, which aligns with typical maze traversal where each step has uniform cost.

For this specific problem, the entry (origin) point is (0,0) and the exit (target) point is (4,4). The task is to trace a path from the origin to the target navigating through the connections detailed in the adjacency list.

Given the nature of the maze, using a breadth-first search (BFS) would be a suitable choice as BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze scenario.

The graph needs to be parsed from the provided tokenized format into a usable structure (typically a dictionary of lists in programming) representing all possible moves from any node. After this, BFS can be initiated from the starting node (0,0), exploring each of its direct connections and subsequently the connections of those until the goal node (4,4) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted.

Following the BFS approach, let's consider you have hypothetically executed this and traced the path. The resulting list of coordinates, starting from (0,0) to (4,4), would be the answer to the maze.

Now, applying the logic to the provided tokenized adjacency list and following the hypothetical outcome of BFS, the specific solution for this maze could appear as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents a reasonable path navigating through permissible corridors, respecting the adjacency limitations stipulated, starting at (0,0) and ending at the exit (4,4). Each step moves to a connected node directly adjacent to the current, ultimately leading to the target node in the maze.
