To address the maze problem presented as an adjacency list, the given graph specifies all the possible movements between coordinates on what appears to be a 5x5 grid (from (0,0) to (4,4)).

**Analysis of the Maze:**
- The maze connections are given explicitly, showing which grid points are directly connected to others.
- The start (origin) of the maze is defined as (0,0) and the target (exit) is defined at (4,4).

**Approach to Solution:**
- This problem is equivalent to finding a path in a graph from the defined start node to the defined end node.
- A suitable method to find such a path in an undirected graph (as no direction is specified between points) could be Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is optimal for this since it will return the shortest path between the start vertex and the end vertex.

**Specific Solution Process:**
1. Parse the adjacency list to construct the graph in a structured form, like a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of connected vertices.
2. Implement BFS to navigate through the graph from the start vertex, spreading out level by level and recording the paths taken.
3. Once the BFS reaches the target vertex, backtrack through the recorded paths to reconstruct the path from start to target.
4. The sequence of moves (coordinates) from the BFS traversal provides the required solution.

**Derived Path Solution:**
Applying BFS manually or programmatically from (0,0) and navigating through the paths as per the adjacency connections provided, I deduced the shortest route (or one of the shortest routes if multiple paths with the same length exist) to be:

- Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) as it's linked.
- From (1,0), go to (2,0).
- Move from (2,0) to (3,0), then proceed to (4,0).
- From (4,0), move up to (4,1), proceed to (4,2), then to (4,3).
- Finally, from (4,3) move to the target at (4,4).

This path is confirmed by the adjacency links provided, following one of the simplest ways through a breadth-first exploration of the graph.

**Final Better-Formated Path Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
