To solve this maze, we start by interpreting the adjacency list as a representation of a graph where each node is a coordinate in the maze and edges denote direct pathways between two nodes. Our goal is to navigate from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4) by following the pathways provided in the adjacency list.

First, we ensure the origin (0,0) and the target (4,4) are valid nodes on the graph using the adjacency list provided. Both these nodes have defined connections indicating the potential paths available.

To determine the solution path, we can make use of a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores the nodes and edges and determines a path from origin to target if one exists. BFS is often preferred in such situations as it finds the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

Using BFS, we start at node (0,0) and explore each connected node, marking each visited to avoid revisiting and creating loops. We continue the exploration level by level (using a queue aide), branching out based on available connections until we reach the target node (4,4). Each explored node keeps track of its predecessor to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

After setting up and running BFS, we connect all predecessors from the target back to the source, creating a list of coordinates forming the path in order the nodes are traveled.

From the provided adjacency list, analysis and BFS traversal results in the following path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence is the shortest route from the origin to the destination through the maze, passing through each required coordinate, confirmed by the existence of a direct connection or edge between subsequent coordinates in the path list.
