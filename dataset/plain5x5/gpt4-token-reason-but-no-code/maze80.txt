The maze provided in the question uses an adjacency list to show which points (nodes) are directly connected to each other, indicating valid pathways. The origins and targets are clearly marked, which allows us to identify the start and end points for navigating through the maze.

Given the start point (0,0) and the end point (4,4), the challenge involves tracing a viable path between these points considering the direct connections indicated by the adjacency list.

We can employ either Depth-First Search (DFS) as it explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking, or Breadth-First Search (BFS) which explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. In this situation, BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, and thus, it would be an appropriate choice to find a solution to this maze from the entrance to the exit.

Using BFS or a similar algorithm applied to the adjacency list would involve exploring each node and tracing back the path to the start once the target node (4,4) is found. Each explored node would be checked to ensure we aren't revisiting nodes, ensuring the maze resolves to the shortest path - especially as each node in this maze scenario can only have a few connected neighbors (up to four, standard for grid-based mazes).

Therefore, by methodically verifying adjacent node connections and ensuring we capture the path once reaching the goal, it is possible to formulate the correct path by tracking nodes back to the starting node from the node reached at the target.

Applying the above reasoning to the given graph from start to target and following through with BFS algorithm on the adjacency list, we get the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path effectively moves from the designated start point, explores through connected points based on the adjacency list, reaching the destination using valid connections only. The steps in this path are consecutive moves between adjacent nodes leading from the origin to the target.
