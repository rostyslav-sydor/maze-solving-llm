To find a solution to the maze described, I interpreted the maze as a graph where each point `(x, y)` represents a node and each connection `<-->` between points describes an edge. Given this setup, determining a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,4)` requires finding a path through this graph from the starting node to the target node.

For solving the path:
1. I started from the origin point `(0,0)`.
2. Using a graph traversal technique such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, I traced all accessible nodes from the origin.
3. BFS uses a queue mechanism for exploring nodes in breadth-wise motion ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted graph by exploring all nodes level by level.
4. Each node is traversed, and its neighbors are added to a queue for further exploration. Visited nodes are marked to avoid reprocessing and to backtrace the path.
5. Upon reaching the target `(4,4)`, the traversal can stop, and the path back to the origin can be reconstructed using the recorded parent links.

Following the reachable connections given in the adjacency list, and applying BFS, the shortest path is determined. The plan involved piecing together consecutive reachable nodes from the adjacency list, following through a practical and direct connection route which leads from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`.

Here is the path solution for the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path provides a way through the maze from the starting point to the exit using valid connections as listed.
