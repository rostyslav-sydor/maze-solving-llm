Based on the given adjacency list, the maze can be visualized as a network where each node represents a coordinate in the grid and edges represent possible paths between these nodes. With the specified origin (0,0) and the target (4,4), the goal is to find a path between these two points following the connections given.

To solve the maze:
1. I assess the connections started from the origin and try to move systematically towards the target.
2. At each step, I choose a node (coordinate) that progresses towards the target by exploring its neighbors (direct connections).

Using the adjacency list, I start from the origin, explore connected nodes, and gradually expand this search until I reach the target. Whenever multiple paths are available, I prioritize by proximity or directness towards the target if possible.

Following the adjacency list paths, I find the path as:
- Start at (0,0), which connects directly to (0,1)
- The next possible consecutive connection from (0,1) leads to (0,2)
- Continue from (0,2) to (0,3)
- From (0,3), move to the adjacent (0,4)
- Next, progress to (1,4) which is connected to (0,4)
- From (1,4), you can move to (1,3) and subsequently to (2,4)
- Following the path (2,4) connects directly to (3,4)
- Finally, (3,4) connects to the target (4,4)

Following this sequence of movements, a clear path can be defined from the origin to the target. Each move stays directly within the bounds of adjacency as provided by the list without breaking any rules of connectivity or revisiting any node more than once.

Thus, the solution to the maze is specified as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This path successfully connects the origin to the target using valid connected paths as described in the adjacency list provided.
