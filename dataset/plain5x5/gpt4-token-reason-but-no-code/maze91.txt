The adjacency list provided represents a graph where each node is a coordinate in a maze and each edge represents a path between two adjacent points in the maze. To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the starting point `(0,0)` to the ending point `(4,4)`.

Considering the nature of the maze (which can be visualized as a graph with vertices and edges based on the adjacency given), the strategy to find the path efficiently is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable as it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze like this.

1. Starting from `(0,0)`, use BFS to traverse through the graph.
2. Maintain a queue to explore nodes level by level.
3. Keep track of visited nodes to prevent re-exploring them, which is critical in a maze to avoid loops or going in circles.
4. For each node, if it is not the target node `(4,4)`, add all its immediate unvisited neighbors to the queue.
5. For each node visited, record the node from which it came. This is essential to backtrack from the target node back to the source once the destination is reached.
6. When the target `(4,4)` is reached, backtrack using the record of where each node came from, constructing the path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`.

Using this strategy, let’s derive the solution applying BFS to the adjacency list.

Translating the adjacency list to a solution involves:
- Starting at `(0,0)`, based on BFS, potential path decisions are directed by immediate connectivities or edges, aiming directly or indirectly towards `(4,4)`.
- Maneuvering through available paths while avoiding revisits until reaching `(4,4)`.

Given the maze's adjacencies and BFS operation, the path found is:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>`

This sequence efficiently moves from the origin `(0,0)` to target `(4,4)`, respecting the provided immediate neighbor connections and ensuring this specific path solution adheres to the BFS priority of exploring all possible paths level by level, retaining the shortest path discovery to the maze’s exit.
