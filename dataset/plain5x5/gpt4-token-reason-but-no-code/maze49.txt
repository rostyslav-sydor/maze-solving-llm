The maze description provided essentially constructs a graph with nodes marked by coordinates and edges representing allowable paths between these nodes. The goal is to move from an entry node (origin) to an exit node (target). This scenario is a classical example where graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) excel because they can explore all the reachable nodes from a given starting point and determine the shortest path (in the case of BFS) or any path (in DFS).

Applying the BFS approach ensures the shortest path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,4)` is found:

1. **Initialization**: Begin from the origin `(0,0)`.
2. **Exploration**: From each node, explore all directly connected nodes (coordinates) by examining all tuple pairs in the list, marking each visited node to prevent revisitation and adding each to a queue for further exploration.
3. **Path Construction**: By keeping track of each node's predecessor, we can reconstruct the path once the target is reached by backtracking from the target to the origin using the predecessor links.
4. **Completion**: The BFS guarantees that the first time a node is reached, it is done by the shortest path possible due to the layer-wise exploration inherent in BFS.

For the maze provided, executing our BFS on the adjacency list begins at `(0,0)` and explores nodes layer by layer until `(4,4)` is encountered. Given the list of connections between nodes:

The shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` is derived as following the possible shortest paths and predecessors set during BFS:

- Start at `(0,0)`, from here you can move to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
- From `(0,1)`, move to `(0,2)`, then to `(0,3)`.
- From `(0,3)`, move to `(1,3)`, and so forth continuing this exploration.
- Continue this exploration until reaching the node `(4,4)`.

```plaintext
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)
```

Based on the BFS exploration from the provided adjacency list graph, we have:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path is verified to be valid with all steps having direct connections as per the adjacency list, and represents a possible shortest path through the maze to the target.
