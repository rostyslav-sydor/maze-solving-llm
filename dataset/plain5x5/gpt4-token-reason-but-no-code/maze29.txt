To find the path through the maze described, we first need to convert the adjacency list into a more manageable form, such as a dictionary where keys are nodes (coordinates) and values are lists of adjacent nodes. This way, we can easily traverse from one vertex (coordinate) to another, checking for connections as we move.

The adjacency list you provided connects various coordinates in a grid. The mazeâ€™s entry and exit points are defined as (0,0) and (4,4), respectively. By converting the list into a navigable graph structure, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to find a path from the entry to the exit.

For this maze, using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is suitable. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which is beneficial in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this.

After setting up the BFS:

1. Begin at the node (0,0).
2. Use a queue to explore all adjacent nodes.
3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisits and loops.
4. Track the path using a predecessor or parent dictionary.
5. Once we reach the node (4,4), trace back using the parent dictionary to list the path.

Applying the BFS to the maze considering all listed connections, we find the shortest path as follows:

- Start at (0,0), the only adjacent node is (0,1).
- From (0,1) move to (0,2).
- Continue from (0,2) to (0,3) and then to (0,4).
- Next, from (0,4) proceed to (1,4).
- (1,4) leads to (2,4).
- (2,4) connects to (3,4).
- Finally, from (3,4) reach to (4,4), the exit.

This connected sequence represents the shortest path through the maze from the entry to the exit, navigating through available passages as defined by the adjacency relationships.

Therefore, the solution format for this specific maze, with the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4), is given below:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
