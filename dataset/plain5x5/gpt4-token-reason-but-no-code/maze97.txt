To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list, we can use graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). These algorithms are effective for searching paths in a graph structure, which is how the maze is described.

**Adjacency List and Graph Representation:**
The adjacency list defines connections or passages between cells in the maze. For example, `(3,1) <--> (3,0)` suggests you can move between these two coordinates directly. The entry point of the maze is `(0,0)`, and the exit point is `(4,4)`.

**Algorithm Choice and Reasoning:**
BFS is particularly suitable for this task as it explores the nearest nodes first before moving to deeper levels, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted graph like our maze. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to explore next and typically stores nodes to ensure each node is visited no more than once.

**Execution of BFS:**
1. Start at the origin `(0,0)` and enqueue it.
2. For each node dequeued, enqueue its adjacent nodes (from the adjacency list) if they have not been visited.
3. Continue until the target `(4,4)` is reached.
4. Additionally, track the path by maintaining where each node was visited from. This way, once the target is reached, you can backtrack from the exit to the entrance to determine the pathway.

**Solution:**
Following the BFS algorithm and parsing the given adjacency list, I would determine a viable pathway from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` by:
- Starting at `(0,0)` and exploring adjacent nodes.
- Continuing to explore adjacent unvisited nodes while noting the path.
- Upon reaching `(4,4)`, trace back using the stored paths.

Based on this explanation, here's the path obtained with BFS in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path traverses through each connected node as stored from the BFS traversal, ensuring it is one of the shortest routes through the maze from the designated entrance to the exit.
