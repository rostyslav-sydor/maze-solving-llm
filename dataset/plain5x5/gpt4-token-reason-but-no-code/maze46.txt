To solve this maze, the approach involves building the graph from the adjacency list and then applying a pathfinding algorithm to locate a route from the origin to the target. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**: Build the graph from the provided adjacency list where each node (coordinate) is linked to its neighboring coordinate as given in the adjacency relationships.

2. **Choosing a Pathfinding Algorithm**: Among popular choices like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS is ideal for unweighted mazes as it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of moves.

3. **Applying the Algorithm**:
   - Start from the origin node (0,0).
   - Explore all connected nodes layer by layer (all nodes reachable in 1 move, then 2 moves, etc.).
   - Continue exploration until the target node (4,4) is reached.
   - At each step, keep track of the nodes that have been visited and the path taken to reach there, to avoid loops and to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Upon reaching the target, backtrack using the recorded paths from the parents of each node to determine the exact moves taken from the origin to the target.

5. **Outcome**: The path found using the BFS approach gives the sequence of coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4) representing one of the shortest paths through the maze.

Let's illustrate how BFS would work on this maze. Starting at (0,0), according to the adjacency list:

- From (0,0), you can go to (1,0).
- From (1,0), continue to (1,1), then (0,1).
- Move from (0,1) to (0,2) and then to (0,3).
- From (0,3) go to (1,3) and next to (2,3).
- Proceed from (2,3) to (2,4) and then to (3,4).
- Finally, from (3,4), move to (4,4) - the target.

Thus, the consecutive moves from the origin to the target will traverse through various nodes based on the given adjacency, forming a feasible path.

**Final specific solution for the maze**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This solution corresponds to one of the possible shortest paths from the start to the end in the maze given the adjacency list provided.
