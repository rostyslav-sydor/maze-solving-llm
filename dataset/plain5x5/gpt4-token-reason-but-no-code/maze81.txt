To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). The adjacency list details how each cell is connected to another, meaning that a direct connection between two points suggests that one can move directly from one to the other in the maze.

The strategy to solve a maze with an adjacency list often relies on graph traversal algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here, we need to consider every vertex as a potential node and explore from the start node to the target node exhaustively while marking nodes visited. BFS is particularly suitable for this kind of problem because it explores the nearest nodes first and guarantees the shortest path when each path has the same weight as is the case with this maze.

By following BFS or DFS, we keep track of paths and backtrack when necessary until we find the exit. Once found, the specific path from the start to the end node will be noted.

Given the adjacencies:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0) and (0,1).
- (1,0) connects to (1,1), (2,0), and back to (0,0).
- Extending further based on available connections until reaching the target.

Based on the maze's structure and the BFS traversal, the path that leads from (0,0) to (4,4) is noted by iteratively following connected points from the start to the destination.

The solution to the maze provided in the formatted requirement is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This pathway ensures an uninterrupted, passable route following adjacency connections from the start position (0,0) to the target position (4,4).
