The given adjacency list representation of the maze defines connections between each cell, outlining paths that can potentially be taken. In this model, each coordinate pair represents a cell in the maze, and each connection (notated by "<-->") represents an open path between these cells.

To determine the solution for finding the shortest path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (4,4), one effective method is Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This approach ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze, where each edge has the same weight.

### Steps Taken in BFS:
1. **Initiation**: Start from the entry point (0,0), and enqueues it. Mark it as visited.
2. **Exploration**: While there are nodes to process:
    - Dequeue the first node of the queue.
    - Check all its connected nodes (as per the adjacency list).
    - For each connected node that has not been visited and is not in the queue, mark it as visited, store its predecessor, and enqueue it.
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the exit point (4,4) is reached, reconstruct the path from (4,4) back to (0,0) using the stored predecessors.

### Using the adjacency list:
- Starting at (0,0), according to the adjacency list, the possible movements are to (1,0) and (0,1).
- Continue exploring each nodeâ€™s connections, ensuring to mark each visited node. This will help avoid revisiting cells and hence minimize the computation.
- Once (4,4) is encountered during BFS, trace back using predecessors to reconstruct the path.

### Conclusion:
The BFS algorithm is particularly suitable for this kind of problem due to its level-by-level expansion, which ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest possible path.

### Solution Found Using BFS:
1. Start from (0,0) and explore connected nodes.
2. Move step by step through connected nodes, ensuring to only progress through nodes that offer a potential pathway to the exit.
3. On reaching the exit coordinate (4,4), the path traversed is noted to be the shortest.

### Specific Shortest Path Solution:

Considering the maze structure provided in the adjacency list and imagining a BFS process executed, the shortest path traversed would be reconstructed here:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This results in a direct path moving mostly diagonally and horizontally across the grid, utilizing all available connections from the adjacency list to maintain the shortest route to the exit (4,4).
