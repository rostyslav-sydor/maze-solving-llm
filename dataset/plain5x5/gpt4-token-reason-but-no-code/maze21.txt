To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we begin by parsing the graph structure to identify how different points (nodes) are connected. We then need to find a path from the specified origin to the target points, which in this case goes from (0,0) to (4,4).

The graph indicates how each coordinate (node) in the maze is directly connected to another. We can employ a common pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which suits the adjacency list structure represented here.

Using BFS:
1. Begin at the origin node (0,0).
2. Explore all neighboring nodes that can be reached directly from the current node while ensuring we do not revisit any node.
3. Continue this exploration for each newly reached node, marking nodes as visited, and keep track of the path to each node.
4. Stop the search once the target node (4,4) is reached, retrieving the path taken to get there.

The BFS pathfinding approach efficiently allows us to reach from (0,0) to (4,4) while traversing the least number of edges (shortest path due to all edges being equal weight).

Applying this idea with the given graph connections, and following the shortest route from the entry to the exit while considering the maze pathways outlined in the adjacency list, the path solution to the maze from (0,0) to (4,4) is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path moves optimally through available connections towards the goal without unnecessary detours, as determined by the BFS method for managing nodes and their links in the adjacency list.
