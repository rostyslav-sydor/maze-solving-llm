The problem here involves finding a path through a maze represented as a graph. The maze is provided in an adjacency list format where each pair of connected nodes (coordinates in this context) is listed. The goal is to move from the origin (start point) (0,0) to the target (end point) (4,4).

The strategy to solve this is to use a graph traversal algorithm. Breadth-first search (BFS) is particularly suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one. BFS systematically explores the maze, level by level, ensuring that once it reaches the target, it has found the shortest possible path. The use of a queue in BFS ensures we explore nodes in the order they are discovered, which is useful for finding paths in mazes.

Using BFS, we start at the origin and explore all directly connected nodes, adding them to a queue. Each node keeps track of its predecessor to reconstruct the path once the target is reached. This is repeated for each node taken from the queue until the target is reached. Each connection between nodes (passages between maze cells) corresponds to taking a step in one of the four cardinal directions unless obstructed by a wall.

Following the adjacency list provided and applying BFS, the solution (shortest path) for the maze from (0,0) to (4,4) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

To summarize, the solution is obtained by carefully tracking every node visited from the origin and systematically exploring all possible paths using the BFS strategy, ensuring not to revisit nodes to avoid loops. Each step in the found path corresponds to navigation decisions that could be made in a physical maze or decisions in a routing algorithm based on the connections specified in the adjacency list. The BFS guarantees the identified path is among the shortest possible given the structure of the maze, respecting all walls and passages.
