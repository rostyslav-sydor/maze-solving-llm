To find the solution for the maze described in the adjacency list, we first need to decode the passages of the maze. The maze's structure is represented as connections between adjacent cells, each identified by a coordinate pair. The entry point is marked at (0,0) and the exit point at (4,4). The aim is to find a path from the entry to the exit, moving through connected nodes.

I'll breakdown and analyze the connections given in the adjacency list to map out the maze:

- From (0,0), one can move to (0,1). From (0,1) further moves to (0,2) are possible, then to (0,3), and finally to (0,4) which also connects to (1,4).
- Similarly observing other connections, we progress by finding which cells are connected and can lead towards our target from the last available nodes.

By progressively following paths available from one cell to the next while avoiding loops and dead ends, we aim to find a path leading from the origin to the target.

Now, I will specifically outline the exact path taken from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4) by analyzing directly connected paths:
1. Start at (0,0), travel to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) to (0,4).
5. From (0,4) to (1,4).
6. From (1,4) through a number of viz (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3).
7. From (4,3) directly to (4,4), which is the target.

Path from (0,0) to (4,4):
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

These moves involve a careful selection of connected nodes, providing a continuous route from the origin to the target without backtracking or hitting dead ends, given the connections stated in the maze's adjacency list structure.
