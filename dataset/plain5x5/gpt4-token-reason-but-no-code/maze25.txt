To find a path through the given adjacency list that represents a maze, we need to interpret the connections between nodes (each node representing a coordinate) and use a search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path between the start (origin) and finish (target) points.

The adjacency list gives us direct connectivities between various points in the maze:
- Each tuple pair like `(x, y) <--> (a, b)` indicates that you can directly move between coordinate `(x, y)` and `(a, b)`.

Given the start point `(0,0)` and the target point `(4,4)`, we need to search through these connectivities to find a way from the origin to the target.

By interpreting the adjacency list and manually or algorithmically following potential paths using steps delineated by the graph edges (connections between nodes), we start at `(0,0)` and attempt to reach `(4,4)`.

A feasible solution path for this maze, based on the provided adjacency list and using intuitive traversal (such as BFS to ensure we explore all possible paths uniformly), reveals the following sequence of moves:

- Starting from `(0,0)`, the possible movement is to `(1,0)`, following the adjacency `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`.
- From `(1,0)`, the path can proceed to `(2,0)` via `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`.
- Move from `(2,0)` to `(3,0)` using the connection `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`.
- Continue from `(3,0)` to `(4,0)` based on the adjacency `(4,0) <--> (3,0)`, then thus approaching closer to the destination.
- From `(4,0)`, a direct traversal is not possible to `(4,4)`. Hence, moving sequentially through `(4,1)` via `(4,0) <--> (4,1)`, then to `(4,2)` using `(4,2) <--> (4,1)`, following up with `(4,3)` via `(4,3) <--> (4,2)`, and finally reaching `(4,4)` from `(4,3)` as per `(4,4) <--> (4,3)`.

Thus, the complete path in the specified solution format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This approach ensures a clear path from the origin to the target utilizing the available direct connections, and it covers the simplest route given the constraints of the adjacency list.
