To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). We will utilize a graph traversal algorithm (BFS or DFS) to explore the nodes and find the shortest path.

From the given adjacency list, it appears the maze is represented as a grid, where each pair (i,j) represents a cell and the adjacencies show which cells are directly connected. This can be imagined like corridors between rooms or open pathways in a traditional maze.

1. Start by parsing the adjacency list into a usable format (create a graph in memory).
2. Set the origin point as (0,0) and the target as (4,4) based on the tokens provided.
3. Use a graph searching algorithm (like Breadth-first search, BFS, for shortest path):
    - Enqueue the start point.
    - Keep exploring nodes by dequeuing the current position and enqueuing its neighbors if they haven't been visited.
    - Record the path taken to reach each node.
    - Once the target node (4,4) is reached, backtrack using the recorded paths to obtain the route from start to target.
4. Output the path.

The graph traversal will effectively navigate between the coordinates, inspecting each possible node until it locates the destination (4,4). Since the BFS algorithm inspects the nearest nodes first and only explores farther ones when all nearer possibilities are exhausted, it ensures the path found is one of the shortest.

Given the provided adjacency list, implementing BFS would result in the discovery of the shortest path from the origin to the exit as described through the possible paths dictated by direct adjacencies (like moving through an open door into an adjacent room).

After applying the above method to the specific maze given, the solution path from (0,0) to (4,4) in the format specified is the following:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
