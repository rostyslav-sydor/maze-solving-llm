Given the adjacency list of a maze and the specific start (0,0) and end (4,4) points, we need to trace a path through the maze that connects these points. Let's understand the graph representation and utilize it to determine a possible route from the start to the end coordinate.

We'll tackle this via a thought process resembling a backtracking or breadth-first search method which is typical for solving graph traversal and maze-related problems. The adjacency list represents pairs of directly connected coordinates in the maze:

- Given the starting point (0,0), we see from the adjacency list that (0,0) has connections to (0,1) and (1,0).
- We can explore these paths and trace further connections from each reachable coordinate.
  
Following this approach iteratively for all accessible coordinates:

1. From (0,0) move to (1,0) (as it's one of the accessible points).
2. From (1,0), continue to other accessible coordinates: move to (1,1) next.
3. From (1,1), move to (1,2). 
4. From (1,2), you can either go to (0,2) or follow to (2,2), moving deeper into the maze.
5. From (2,2), continue the path to (3,2) and then extending further to (4,2), connecting to (4,3) and finally (4,4) which is the target.

This logical sequence covers checking adjacent cells from the list, deciding based on connectivity and ensuring that the chosen path is moving towards the goal directly or indirectly. The chosen set of movements maintains a path covering all vital coordinates mentioned in the adjacency connections, and ensures every step is valid and leads closer to the exit.

Given this thinking process, the solution to traverse through this maze using the adjacency list provided would be encapsulated as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
