To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, we will perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the origin (entry point) to the target (exit point). BFS is chosen because it is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, and every edge in the maze is effectively the same "weight" (each move from one point to another is one step).

The adjacency list presented describes all the possible direct connections between the coordinates in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (4,4). 

Starting from (0,0) with BFS, we will explore all accessible points and trace the path by maintaining a record of each point's predecessor. Once we reach the target point (4,4), we can backtrack from this point using the predecessor record to construct the path taken.

**Step-by-Step BFS Process:**
1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all directly connected neighbors.
3. From each neighbor, explore their adjacent points that have not yet been visited, marking each pointâ€™s predecessor.
4. Repeat until the target is reached.

**Building the Path:**
Once the target (4,4) is found:
- Backtrack using the recorded predecessors, building the path list from the target to the origin.
- Reverse this list to get the correct order from origin to target.

Given the specified adjacency list and applying BFS would result in the following path (assuming correct BFS traversal and predecessor tracking):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This path is one of the possible shortest solutions out of potentially multiple correct solutions, depending on the order of neighbor exploration in BFS. This particular path was generated by systematically selecting the next unvisited neighbor coordinates moving toward the target in a general southeast direction where possible.
