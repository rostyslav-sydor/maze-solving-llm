The given maze is represented as an adjacency list, where each line specifies two points that are directly connected. The objective is to find a path from the specified origin (0,0) to the target (4,4).

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the adjacency list to determine possible moves at each step and trace a route from the start to the finishing point. In mazes or graphs, a common strategy to find a path between two points is using Breadth-First Search (BFS). This algorithm is particularly suited to finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze, as it explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here's how you could think about solving the maze using BFS, adjusted for a clear explanation of the solution without involving actual code:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. From (0,0), two pathways are obtained from the adjacency list: (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Move to (0,1), then check for next moves: (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4. Continue this pattern, examining adjacent nodes and exploring further pathways (e.g., from (0,2) move to (0,3), then to (1,3) through multiple options present).
5. The aim is to keep track of visited points to avoid cycles or retracing the same path, ensuring that the search moves towards the target efficiently.
6. Continue until the current node or position matches the target node (4,4).

Using this reasoning and the adjacency list provided, the path from (0,0) to (4,4) is deduced as follows:

1. Starting at (0,0), you can move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) you can proceed to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move sequentially to (1,4), then from (1,4) step to (2,4).
6. Move from (2,4) to (3,4), and lastly from (3,4) to (4,4).

Therefore, the path can be described as the coordinate sequence:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This output represents the shortest path traversing through the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (4,4), according to the connections defined in the adjacency list and reasoned using a conceptual approach similar to a BFS strategy.
