To solve the maze outlined in the query, we need to find a path from the `origin` point `(0,0)` to the `target` point `(4,4)` using the adjacency list provided.

First, let's interpret the adjacency list to deduce the connections between the points:
- `(2,0)` connects to `(1,0)`.
- `(3,0)` connects to `(2,0)`.
- `(4,3)` connects to `(4,2)` and `(4,4)`.
- `(4,0)` connects to `(3,0)` and `(4,1)`.
- `(3,2)` connects to `(2,2)` and `(3,3)`.
- `(0,0)` connects to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
- `(0,4)` connects to `(1,4)`.
- `(2,4)` connects to `(1,4)` and `(2,3)`.
- `(3,4)` connects to `(4,4)`.
- `(2,2)` connects to `(2,3)`, `(1,2)`.
- `(1,3)` connects to `(0,3)` and `(1,4)`.
- `(3,3)` connects to `(4,3)`.
- `(0,3)` connects to `(0,2)`.
- `(4,0)` connects directly to `(4,1)`.
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`.
- `(1,1)` connects to `(2,1)`.
- `(3,1)` connects to `(4,1)` and `(2,1)`.

From the outlined connections, we'll utilize breadth-first search (BFS), which is a reliable method for finding the shortest path in such puzzles. The BFS method starts at the initial node (origin) and explores all neighboring nodes first, before moving to next level neighbors. This ensures that once the target node is reached, we necessarily find the shortest route.

Now, applying the BFS method given the adjacency graph:
1. Start at `(0,0)`, explore neighbors `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. From `(1,0)`, move to `(2,0)`. From `(0,1)`, explore `(0,0)` (back to start) and `(0,2)`.
3. Keep expanding: `(2,0)` to `(3,0)`, `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`.
4. Further expand: `(3,0)` to `(4,0)`, `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(4,0)` explore `(4,1)`. From `(1,3)` to `(1,4)`.
6. Continue to `(4,1)` to `(3,1)`. From `(1,4)` to `(2,4)`.
7. Explore next levels sequentially until reaching `(4,4)`.

Through the BFS, we have the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path connects the origin to the target following valid adjacency moves, ensuring the movement from the start `(0,0)` to the goal `(4,4)` through the network nodes available, proving its efficacy based on the BFS methodology applied to the adjacency list provided.
