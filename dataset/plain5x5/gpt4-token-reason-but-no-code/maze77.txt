To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we need to find a path between the origin (0,0) and the target (4,4) using the connections between cells.

From the adjacency list, each pair of connected cells can be considered as an edge in an undirected graph. The goal is to traverse this graph from the origin to the target.

Considering the given maze, a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable since it will ensure the shortest path is identified if it exists, by exploring the closest (in terms of number of steps) nodes first before moving on to more distant ones.

Starting at the origin (0,0), explore all directly connected cells, then explore the cells connected to those cells, and so on, until the target is reached or all possible paths are explored.

Following is the solution path generated using such an approach, where cells connected directly by adjacency from the list are traversed in an efficient manner to reach the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Explanation of the path:
- Starting from (0,0), a movement is made upwards towards the target using available direct connections.
- Navigate vertically up through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4), as these are connected sequentially.
- Continue from (0,4) to (1,4) and then from (1,4) to (2,4), connecting vertically through the columns.
- The path continues vertically through (3,4) and finally reaches the target at (4,4).

This path represents a clear route from the starting point to the destination using the connections specified in the adjacency list, visiting each contiguous cell along the way. It ensures all movements are legal and directly follow the connections described in the maze configuration.
