To solve this maze, we can utilize a graph traversal approach, specifically the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method. BFS is ideal for this situation because it explores all possible paths layer by layer, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target, it is through the shortest possible route. The adjacency list provided defines how the nodes (i.e., points or coordinates in the maze) are connected, making BFS a straightforward method to apply.

First, the maze is defined as an undirected graph where each coordinate pair represents a node and each connection (or edge) represents a direct walkable passage between the nodes.

### Steps to solve the maze:
1. **Initialize**: Start from the origin node `(0,0)` and aim to reach the target node `(4,4)`.
2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to manage nodes to explore.
   - Start with the origin node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.
   - For each node dequeued, explore its neighbors (connected nodes). If a neighbor is the target node, the path has been found.
   - If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it, also keeping track of the path that led to this neighbor.
   - Repeat until the queue is empty or the target is found.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Once reaching the target, trace back from the target node to the origin node utilizing the path records to construct the sequence of moves that led to the solution.

### The Analysis:
Applying BFS ensures that all shortest paths are examined first. Since each coordinate can connect directly to its neighbors (up, down, left, right), the BFS will effectively find the shortest path from the origin to the target based on the direct connections provided in the adjacency list. The BFS process also avoids cycles and retracing by marking nodes as visited.

### Solution:
Having simulated the BFS traversal based on the adjacency list given and consistently tracking paths while moving from node to node, we trace the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`, compiled as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents the sequence of moves in the maze from the starting point (bottom-left) to the exit point (top-right) using the connections described in the provided list. The traversal carefully avoids backtracking and ensures every move is towards unvisited sections, optimizing the path to the exit.
