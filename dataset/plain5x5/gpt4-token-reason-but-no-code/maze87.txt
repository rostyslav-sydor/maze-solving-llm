To solve the maze given by the adjacency list, I'll first parse the adjacency information to understand the connectivity between different cells of the maze. The maze can be considered as a graph where each cell (node) is connected to one or more neighboring cells (nodes) if there exists a direct path between them.

From the provided adjacency list, the starting point (entry) is (0,0) and the target (exit) is (4,4). The goal is to find a path in the graph from the origin to the target. A common approach to finding such a path in a maze or graph is using a breadth-first search (BFS), which explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is suitable here as it also finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, ensuring the most direct route through the maze.

BFS starts at the source node, then explores all adjacent nodes in a systematic way according to the level of each node, gradually progressing outward. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore, and a set or dictionary to mark the nodes that have been visited to prevent revisiting them and to prevent cycles.

By following BFS:
1. Initialize the queue with the starting point.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front cell. If it's the target, backtrack using a predecessor map (parents) to find the path and stop searching.
3. For the current cell, enqueue all its unvisited adjacent cells, mark them as visited, and record their predecessor.
4. Repeat until the queue is empty or the target is found.

Upon implementing this strategy on the adjacency list, I'll trace through the graph from (0,0) to (4,4). Using BFS, I will insert all neighbors of the current cell in the order they appear in the adjacency list.

Let me process the BFS based on the adjacency list interpretation and backtracking logic to obtain the path:

Here's the solution path determined by following the BFS and backtracking from the target (4,4) to the origin (0,0) using the predecessor information recorded during the BFS search:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents a BFS traversal from the entry to the exit in the maze, ensuring an efficient route through the available connections in the adjacency list.
