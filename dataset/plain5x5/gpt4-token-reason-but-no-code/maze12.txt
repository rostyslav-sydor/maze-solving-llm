To solve the maze, we start from the designated origin (0,0) and aim to reach the target (4,4) using the connections represented in the adjacency list. The approach involves navigating through the maze by following the edges between connected nodes until we find a path from the origin to the target.

From the adjacency list, we can ascertain the possible moves at each step by tracing the connections between nodes. The goal is to find a continuous path that does not revisit any node unnecessarily and finally reaches the target node.

Starting at (0,0), we can use the adjacency list to explore the neighboring nodes, looking for a direct path or a series of moves to (4,4):

1. From (0,0) we can move to (0,1) since they are directly connected.
2. From (0,1) we proceed to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) we move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) the next step is (0,4).
5. From (0,4), go to (1,4).
6. From (1,4), step to (2,4).
7. From (2,4), move to (3,4).
8. Finally, from (3,4) proceed to (4,4) which is our target.

This path directly follows the connections provided in the adjacency list for a feasible solution, ensuring every move is legal according to the adjacency relations provided.

Thus, the solution path for the maze from point (0,0) to (4,4) in the specified format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
