To solve the maze described by the adjacency list provided, we need to identify a path from the entry point at $(0,0)$ to the exit point at $(4,4)$ through the connections listed within the adjacency list. This graph represents a set of direct connections between grid points of the maze, and we can think of these connections as edges in a graph where the grid points are vertices.

To find the solution:
1. **Graph Representation**: First, represent the maze as a graph in memory, using a structure like a dictionary where keys are coordinate tuples and values are lists of tuples representing adjacent vertices (i.e., directly reachable coordinates).
   
2. **Breadth-First Search** (BFS): This algorithm is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (or maze). Start at the origin coordinate $(0,0)$ and explore all its neighbors, then all of their neighbors, and so on, until the target $(4,4)$ is reached. BFS is advantageous here as it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

3. **Path Construction**: As BFS proceeds, track the path to each node. This is often done by remembering the predecessor of each visited node. Once the target node is reached, backtrace from the target node to the origin using these predecessor links to extract the path.

**Specific solution based on the adjacency list**:
The graph is defined with edges as described in the list (e.g., $(3,4) <--> (4,4)$ means $(3,4)$ is connected to $(4,4)$, and so on). Starting at $(0,0)$, I perform BFS to explore each level:

- From $(0,0)$, directly reachable: $(1,0)$ and continue this method until all reachable nodes from each node are explored.
- Checking each nodeâ€™s neighbors in the given adjacency list until reaching $(4,4)$.

After sorting through BFS and making our way through the adjacency connections, assembling the correct path from $(0,0)$ to $(4,4)$:

**Final path**:
- Start at $(0,0)$.
- Move to $(1,0)$ as it's directly connected.
- From $(1,0)$ to $(1,1)$, and then to $(1,2)$.
- From $(1,2)$ directly move vertically to $(2,2)$ and then to $(2,3)$.
- Move from $(2,3)$ to $(3,3)$ and then vertically up to $(3,4)$.
- Finally, transition from $(3,4)$ to $(4,4)$ which is the exit.

Each step follows only the adjacency connections provided, thus ensuring a valid path. Here's the explicit path output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This route adheres strictly to the listed connections and accomplishes the goal of moving from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
