In the provided maze configuration, the challenge is to find a feasible path from the specified origin (0,0) to the designated target (4,4). This maze is a graph-based structure where each node is a coordinate point, and edges exist where paths are directly connected. As noted, the maze is not a grid of perfectly connected paths but rather has specific connections.

The task is essentially a problem of pathfinding in a graph, commonly tackled using algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs like this one, where the shortest path is required. BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Therefore, it systematically checks all possible paths from the origin and can guarantee finding the shortest path to the target if one exists.

Given the description of the maze:
- We can construct the graph using the adjacency list provided.
- We would then apply BFS starting from the origin (0,0), exploring all possible paths.
- The BFS keeps track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and inefficiencies.
- As BFS finds the target (4,4), we trace back our way from the target node to the origin node using the recorded path information.

For this scenario, following BFS through the adjacency list results in finding the shortest path, taken step by step through traversable connections. Given the nature and connections of the graph, here's what the solution would look like:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path has sequentially explored the connections between the coordinates given in the adjacency list, moving from the origin to the target while passing through each linked node. The aim was to move generally towards the goal while following existing paths, leading to the discovery of the shortest route in the graph presented.
