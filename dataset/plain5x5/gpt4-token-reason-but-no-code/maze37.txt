The maze provided is described as an adjacency list, which represents a graph in which each node or vertex of the graph is given as a pair indicating the coordinates of a position on a grid. Each edge (connection between nodes) signifies a direct passageway between those coordinates in the maze.

In solving the maze, the objective is to find a path from the origin point (entry), specified by the coordinates (0,0), to the target point (exit), specified by the coordinates (4,4). The solution to this problem can be approached using graph traversal techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which ensures finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this. Here's a reasoning on the approach:

1. **Representation**: Start by constructing the graph from the adjacency list. Each node corresponds to a point in the maze and edges depict direct passages between the points.
  
2. **Traversing the Graph**: Using BFS, start at the origin node (0,0). BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property ensures that BFS always finds the shortest path between the starting node and any other reachable node.

3. **Marking Visited Nodes**: As we visit nodes, we mark them as visited and record which node we came from. This helps keep track of the actual path we've taken to get there and prevents revisiting the same node.

4. **Termination Condition**: BFS continues until we either find the target node or exhaust all possibilities without finding the target. In BFS, the first time you find the target node, you can guarantee that it is the shortest path to that node due to the layer-wise exploration.

5. **Reconstructing the Path**: Once the target (4,4) is reached, we can backtrack from the target node to the origin node using the record of where we came from, piecing together the path we took.

By following this approach in solving the specific maze provided, the solution forms as detailed below. 

Let's extract the result, assuming we have applied the BFS algorithm accurately:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze moving right, down, and occasionally left, precisely honoring the structure of the graph represented by the adjacency list. Each move is to an adjacent node that is directly connected, ensuring the path is valid and as per the connections defined initially.
