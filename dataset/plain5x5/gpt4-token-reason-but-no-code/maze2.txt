To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, the challenge is to find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(4,4)` using the connections provided.

Firstly, we construct a graph from the adjacency list:
- Each pair separated by `<-->` shows a bidirectional connection between two points in the maze.
- Nodes represent coordinates in a grid, and edges represent permissible movement between these nodes.

Using any pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or A* (A-star), we can trace a path from the origin to the target:
- **BFS** would typically be used for unweighted graphs like this, as it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed. It explores neighbors level-by-level ensuring the shortest path is found for unweighted graphs.
- **DFS** can be used but might not guarantee the shortest path, as it dives deep into one direction first before backtracking.
- **A-star**, effective with heuristics to guide pathfinding, usually helps in weighted graphs or when an estimation to the target can enhance searching.

For simplicity, if a BFS is utilized:
1. Start at the origin node `(0,0)`.
2. Explore all directly connected nodes.
3. For each node explored, go to their connected nodes until the target `(4,4)` is reached, ensuring not to re-visit nodes.

From the provided adjacency list, by plotting each connection and then applying BFS, one possible shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` could be traced as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates is reached by following the nodes from the origin to the target, using the connections given in the adjacency list, ensuring that each move is valid and progressively heading towards the exit. This is one of the possible paths, considering there could be other routes that also lead to the destination, depending on the order of exploration of nodes in the BFS process.
