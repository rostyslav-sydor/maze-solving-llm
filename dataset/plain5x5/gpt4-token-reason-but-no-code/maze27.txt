To solve the maze given as an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). Here, each pair represents a coordinate in a grid-based layout, and each pair in the adjacency list represents a direct, two-directional connection (path) between two nodes.

Using the given adjacency list representation, we understand the possible movements in the maze from each coordinate. We can either use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible paths from the starting coordinate (0,0) and identify one that leads to the target coordinate (4,4). BFS is generally preferred in maze-solving scenarios because it finds the shortest path when unweighted edges are used, which seems to be our case as there is no specific weight associated with moving from one node to another.

Following BFS from the start node (0,0), we explore its connected nodes, and from those nodes, their connected nodes, until we reach the target (4,4). It's crucial to mark nodes as visited as we advance to prevent re-processing and getting stuck in cycles.

From the practical execution using the BFS algorithm for this specific maze's adjacency list, the solution path is identified. Here's the solution path visualized, starting from (0,0) and aiming for (4,4):

1. Begin at (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1) as per the edge (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Move to (0,2) through the edge (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4. Continue to (1,2) through the edge (1,2) <--> (0,2).
5. Then to (1,3) due to the edge (1,2) <--> (1,3).
6. Move next to (1,4) via the edge (1,4) <--> (1,3).
7. Head to (2,4) with the edge (2,4) <--> (1,4).
8. Continue to (3,4) because of (3,4) <--> (2,4).
9. Finally reach (4,4) by the edge (4,4) <--> (3,4).

So, the completed path from (0,0) to (4,4) is presented in the correct format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This solution provides a clear route from the origin to the target within the maze based on the specified adjacency list.
