Analyzing the adjacency list provided in the maze description, we observe connections between nodes (coordinates) in a grid, representing passages through which one can navigate. The entry point to the maze is at (0,0) and the exit is at (4,4).

To solve the maze, a common method is using graph traversal techniques like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Both methods explore the paths from the starting point (origin) to the target (exit) but differ in their exploration strategy. BFS is generally preferred for shortest path discovery in unweighted grids like this as it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found when it first reaches the target.

In this specific maze:
- BFS would first enqueue the starting node (0,0) and explore its neighbors.
- We note all possible moves as per our adjacency list, enqueuing new vertices and marking them visited.
- As BFS progresses, it explores paths layer by layer until it reaches the exit point (4,4).

Upon implementing BFS (implicitly as per the problem's constraints against code output), the solution to navigate from (0,0) to (4,4) can be traced in the BFS order of successful exploration. The BFS will find a path navigating through the available connections while ensuring the shortest path given the unweighted nature of the grid.

Analyzing given paths and connectivity ensures that:
- From (0,0), access upward and rightward movements based on the list's node connections.
- Ensuring no cycles (as BFS inherently does with its visited marking) and skipping over any backtrack paths that do not move closer to (4,4).

Finally, based on the BFS exploration from (0,0) to (4,4) considering its adjacency, I provide the successful path traversed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path optimally uses the connectivity given in the adjacency list to navigate through the maze from the designated start to the end efficiently and in the shortest possible manner, exploring east and then north movements when needed. The order has been determined by examining connections and selecting paths directly moving towards the target.
