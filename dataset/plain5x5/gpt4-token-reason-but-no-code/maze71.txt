Given the maze provided via an adjacency list format, the task is to determine a solution path from the marked entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(4,4)` using the connections specified. We construct the graph from the adjacency list, then perform a search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). These algorithms are ideal for exploring all possible paths because of their systematic way of examining every possible node and edge in the graph. BFS is particularly effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze.

Using the adjacency list, I'll construct an effective graph representation then run BFS starting from `(0,0)` and will stop once `(4,4)` is reached. The process involves exploring each node's neighbors, queued in a manner that ensures we explore each layer of nodes completely before moving to the next layer. BFS guarantees that we find the shortest path if one exists due to its layer-wise exploration strategy.

Here is the solution in the specific format after conducting the BFS:

**<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>**

This series of coordinates represents each move in the maze from start to finish along the shortest path identified, showcasing each grid position visited once in sequence from the entry to the exit point.
