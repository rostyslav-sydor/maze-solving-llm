The provided maze is represented as an adjacency list, linking different coordinate points via passages. To find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4), we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is apt for this purpose as it explores neighbors level by level and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this maze.

Given the adjacency list:

- Parse the adjacencies to understand which nodes (coordinates) are connected directly.
- Apply BFS beginning from the start coordinate (0,0), pushing each accessible node into a queue and marking it as visited.
- For each node processed, check for its neighbors; if a neighbor is the target node (4,4) then the path is complete.
- If not, continue by marking new neighbors as visited and pushing them into the queue with a reference to the prior node, allowing to trace the path once the exit is reached.
  
Following this approach for the maze provided leads to an exploration of possible paths looking for connections, starting from (0,0) and hoping to reach (4,4). Nodes are checked based on their connections from the starting node through potential paths found in the adjacency list, stepping through permissible passages until the destination is reached.

Upon applying this BFS method to the maze and recording the path from start to target:

- Start at (0,0), traverse to connected nodes.
- From (0,0) you can go to (1,0).
- From (1,0), move along to (1,1), then to (1,2), ascending to (1,3) which connects to (1,4).
- At (1,4), the passage available is to (2,4), then reach (3,4).
- Finally, from (3,4), move directly to (4,4) which is our target.

Therefore, the shortest solution path for the maze provided is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>.
