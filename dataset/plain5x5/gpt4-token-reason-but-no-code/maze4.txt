In the given problem, we are provided with a graph that represents a maze, with directed paths noted as edges between nodes, and needing to determine a solution path from an entry point to an exit point.

To solve this problem:
1. **Adjacency List Parsing**: First, the graph's adjacency list is translated into a usable structure, typically a dictionary where each node (a coordinate) maps to a list of directly reachable coordinates.

2. **Entry and Exit Points Deemed**: Identifying the precise points to start and end (denoted in the text as `(0,0)` for start and `(4,4)` for end). 

3. **Graph Traversal**: We can use Breadth First Search (BFS), a suitable graph traversal approach for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Initially, we mark the start coordinate and begin exploring all directly connected neighbors. Then, neighbors of those neighbors continue until we reach the goal. As BFS explores layer by layer, when it first encounters the target node, it guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted setting like this maze.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Upon reaching the target node, we trace back from this node to the source node using a previously maintained parent or predecessor map. This map gets populated during the BFS traversal, noting for each node which node it was discovered from.

**Solution Steps:**
- Parse the adjacency list and prepare the map of connections.
- Use BFS starting from `(0,0)`, queuing each explored node and its predecessor.
- Upon reaching `(4,4)`, backtrack using the predecessor chain to construct the path.

**Specifically, applying these steps to this maze:**

Upon analyzing the traversal steps and following the BFS exploration:
1. We start from `(0,0)`, then explore its neighbors `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. From `(1,0)`, nodes `(2,0)` and `(1,1)` are accessible, and from `(0,1)` nodes `(0,0)`, `(0,2)` are accessible.
3. Continue BFS until reaching node `(4,4)`.

When the BFS traversal concludes after hitting `(4,4)`, the predecessor map allows retracing the actual path taken, constructing the step-by-step route (from entry to exit).

The actual path found based on BFS and tracking the node exploration:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>`

This pathway represents a direct solution to the presented maze using BFS for shortest path exploration and path reconstruction to list the steps explicitly.
