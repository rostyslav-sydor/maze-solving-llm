To find a solution path through the maze specified in the adjacency list, we first interpret the adjacency list to understand how the maze's cells (given as coordinate pairs) are interconnected. Then, we determine the shortest route from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(4,4)` using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is ideal for this case as it explores all possible paths layer by layer, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target, it does so via the shortest possible path.

Here is a breakdown of the thought process:

1. **Parse the adjacency list** to create a graph representation. Elements like `(1,0) <--> (0,0)` in the list indicate direct connections or passable pathways between the points in the maze.

2. **Setup the BFS**:
   - Start BFS from the origin coordinate `(0,0)`.
   - Use a queue to handle the nodes being explored.
   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid re-processing them.
   - Store the path taken using a dictionary that maps each node back to its predecessor.

3. **Explore the graph**:
   - Dequeue the current node from the queue.
   - For each adjacent node (connected directly by an edge), if not yet visited, mark it as visited, record its predecessor, and enqueue it.
   - Repeat until the queue is empty or the target `(4,4)` is dequeed, indicating the shortest path has been found.

4. **Reconstruct the path**:
   - Once the BFS reaches `(4,4)`, backtrack from this node using the predecessor mapping to reconstruct the path from the origin to the target.

5. **Output the path** from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` in the format as specified.

Given that BFS will ensure the shortest path is found given it explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next depth level, and considering the connections in the maze, the calculated path using this reasoning would be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path moves optimally from the entry to the exit, maintaining a generally direct route while adapting to the available pathways as dictated by the maze's connections.
