To solve the maze, we process the adjacency list representing the maze into a usable form, then apply a search algorithm. With the given adjacency list, the maze can essentially be viewed as a graph where nodes are points (coordinates) and edges indicate paths between them. A search algorithm would traverse this graph from an entry point (origin) to an exit point (target).

**Steps for solving the maze:**
1. Parse the adjacency list into a graph structure where each node (coordinate point) lists its directly connected points.
2. Employ a graph traversal/search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the origin point to find the target point. These algorithms are suitable as they can systematically explore the graph and identify the shortest path in cases like BFS.
3. Capture the path taken from the origin to the target as the successful route through the maze.

**Reasoning Behind Using BFS:**
BFS explores the nearest nodes first before moving on to the next level of nodes, which ensures when the target is reached, it's by the shortest path available in an unweighted graph like this one. This is particularly beneficial in a maze context to find the quickest route out.

Below is the derived solution for this specific maze using BFS (as it's most suitable for its level-wise exploration guaranteeing shortest path discovery):

**Solution:**
- Start the BFS from the origin point, (0,0).
- Explore neighbors and keep a record of visited nodes and previous nodes (for path reconstruction).
- Continue the exploration until the target point, (4,4) is reached.
- Reconstruct the path from (4,4) back to (0,0) using the recorded breadcrumbs of previous nodes to trace the direct route taken.

Here is the detailed path from (0,0) to (4,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path directly follows a logical and short progression through the maze from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, traversing minimal nodes and using the available connections as per the adjacency list provided. By starting from the origin and making near-straight-line advancements towards the target, following the paths connected on the graph, it represents an efficient route that is typical of the solutions provided by traversal algorithms like BFS.
