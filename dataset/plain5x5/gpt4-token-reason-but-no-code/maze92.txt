The maze is defined as a graph where each cell is a node, and connections (edges) between nodes represent pathways that can be traversed in the maze. Given the described adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4).

The adjacency list presents the connections directly between nodes; hence, a solution involves navigating these connections to move from the start to the target node, documenting each step.

In solving this maze:
1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Identify reachable nodes directly connected to current node and choose paths leading towards the target (favor directions reducing the distance to the target node).
3. Continue selecting pathways in each step based on available routes until reaching the target node.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Starting from (0,0), you can proceed to (1,0) or (0,1).
- Evaluating options, moving vertically might progress you towards the bottom row faster, hence choose (1,0).
- From (1,0), move to (2,0).
- From (2,0), continue to (3,1) as it pulls you diagonally towards (4,4).
- (3,1) connects to (2,1) and then to (2,2).
- From (2,2) best step is moving to (1,2), and then to (1,3).
- From (1,3), navigate to (2,3) and then (3,3), putting you closer to (4,4).
- From (3,3), go to (3,4).
- From (3,4), go to (4,4), which is the target.

Arriving at the exit point through this sequence ensures every move was efficient in terms of bringing you closer to the target or at least shifting you in necessary axes (rows or columns).

This pathway captures a direct route staying as linear as possible to the end goal without unnecessary diversions. Importantly, each step ensures no node is revisited, thus eliminating cycles and ensuring an efficient path.

Thus, the solution to this maze based on the input adjacency list and defined start and end points is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
