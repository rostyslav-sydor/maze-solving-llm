In the provided maze, each pair of coordinates within "<ADJLIST_START>" and "<ADJLIST_END>" highlights pathways that connect two specific points in the maze. To find a path from the origin to the target, we need to ensure we traverse these pathways in such a way that helps us move from the start (origin) to the end (target) without backtracking unnecessarily.

The origin point is (0,0) and the target point is (4,4), as specified between "<ORIGIN_START>,<ORIGIN_END>" and "<TARGET_START>,<TARGET_END>" tokens respectively. 

To solve the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS). Here's a concise reasoning based on these strategies:

1. Starting from (0,0), we look for all directly connected paths.
2. For each connected node, we continue this process recursively or iteratively by keeping track of visited nodes, ensuring not to visit any node more than once to avoid cycles.
3. We continue this traversal until we either find the target node (4,4) or exhaust all possible paths without finding the target.

Using this approach allows exploring the structure defined by the adjacency list while ensuring the path advances toward the goal. 

Let's trace a path through this specified maze:

- Start at the origin (0,0), which connects directly to (0,1).
- From (0,1) we can move to adjacent nodes (1,1) or (0,2).
- Proceeding from (0,2), we can move to (0,3).
- From (0,3), we can move to (1,3).
- At (1,3), we can continue to (1,4).
- From (1,4), it connects to both (2,4) and (0,4), but to move closer to the target (4,4), going to (2,4) is logical.
- Moving on from (2,4), we can directly shift to (2,3).
- From (2,3), head to (3,3).
- From (3,3) we can progress to (4,3).
- And from (4,3), finally, we can step directly to the target (4,4).

Each step in the sequence brings us closer to our ultimate destination following adjacent paths as defined. Thus, the pathway unfolded:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path effectively demonstrates all decisions considered based on adjacency and striving towards minimal backtracking in reaching the endpoint.
