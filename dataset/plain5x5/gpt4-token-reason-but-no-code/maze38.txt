To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, we first interpret the structure. Each edge in the adjacency list represents a passageway in the maze between two points, and the challenge is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4).

In analyzing the maze:

1. We start at the origin (0,0).
2. The adjacency list is converted into a graph structure to understand how each position in the maze connects.
3. Using a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), we explore the maze. In mazes, BFS is generally preferred because it finds the shortest path when all edges have equal weight, while DFS is typically simpler but does not guarantee the shortest path.

From position (0,0), checking the adjacency list, we can progress to (0,1). Here's the reasoning and pathway to get to (4,4):

- Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1) as it directly connects.
- From (0,1), move to (0,2), then to (0,3).
- From (0,3), there are connections to (1,3) and (0,4).
- Progress to (1,3) from (0,3), as this direction leads directly toward our eventual target on the grid.
- From (1,3), move to (1,2) and then (1,1).
- From (1,1), move to (2,1), which connects further to other coordinates leading to the target.
- From (2,1), move to (2,2), then to (2,3) directly moving upward in that column, use (3,3) from (2,3).
- Progress to (3,2), then to (3,1) followed by (4,1).
- From (4,1), move to (4,2) then (3,2), (4,2), and then to (4,1).
- Finally from (4,1), move to (4,2), from (4,2) to (4,4), reaching the target.

The precise order of movement from (0,0) leading to (4,4) can then be structured as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path uses the elements of the adjacency list to navigate systematically from the start to the end point, ensuring each step is a valid move until reaching the target (4,4).
