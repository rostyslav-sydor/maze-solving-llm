To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). Since the problem setup consists of (row, column) pairs with each representing a vertex in a graph and the links (<-->) representing edges, the solution involves finding a connected path between these vertices using a suitable graph traversal method, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

The adjacency list reveals all possible movements from each point in the maze, forming the graph's structure. Considering each vertex's connectivity, BFS will be appropriate here due to its level-by-level exploration, which efficiently identifies the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

To solve the problem, we would construct the graph from the adjacency list, apply BFS starting from the origin (0,0), and keep track of visited nodes and their predecessors to reconstruct the path once we reach the target (4,4).

Going through the adjacency list manually would mean we follow these nodes' connections and progressively map out a path that connects the start to the finish. When BFS is executed, it efficiently explores neighbors and moves outward, ensuring no potential paths are omitted prematurely.

Here's the reconstructed BFS solution path from (0,0) to (4,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path transcribes the BFS exploration from the origin to the target by checking each node's connections and moving to the next connected node, fulfilling the requirement for a complete trace from start to end, ensuring it's valid per the adjacency relations defined in the problem.
