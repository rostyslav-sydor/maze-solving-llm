To solve the given maze puzzle, we first consider the structure of the maze as defined by the adjacency list provided. The maze can be visualized as a grid based on the connectivity of the coordinates, with vertical and horizontal paths connecting various nodes (coordinates) in the grid. The representation of the maze utilizes a graph, where nodes are individual positions in the maze grid and edges connect adjacent positions if one can directly move between them.

From the adjacency list:
- Nodes are coordinates like (r, c) where r is the row and c is the column.
- Edges show direct connections, e.g., (1,4) <--> (2,4) indicates you can move directly from (1,4) to (2,4) and vice versa.

We are given a starting point (origin) of (0,0) and a target (exit) of (4,4). The goal is to find a path from the origin to the target navigating through the connections defined.

Given the origin and target:
- Start from (0,0).
- Utilize a pathfinding algorithm (like Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, or A*). These algorithms are suitable here as BFS and DFS are good for unweighted graphs like our maze, where each step from one node to an adjacent node is equivalent in cost.
- Explore the graph starting from the origin, marking visited nodes and tracing the path using predecessors until the target node is reached or all possible paths are explored.

For this maze:
1. Start BFS from (0,0), exploring all connected nodes and marking them.
2. Queue the visited but unexplored nodes and continue, keeping track of each nodeâ€™s predecessor to trace the path back once the target is reached.
3. Proceed until (4,4) is found.
   
Using such algorithms, the solution path traced from (0,0) to (4,4) for this specific maze, respecting the connectivity given in the adjacency list and following the shortest path strategy (like with BFS), comes out as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path was identified by tracking movements from starting point to adjacent nodes sequentially until the end point is identified, considering the overall shortest route based on the connections allowed by the adjacency list. Each move represents a legal step in the maze from one cell to an adjacent cell, and no backtracking is necessary in this path because each consecutive step moves closer to the target.
