The maze provided embeds the edges between various nodes in a grid format with the origin (entry point) at (0,0) and the target (exit point) at (4,4). To solve the maze, we can represent this as a classic graph traversal problem where we need to find a path between the start node (origin) and end node (target).

**Steps to Find the Solution:**
1. **Convert the given adjacency list into a usable graph representation.**
2. **Use a pathfinding algorithm, like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore from the origin and trace a route to the target.**
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS) is often more suitable here because it explores the nearest nodes first, ensuring the shortest path is found. It systematically explores all paths layer by layer expanding outward from the origin.
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) method would involve exploring as far as possible along a branch and then backtracking, which is useful but not optimized for shortest paths.
3. **Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant calculations.**
4. **Record the path from the origin to destination once it's deduced.**

Based on the adjacency list, the graph connections were translated, and through Breadth-First Search or similarly suitable methods, we can manually derive the following path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4):

**Derived Path:**
Starting from (0,0), move to (0,1), then proceed to (1,1), followed by (1,2), then to (2,2), and next to (2,3), and onward to (3,3), then to (3,4), and finally reach (4,4). Each move connects directly through available paths in the adjacency list.

Here's the path in the required output format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path ensures a solution from the start to the finish point in the maze, navigating through connected passages as per the adjacency list provided. It's important to note, this path is one of the possible solutions assuming a basic traversal method; variations in path could occur with different algorithmic approaches or specific constraints.
