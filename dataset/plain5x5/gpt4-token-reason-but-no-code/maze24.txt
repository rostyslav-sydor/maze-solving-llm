In this problem, we need to find the path in a maze represented by an adjacency list of graph nodes. The adjacency list specifies which positions or cells in the maze are directly connected. Given start (origin) and end (target) points in the maze, we need to determine a suitable path that connects these two points.

### Analysis and Approach:
To solve the problem, we'll convert the adjacency list into a more usable graph format where each node (in this case, each coordinate pair) is linked to its accessible neighbors. Next, we apply a path-finding algorithm. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a suitable choice for this task because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which agrees with our requirement of finding a path through the maze. 

### Steps:
1. **Graph Construction**:
   Convert the adjacency list into a graph dictionary where each key is a node (coordinate), and the value is a list of immediately reachable neighboring nodes.

2. **Path Finding (BFS Implementation)**:
   Implement BFS starting from the origin node. Track visited nodes and the path taken using a queue and a dictionary for parent tracking.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   Once the target is reached during BFS, backtrack using the parent dictionary to reconstruct the path from the target to the origin.

### Specific Solution for the Provided Maze:
For the given maze, the adjacency list is converted into a graph, and BFS is applied between `(0,0)` and `(4,4)`.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   From the given adjacency list, each node (coordinate pairs) and their connections are noted, forming directly connected graph edges.

2. **Path Finding**:
   Starting at `(0,0)`, BFS explores all reachable nodes. It successively checks and enqueues all reachable nodes from the current node, marking them visited and storing their parent node until the target `(4,4)` is found.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   By backtracking from `(4,4)` using the stored parent nodes in the BFS, we can list the successive nodes starting from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`, forming a continuous path.

Based on the BFS exploration and reconstruction from the graph built from the adjacency pairs, the path for the maze from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` is identified as following:
 
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>`

This path is one of the possible shortest paths connecting entry `(0,0)` to exit `(4,4)` based on the given connections in the maze.
