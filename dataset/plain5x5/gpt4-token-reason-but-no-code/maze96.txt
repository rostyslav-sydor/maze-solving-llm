The provided maze description utilizes adjacency lists to define accessible paths between nodes, where each node is a coordinate point on what appears to be a grid. The entry point, or origin, is given as (0,0) and the exit point, or the target, is (4,4). The challenge lies in tracing a path from the origin to the target within the constraints of the described connections.

To solve this maze, the adjacency list can be conceptualized as a graph wherein each node (coordinate) connects directly to other nodes as specified. From this, one could employ pathfinding algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to explore possible routes from the origin to the target.

Among these choices, BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs like this one, providing the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed, which in a maze corresponds to the minimum number of moves. BFS systematically explores all paths emanating from the origin, expanding outwards and checking each node layer by layer. When it finds the target node, it will have identified the shortest path.

Upon executing BFS with the given connections:
- Begin at (0,0)
- Explore all directly connected nodes, repeatedly expand to neighboring nodes while marking nodes that have been visited.
- Continue this process until we discover the target node (4,4).
- A parent-tracking system will assist in backtracking to compile the sequence of moves taken from origin to target after reaching the target.

After considering the maze connections and engaging BFS, we trace and output the path as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path is obtained by starting at the origin (0,0), moving rightwards across the first row, then moving downward along column 3 and finally rightward towards the exit (4,4). This specific sequence offers a direct and brief route considering the connectivity provisions of the maze.
