To solve the maze outlined in the adjacency list, we need to determine a path that can navigate from the start position (0,0) to the end position (4,4). The adjacency list defines valid movements between neighboring positions in a grid. Our objective is to find a sequence of such moves that connects the starting position to the destination.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Representation**: The maze is given as a graph where each position on the grid is a node, and each movement between directly reachable nodes (positions) is an edge.

2. **Translating the list**: Translate the adjacency list into an easily workable format that reveals which nodes (positions in the maze) are connected directly.

3. **Choose an algorithm**: Given the grid-based nature and our need to find a path from a start to an end node, a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) could be efficient here. BFS is particularly useful as it will find the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this adjacency list represents.

4. **Implementation**: It would involve:
   - Starting at the origin node (0,0).
   - Attempting movement in all possible directions as per the adjacency list.
   - Keeping track of visited nodes to avoid cyclic paths.
   - Capturing parent nodes to backtrace the path once the destination (4,4) is reached.

5. **Path recovery**: Once the destination is reached in the algorithm, backtrack from the destination node up to the origin node using the stored parent nodes to recover the path.

**Solution Path Analysis**:

Using the BFS approach:
- Beginning from the start position (0,0), explore in breadth-first manner.
- Navigate from node to node, tracking where you came from, until you reach node (4,4).
- Construct the actual path by tracking back from (4,4) to (0,0) using the 'parent' pointers/hashes used during the BFS search.

After applying a BFS on the given adjacency list and following the edges mentioned, we derive the shorted path from (0,0) to (4,4).

**Resulting Path**:
Carefully analyzing the adjacency list, respecting the BFS exploration order from (0,0) onwards, and using backtracking from (4,4):

The shortest path (and one possible valid solution) from start to end through the grid is as follows:

`(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4)`

Formatted answer for the solution would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
