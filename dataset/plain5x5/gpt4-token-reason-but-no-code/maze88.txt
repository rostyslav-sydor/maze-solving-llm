To determine the path from the entrance `(0,0)` to the exit `(4,4)` in the provided maze, we need to trace a sequence of connected coordinates as specified in the adjacency list.

Let's begin by finding an effective path using the adjacency list provided, which is essentially the edges in the graph connecting different nodes (coordinates of the maze). The challenge is to construct a path through these nodes from the designated start to the destination point.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Starting at `(0,0)`, the adjacent coordinates are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`. We could explore paths from both, but let's proceed with `(1,0)` for simplicity.

2. From `(1,0)`, the next adjacent coordinate available is its right point `(2,0)`.

3. Continuing from `(2,0)`, we can move to `(3,0)`, further following the network of connections.

4. Once at `(3,0)`, the adjacent nodes are `(4,0)` and `(3,1)` as possible paths. Moving to `(4,0)` continues the trajectory to the right towards our target row `4`.

5. We then move sequentially from `(4,0)` through `(4,1)`, then to `(4,2)`, to `(4,3)`, and finally to `(4,4)`, which is the exit.

This route utilizes the available connections in the graph directly towards our end point without backtracking, ensuring a path that proceeds steadily rightward and upwards towards the target coordinate `(4,4)` in the last row.

As you can see, at every step, the chosen path moves closer to the target, exploiting the given adjacency relationships in the maze.

Finally, the specific solution for this maze starts from the origin and progresses through a series of continuous steps reaching the target as described:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze using available pathways as dictated by the adjacency list, reaching the exit optimally without unnecessary exploration of other nodes.
