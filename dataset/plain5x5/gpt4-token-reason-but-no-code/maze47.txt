The problem involves navigating a graph represented as an adjacency list from a designated start point `(0,0)` to a target point `(4,4)`. 

In essence, the adjacency list provides each node's direct neighbors in the maze, essentially defining passable pathways between coordinates in a grid.

We need to trace a path from the start point to the target point using the maze's connectivity rules. The adjacency relationships in this list define which moves are possible between nodes (coordinates of the maze).

We should plan on using pathfinding algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), as these will exhaustively and systematically explore each node's neighbors until the target is reached. BFS, for instance, would efficiently find the shortest path due to its level-wise exploration attribute, which is well-suited for unweighted graphs or grids like this one.

**Solution Path:**
Given the grid's adjacency, BFS would typically expand outwards from the start location `(0,0)`, using the adjacency list to look up and queue each passage from our current node to its direct neighbors. It would continue this process iteratively until `(4,4)` is reached. Each step involves marking visited nodes and tracking the path back from the target to the source using a predecessor map, which remembers where each visited node was reached from.

For the maze provided, by analyzing the adjacency list, the shortest path (although manually derived for this request) from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` considering all described connections is as follows:

1. Start at `(0,0)`.
2. Move to `(0,1)`, using the connection `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`.
3. Move to `(1,1)`, using the connection `(0,1) <--> (1,1)`.
4. Move to `(1,2)`, using the connection `(1,2) <--> (1,1)`.
5. Move to `(2,2)`, using the connection `(1,2) <--> (2,2)`.
6. Move to `(3,2)`, using the connection `(2,2) <--> (3,2)`.
7. From `(3,2)`, move to `(3,3)`, using `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`. 
8. Move to `(3,4)`, using `(3,3) <--> (3,4)`. 
9. Move to `(4,4)`, using `(3,4) <--> (4,4)`.

Each move adheres to the adjacency rules provided, and no jumps are made unless explicitly allowed by the maze's structure.

Thus the path from origin to target is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
