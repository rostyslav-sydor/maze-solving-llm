To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4) using the adjacency list given. The adjacency list defines which points are connected directly, and can hence be traversed to reach the destination.

Starting from the origin (0,0), we follow paths that lead towards the exit, avoiding loops and backtracking when necessary. Given the maze's structure, a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm is typically used in such scenarios as they efficiently explore all available paths.

Starting our search:
1. From (0,0) to (0,1) - It's a connected path.
2. Now, move from (0,1) to (0,2) - also directly connected.
3. Next, from (0,2) to (0,3), a continuation rightwards.
4. From (0,3) to (0,4) and then (0,4) to (1,4) showing upward traversal.
5. Move from (1,4) to (2,4) as part of a move deeper into the maze.
6. From (2,4) directly to (3,4).
7. Lastly, from (3,4) to (4,4), reaching the target.

Thus, the solution path traced using BFS or DFS and keeping track of visited nodes along the connected paths in the adjacency list forms a continuous journey from the origin to the target without revisiting any nodes, ensuring the shortest path in terms of traversal through maze segments.

Here is the formatted solution as specified:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
