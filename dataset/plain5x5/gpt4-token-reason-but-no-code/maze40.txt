To solve the maze provided, we'll consider it as a graph where each cell is a node and each connection between cells (edges) is described in the adjacency list. We are asked to find a path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`.

From the adjacency list, we understand that the maze includes several points and their connections, forming viable pathways between these points. Our task is to determine a valid sequence of steps from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,4)` following these connections.

A common approach for this type of problem is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) due to its utility in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Process:
1. The BFS starts at the origin `(0,0)` and explores all neighboring nodes by following edges defined in the adjacency list.
2. From each node, it keeps exploring until it reaches the target `(4,4)` or exhausts all possible paths.
3. To keep track of the path, we maintain a record of each node and its parent node. From the target node, we can backtrack using this parent relationship to determine the full path from origin to target.

Here is how the actual steps would unwind using our adjacency list:

1. Start at `(0,0)`, neighbors are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. Exploring from `(1,0)`, we have options to go to `(2,0)` or back to `(0,0)`.
   
   Similarly, from `(0,1)`, the path leads to `(0,2)` or `(1,1)`.
3. Continuing this way, the BFS will explore adjacent nodes:
   - From `(2,0)` to `(3,0)` then `(4,0)`
   - From `(4,0)` to `(3,0)` and `(4,1)`
   - Keep exploring in the increasing direction mainly (if possible) to reach our destination `(4,4)`.

### Providing the Solution:
Our goal is to find a continuous path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`:

From `(0,0)`:
- Move horizontally using the adjacency list direction until you meet a vertical opportunity that will eventually help you move towards the target `(4,4)`.

The specific solution considering a balance of horizontal(towards right) and vertical(towards down) paths would be:
- `(0,0)` --> `(1,0)` (right)
- `(1,0)` --> `(2,0)` (right)
- `(2,0)` --> `(3,0)` (right)
- `(3,0)` --> `(4,0)` (right)
- `(4,0)` --> `(4,1)` (down)
- `(4,1)` --> `(4,2)` (down)
- `(4,2)` --> `(4,3)` (down)
- `(4,3)` --> `(3,3)` (left as a necessary backward step)
- `(3,3)` --> `(3,4)` (up)
- `(3,4)` --> `(4,4)` (right)

This path logically follows the connections listed in the adjacency description, fulfilling all steps within the bounds given:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This solution leverages the most direct path based on the given connections, using horizontal movement as the primary strategy supplemented by critical vertical movements to reach the goal.
