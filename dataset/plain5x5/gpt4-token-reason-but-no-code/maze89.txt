Given the adjacency list, the graph depicts the passageways (edges) connecting various rooms (vertices) in a maze. Our objective is to trace a path from the entrance (0,0) to the exit (4,4).

To solve the maze, a common approach involves utilizing graph traversal techniques such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly suited here as it explores the graph level by level and guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

Starting from (0,0), we look at its adjacent rooms and keep exploring their neighbors while marking each visited room to avoid revisiting and creating cycles. We proceed until we reach the target room (4,4).

Following BFS, the path found to be connecting (0,0) to (4,4) through valid adjacencies from the provided list is the sequence of moves that consistently progresses towards the goal:

1. Start at (0,0), then move right or down based on connections. Move to (1,0), connected directly.
2. From (1,0) move vertically to (1,1), which is also connected.
3. From (1,1) move horizontally to (1,2).
4. From (1,2) proceed to (2,2), maintaining a southward direction.
5. From (2,2) continue to (2,3).
6. From (2,3) go to (3,3) directly; this maintains the direct southward direction towards the goal.
7. Then, proceed to (3,2).
8. From (3,2) moving to (3,1) brings us closer in alignment with the targetâ€™s x-axis position.
9. From (3,1) move to (3,2) again.
10. From (3,2) directly up to (4,2). 
11. From (4,2) move to (4,3).
12. Finally, arrive at (4,4) from (4,3).

This path navigates through the given adjacency list by climbing row-wise while making zig-zag horizontal movements typically required in maze navigation within the constraint of connected points until we reach the goal position.

Hence, the solution to navigate from the start to the destination in the maze follows this path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
