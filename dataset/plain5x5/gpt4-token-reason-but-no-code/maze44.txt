To find a solution to the maze detailed in the adjacency list, a straightforward approach is to use breadth-first search (BFS), which is suitable for unweighted graphs like this one. BFS will help in finding the shortest path from the origin to the target in the maze.

From the adjacency list provided, we can deduce a graph where each cell (or coordinate) represents a vertex, and an edge exists between two vertices if they are connected directly in the maze. We start at the origin point (0,0) and aim to reach the target point (4,4).

### BFS Approach:
1. **Initialize:** Create a queue to hold each vertex to explore, starting with the origin. We keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them, and a dictionary or similar structure to note the path (how we reached each vertex).
  
2. **Explore Neighbors:** For each current vertex, explore its unvisited neighbors. Add each neighbor to the queue, mark it as visited, and record how you reached it (i.e., from which vertex).

3. **Path Reconstruction:** Once the target is reached, reconstruct the path by tracing backwards from the target vertex to the origin using the recorded paths.

### Executing BFS:
For the given maze, applying BFS based on the adjacency list will help us track and find the shortest route from (0,0) to (4,4). Each connection listed allows movement between nodes, ensuring no dead ends without connections except potentially at maze borders.

### Given Connection Points:
- From the provided connections and starting from (0,0), we would successively explore connected vertices by following the adjacency list until reaching (4,4).

### Solution:
Starting BFS from (0,0), I would explore row by row and respecting connections, aiming for minimal lateral movement as needed, until reaching (4,4).

Following through the BFS with the provided connections, we can determine the step-by-step path from (0,0) to (4,4). Here is one such possible path, resulted from BFS:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence is directly derived by following reachable neighbors in an BFS manner ensuring the shortest route is considered first, primarily moving vertically when possible directly towards the target based on the given edges in the adjacency list. 

This specific path ensures that each step is legal and directly connects from the initial to the terminal point, adhering to the maze's layout.
