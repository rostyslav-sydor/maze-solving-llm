To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, we first need to interpret and visualize the layout and connections among different points or coordinates in a 2D grid pattern. The adjacency list specifies which points are directly connected to each other, meaning a direct path exists between those points. The maze is bounded by the points (0,0) to (4,4) based on the maximum values given in the connections.

We have an entry point at (0,0) and an exit point at (4,4), as specified in the input.

The approach to solving the maze is to use a maze traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is particularly well-suited for unweighted graphs like this one where all moves have equal cost and we want to find the shortest path from the start (entry point) to the target (exit point).

BFS explores the graph in layers, ensuring that we explore all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property guarantees that the first time we reach the target, we have found the shortest path.

The adjacency list provided allows us to construct the graph in a structured manner where for each node (i.e., a coordinate in the grid), we can list its directly connected neighbors. From the list:

- Start constructing the graph from point (0,0).
- Begin BFS by enqueueing the starting point and explore all reachable points, layer by layer.
- For each point, check its neighbors and continue until the point (4,4) is reached.

Letâ€™s specifically visualize the BFS exploration based on the adjacencies:

1. Start BFS from (0,0). Possible immediate moves are to (0,1) and (1,0).
2. From (0,1), we can further move to (0,2).
3. From (1,0), we can move to (1,1).
4. Continue this exploration strategically using BFS until reaching (4,4).

Here's a path found using the BFS method and confirming the first reach to (4,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents the shortest route to navigate through the maze from (0,0) to (4,4) based on BFS traversal and checking available paths at each step as per the adjacency list.
