To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, we first interpret the list to understand how the nodes (positions in the maze) are connected. We then derive a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (4,4) by considering these connections.

Given the adjacency list, the maze is set up like a grid where each tuple (i, j) connects to other tuples directly, allowing horizontal or vertical movement but no diagonal. Our goal is to find a route from (0,0) to (4,4).

For clarity, let's order the connections for ease of traversal:
1. (0,0) <--> (1,0)
2. (0,0) <--> (0,1)
3. (0,1) <--> (1,1)
...
and so forth as per adjacency connections listed.

Then we'll adopt a simple strategy of breadth-first-search (BFS) to explore and find the shortest path from the start point to the end point. BFS is appropriate here since it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thus ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.

Starting from the origin (0,0), the BFS explores all accessible nodes by following every linked node. By systematically checking each connection, we find possible routes to the destination.

After processing the links and exploring the routes, we find that one valid shortest path from (0,0) to (4,4) (considered across minimal steps and without backtracking unnecessarily) in the maze, based on the connections provided and the configuration of the grid, is:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)

Providing the specific solution for the maze between the tokens as specified:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
This path is efficiently derived considering all horizontal movement until the last column and then straightforward vertical movement to the bottom row, indicating no extraneous moves are necessary given the direct connections each step of the way.
