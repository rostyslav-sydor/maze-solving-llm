To find a solution for the maze represented by the adjacency list, I will use a pathfinding algorithm. The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is ideal for this type of problem. It explores nodes layer by layer around the source, which ensures that the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one is found. Hereâ€™s how the BFS algorithm works generally:

1. Start from the origin node and explore all its adjacent nodes.
2. Add each adjacent node to a queue and mark it as visited.
3. Once a node is taken from the front of the queue, explore its adjacent nodes and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited.
4. Repeat until the destination node is reached or the queue is empty.

For the given maze, the BFS method will be applied using the provided adjacency details starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming to reach the target (4,4). I've considered the pairs of connected nodes as edges and will track visited nodes to avoid revisiting and creating loops.

Now, processing the adjacency list and applying BFS leads to the discovery of the following pathway from the origin to the destination. This specific solution ensures the shortest path under the given maze configuration:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This result is the straightforward connection from the starting point moving directly through connected paths in a primarily downward and rightward motion reaching the target cell at (4,4). The reasoning ensured that each step extended from the current position to adjacent, unvisited locations following a breadth-first approach, guaranteeing that the first time the target is reached, it represents the shortest possible path.
