To solve the maze given in the adjacency list, we need to interpret the connections and paths available and then devise a strategy to reach from the designated origin to the target point.

### Understanding the Maze
From the adjacency list provided, the maze comprises various nodes (coordinate points), where each pair of nodes connected by an edge signifies a direct passable route between those two points in the maze. For example, the pair (2,3) <--> (2,4) indicates a direct route between coordinates (2,3) and (2,4).

### Maze Layout
- We are given that the origin of the maze is (0,0) and the target of the maze is (4,4).
- The adjacency list clarifies which points in the grid are directly connected. 

### Solution Approach
Given the need to reach from the origin to the target:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)** could be employed to search for the path. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which is useful for finding all possible paths but can be inefficient. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth, which is often more efficient for this kind of search where the shortest path is needed.

2. **Formation of Graph**: Convert the adjacency pairs into a graph representation (e.g., using a dictionary of lists where each coordinate point maps to its directly reachable neighbors).

3. **Pathfinding Execution**: Implement BFS, taking into account all possible paths from the origin and continuously extending them until the path reaches the target. Each time a node is visited, make sure to mark it to avoid re-visiting and creating cycles.

### Specific Solution Path
- Initialize at the origin (0,0).
- Progressively follow the maze's paths, maintaining a record of visited nodes to prevent cycles.
- Find a path using BFS, ensuring you're choosing the shortest route based on our adjacency list setup.

Here is the solution based on the adjacency list:

**Understanding BFS Progress**:
- Start from (0,0), move to adjacent nodes like (0,1) and (1,0).
- From both of these nodes, expand further based on adjacency until reaching the target (4,4).

**Resulting Path**:
The BFS approach helps in exploring paths level by level, and from these explained progressions and adjacency connections, we find the valid path from (0,0) to (4,4).

Hence, the BFS through the given connections (following shortest path criteria inherent in BFS when every edge has the same weight/cost), provides us the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

Here, each step proceeded to the next available point moving towards the target directly or indirectly, ensuring each node was visited no more than once.
