To solve the maze, we need to determine a path from the origin to the target by traversing through connected vertices. Here, vertices are pairs denoting coordinates in a grid, and edges between them signify that one can move directly from one coordinate to the other. Given that this maze is represented as an adjacency list, our task is to find a path from coordinate (0,0) to (4,4) using the connections provided.

A suitable approach to solve such maze problems, especially when provided as adjacency lists or graphs, is to use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly effective because it explores the closest nodes first before moving on to nodes that are farther away, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. 

Given the adjacency list and the BFS approach, hereâ€™s the high-level understanding of what happens:

1. Start BFS from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all direct neighbors of (0,0), then the neighbors of these neighbors, and so forth.
3. Use a queue to manage the exploration, enqueuing each new vertex once and dequeueing in FIFO order to ensure shortest path examination.
4. Keep track of visited vertices to avoid revisits and loops which ensures efficiency.
5. Stop BFS when the target (4,4) is dequeued thus ensuring that the path reached is the shortest.
6. Trace back the path from the target (4,4) to the origin (0,0) using the predecessor relationships established during BFS exploration.

By performing the BFS correctly, we can construct the shortest path for the given maze from (0,0) to (4,4) which, based on the adjacency connections listed, would effectively go through the nodes:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) as (0,0) is directly connected to (0,1)
- Move to (0,2)
- Then through (1,2)
- To (2,2)
- Then to (2,3)
- Move to (3,3)
- Next to (3,4)
- Reach (4,4) which is our target.

Each move is to an adjacent, directly connected vertex, ensuring the path is both valid and, given our approach with BFS, as short as possible.

Let's compile that into the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This sequence is extracted through BFS applied on the adjacency list provided, navigating through each position in the maze starting from the origin to the destination.
