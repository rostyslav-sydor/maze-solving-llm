In this approach, I will use breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph presented in the adjacency list, since BFS is an efficient search algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze like this. BFS will explore neighbors level by level, guaranteeing that we reach any node in the shortest number of moves.

Given the adjacency list, we can understand how the nodes (maze positions) are connected:

- Connections shown in the list indicate between which points we can move directly.
- The entry point or start is provided as (0,0).
- The exit or target point is provided as (4,4).

Applying the BFS:

1. Begin the BFS from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all directly reachable nodes, marking each visited node to avoid cycles and storing each node's predecessor to reconstruct the path later.
3. Continue exploring until the target (4,4) is reached.

After applying BFS and tracking the path from source to destination, the path from (0,0) to (4,4) through the graph, considering the shortest route using this method and the given adjacency list, is found to be:

From (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4).

Now, presenting the solution in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This particular solution details the shortest path identified using BFS in the adjacency graph maze, going from the initial point (0,0) to the target point (4,4), and adheres to the direct connections indicated in the adjacency list.
