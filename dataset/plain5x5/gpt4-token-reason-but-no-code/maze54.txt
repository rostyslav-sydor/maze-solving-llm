To solve the given maze represented as an adjacency list, we start by determining the path from the specified origin to the target. The origin is at coordinate (0,0) and the target is at (4,4). The path must be determined by navigating through relationships described in the adjacency list.

By utilizing a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search), which is appropriate for unweighted graphs, we systematically explore all possible paths from the origin to the target. BFS is chosen because it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted scenario such as this.

1. We start at (0,0), exploring all directly-connected nodes.
2. Reachable from (0,0) are: (0,1).
3. Reachable from subsequent exploration of (0,1) are: a backtrack to (0,0) or a move to (1,1) by going from (0,1) to (1,1).
4. Continuing this exploration through the adjacency list, ensuring not to revisit nodes unless necessary (to avoid cycles and inefficiency) and keeping track of the path that connects (0,0) to (4,4).

Based on the adjacency list, here is a complete step-by-step traversal to (4,4):

- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) [reach via (0,0)]
- Travel to (1,1) [connect (0,1)]
- Navigate to (1,2) [connect (1,1)]
- Proceed to (0,2) [connect to (1,2)]
- Move to (0,3) [connection exists (0,2)]
- Proceed to (1,3) via (1,4) connecting back to (0,3) and forward to (1,4)
- Move to (2,3) [from (1,3)]
- Progress to (1,3) and then via (3,3) to (3,4)
- Reach (4,4) from (3,4)

Ensuring the path connections based on the adjacency list and omitting any unnecessary cycles or redundant steps, the shortest possible route in coordinate format encapsulated by the specified tokens is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
