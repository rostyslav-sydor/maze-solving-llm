The given maze is constructed as an adjacency list, whereby each pair of coordinates represents a connection between points in a grid, making each pair a valid, navigable pathway. The origin entry point of the maze is at (0,0) and the target exit point is at (4,4).

To solve this maze, one would need to trace a path from the origin to the target by following the connected points in the adjacency list, ensuring each move is valid (i.e., the move corresponds to a direct connection between two points as listed in the adjacency list).

Given the structure of the adjacency list:

- The entry point (0,0) is connected directly to (0,1) and (1,0).
- You will further trace the connections from each of these points to the other points, following the maze's corridors as outlined in adjacency connections, ensuring continuous point connectivity until reaching the final point (4,4).

The approach involves breadth-first traversal of the graph, ensuring comprehensive exploration of all viable paths, generally considered suitable for mazes as it explores layer by layer from the start point and is able to handle varied path lengths effectively. By manually or algorithmically tracing the paths listed, ensuring to check for direct links (touching sides) from the adjacency structure provided, we move from point to point.

Here is the solution for the specific maze provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This route vividly shows the pathway of connected points from the origin to the target as per the adjacency listed connections, tracing a feasible route across the provided maze. The selected path is the shortest path found by following the connections from point to point until reaching the designated exit. Each step is chosen based on available and viable connected pathways directly dictated by the maze's adjacency list structure.
