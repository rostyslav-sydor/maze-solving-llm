To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the start position (0,0) to the end position (4,4) by moving through the connected paths as specified by the adjacency list.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning for tracing the path in the maze:

1. Start at the origin (0,0). From here, check the adjacency list to see possible movements. You can move to (0,1) or (1,0).

2. Move to (0,1) from (0,0). Next possible movements from (0,1) are to (1,1) or to (0,0) (back to the start) or (0,2).

3. Proceed to (0,2) from (0,1). From (0,2), movements can be to (1,2) or to (0,3).

4. Move to (0,3) from (0,2). From here, you can move to (0,2) (back) or to (0,4).

5. Continue to (0,4) from (0,3), and from (0,4), movement can be to (1,4).

6. Move to (1,4) from (0,4). From (1,4), possibilities are back to (0,4) or progressing to (2,4).

7. Navigate to (2,4) from (1,4). From (2,4), possible paths lead to (1,4) (back) or to (2,3).

8. Travel to (2,3) from (2,4). From (2,3), the options are to move to (2,2), (2,4) (back) or (3,3).

9. From (2,3), move to (3,3). Options from (3,3) are to advance to (3,4) or to backtrack to (2,3).

10. Progress to (3,4) from (3,3). From (3,4), potential moves are back to (3,3) or forward to (4,4), which is our goal.

By following the above steps, we find the pathway from the start (0,0) to the end (4,4) through the connections given in the maze's adjacency list. Here's the formulated path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This sequence of moves provides a viable route through the maze, respecting all the given connections and successfully leading from the specified origin to the target destination.
