To solve the given maze which is described by an adjacency list, the primary goal is to navigate from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,4). A common algorithm suitable for this problem is the depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), which systematically explores paths through the graph until it finds a valid route from the starting point to the end.

Given the symmetric representation of connections as bidirectional in the adjacency list (e.g., (1,2) â†” (1,3)), it is clear that movement is possible in back and forth directions between connected points, implying an undirected graph.

Here's a breakdown of how the reasoning proceeds to solve this problem:
1. Translate the adjacency list notation into a more manageable format, ideally a graph representation where each node has a list of connections.
2. Apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) technique:
   - BFS is chosen over DFS because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
   - Initialize the BFS with the origin node `(0,0)` and repeatedly explore all connected nodes, tracking visited nodes and the path taken using a queue.
   - At each node, check all possible moves (neighbors) as listed in the adjacency connections and move there if it has not been visited, marking it as visited.
   - Stop once you reach the target `(4,4)`.
3. Construct the path from the origin to the target by backtracking from the target to the origin using the recorded moves.

Following this strategy, and referring to the adjacency list provided:
- The problem description ensures there's a series of connections between coordinates, and it initializes BFS with the node `(0,0)`.
- Search proceeds by exploring each neighboring node as connected, marking it visited, and recording the route.
- Continue this until reaching `(4,4)`.

By manually or programmatically following the connections and conducting BFS (as described), we can derive the shortest path:
- Starting at (0,0), moving right through (0,1) to (0,2), then (0,3) and up to (0,4).
- Proceed right through (1,4), then successive moves passing through (2,4), (3,4), and finally reaching (4,4).

This provides the path using BFS which ensures the shortest route in this unweighted graph scenario. Hence, the solution for this specific maze will be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
