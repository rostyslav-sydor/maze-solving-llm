To solve the maze with the given adjacency list, we first need to understand the structure in a clearer format by listing out all connections or "paths" between points in a way that respects their spatial relationship. The adjacency list provided already gives us the exact paths between directly connected cells, but it's helpful to visualize these connections on a theoretical grid. 

From the problem statement, we know:
- Entry point (origin): (0,0)
- Exit point (target): (4,4)

We can then trace a route from (0,0) to (4,4) using available pathways:

1. Start from the origin (0,0), and look at connections: (0,0) directly connects to (0,1) and (1,0).
2. From (0,1), move next to (0,2) because it's a direct connection.
3. Moving from (0,2) to (0,3) is also a direct route following the adjacency list.
4. From (0,3) we can move to (0,4) because they are connected.
5. From grid point (0,4), a connection is present directly to (1,4).
6. From (1,4), following the direct connection, move to (2,4).
7. Next, (2,4) to (3,4) is a valid move defined by adjacency.
8. Finally from (3,4), reaching to (4,4) is possible as they are adjacent.

This creates a linear path from the origin to the destination without needing to revisit or loop around any nodes thanks to the clear line of adjacency. The direct path transforms into a list of coordinates starting from the bottom-left corner of the maze (0,0) and ending at the upper right (4,4), following a zigzag-like pattern diagonally upward through the grid.

By following this path we trace:
- Start at (0,0),
- go to (0,1),
- then to (0,2),
- next go to (0,3),
- moving to (0,4),
- up to (1,4),
- next to (2,4),
- then (3,4),
- and finally reaching the target at (4,4).

This movement is completely aligned with the adjacency connections provided and successfully brings you from the entrance to the exit of the maze without any detours.

Now to put this into the desired output format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This lists each move from start to finish, providing a clear solution to the maze challenge.
