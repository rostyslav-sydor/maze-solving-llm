To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list of coordinates, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,4). The maze is a type of graph where nodes are coordinates in a grid, and edges indicate permissible movements between adjacent grid cells. 

1. **Parsing the Adjacency List**: The first step is to parse and construct a meaningful graph structure. Each pair represents a bidirectional relationship, meaning you can move between the connected vertices both ways.

2. **Selecting an Algorithm**: Since we need a path between two nodes in a graph, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a good choice as it explores neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in unweighted graphs like ours.

3. **Implementing BFS**: Using BFS, we start at the origin node (0,0), exploring all adjacent nodes layer by layer, marking visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the BFS reaches the target node (4,4), the path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target to the origin using a predecessor map populated during the BFS search.

Following the BFS approach on the provided maze:

- Starting from (0,0), the possible moves are to (0,1) and (1,0).
- Expanding further from these nodes, the algorithm would continue to explore unvisited neighboring nodes.
- This expansion continues until the algorithm reaches (4,4).

Now, performing the BFS based on the adjacency data given, your path from (0,0) to (4,4) would realistically follow these steps:

- Start from (0,0), go to (1,0) as it is directly connectible.
- From (1,0), proceed to (2,0).
- From (2,0), go to (2,1), then (2,2), and then to (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (3,3).
- From (3,3), go to (4,3), and finally reach (4,4).

Let's compile this into the given format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This resulting path offers a plausible route through the maze from the starting point to the target following the shortest connection principles of BFS and using the adjacency relationships provided in the list.
