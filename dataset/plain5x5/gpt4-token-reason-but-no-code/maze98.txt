To solve the maze given in an adjacency list format, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. Each pair in the adjacency list represents two connected points in the maze. An optimal solution is to find the shortest path from the entry point, labeled as `(0,0)`, to the exit point, labeled as `(4,4)`.

For this graphical representation of a maze using adjacent nodes, a common approach is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS). This is because BFS efficiently explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which ensures that if a path exists, the shortest route will be among the first examined.

Now, considering the provided maze:
- The entry point is `(0,0)`.
- The exit point is `(4,4)`.

We implement BFS on this adjacency list, moving node by node until we locate a path connecting the origin and target. This method navigates through all possible pathways from the origin, systematically expanding outward until it reaches the target, ensuring that the earliest time we encounter the target is the shortest pathway dne to BFS properties.

Applying BFS to this specific adjacency list (after translating it into a more usable structure within a typical solving context), we find that a possible shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` passes through these coordinates in order:

1. Start at `(0,0)`
2. Move to `(0,1)` following path `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`
3. From `(0,1)` move to `(0,2)` via `(0,2) <--> (0,1)`
4. Proceed from `(0,2)` to `(0,3)` with `(0,2) <--> (0,3)`
5. Go from `(0,3)` to `(0,4)` along `(0,3) <--> (0,4)`
6. Continue from `(0,4)` to `(1,4)` along `(1,4) <--> (0,4)`
7. Move from `(1,4)` to `(2,4)` through `(1,4) <--> (2,4)`
8. Progress from `(2,4)` to `(3,4)` via `(2,4) <--> (3,4)`
9. Finally, advance from `(3,4)` to `(4,4)` following `(4,4) <--> (3,4)`

This provides a clear and direct route to the exit without backtracking or unnecessary moves.

Thus, the solution to the maze can be represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This solution demonstrates the shortest path calculated based on the adjacency list provided.
