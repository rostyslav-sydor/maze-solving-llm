Here is the solution to this maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The entry point is (0,0), and the exit point is (3,3).

- From the entry point (0,0), we can move to the adjacent cell (0,1).
- From (0,1), we can move to the adjacent cell (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can move to the adjacent cell (0,3).
- From (0,3), we can move to the adjacent cell (1,3).
- From (1,3), we can move to the adjacent cell (2,3).
- From (2,3), we can move to the adjacent cell (3,3), which is the exit point.

This path does not cross any walls, and it uses only adjacent cells.
