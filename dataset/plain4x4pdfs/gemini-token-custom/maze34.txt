<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
2. Move down to (1,1) and then right to (2,1).
3. Move up to (1,1) and then right to (2,1).
4. Move down to (2,2) and then right to (3,2).
5. Move up to (2,3) and then right to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking the Path:**

- The path does not cross any walls because it follows the edges of the maze.
- The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is to a cell that is directly adjacent to the previous cell.
