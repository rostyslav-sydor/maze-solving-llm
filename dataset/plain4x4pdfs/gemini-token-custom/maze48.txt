<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning**

To find our direction, we look at the first edge from the origin coordinate.

The first edge goes to (0,2), which is south of the origin.
So we move south.

When we evaluate the adjacency list at (0,2), we see that both edges are north of this coordinate.
Since we came from the south, we must move north.

We continue to move north, then east, then north, then east, then north, then east, and finally north again to reach the target.

**Checking**

Since we followed edges in the adjacency list for every step, we are confident that we did not cross any walls.
We also only moved between adjacent cells since we only moved north, east, and south.
