<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

- Starting from the origin (0,0) we can move right to (0,1) as (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- From (0,1) we can move right to (0,2) as (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- From (0,2) we can move down to (1,2) as (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- From (1,2) we can move right to (1,3) as (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- From (1,3) we can move down to (2,3) as (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- From (2,3) we can move right to (3,3) as (3,3) <--> (2,3)

All the movements are between adjacent cells and they do not cross any walls as indicated by the absence of edges between non-adjacent cells in the adjacency list.
