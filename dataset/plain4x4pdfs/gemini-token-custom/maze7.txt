**SOLUTION:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>


**REASONING:**

- Start from the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0).

- Move right to (1,0).
- Move down to (1,1).
- Move right to (2,1).
- Move up to (2,0).
- Move right to (3,0).
- Move down to (3,1).
- Move right to (2,1). 
- Move down to (2,2)
- Move right to (2,3) 
- Move down to (3,3) which is the target <TARGET_END>

**CHECKING:**
- The path never crosses a wall because it only moves through adjacent cells.
- The path starts at the origin and ends at the target.
- The path does not contain loops or cross itself.
