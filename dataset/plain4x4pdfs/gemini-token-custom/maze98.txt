<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

* Start at the origin (0,0).
* Move right to (0,1).
* Move down to (0,2).
* Move right to (1,2).
* Move up to (1,1).
* Move right to (1,2).
* Move down to (1,3).
* Move right to (2,3).
* Move down to (3,3) (target).

**Checking the solution:**

* The path does not cross any walls, as it only moves along adjacent cells in the adjacency list.
* The path uses only adjacent cells, as it only moves along edges in the adjacency list.
