A valid solution for the given maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

From the starting point (0,0), we move right to (1,0), then move down to (1,1). From (1,1), we move right to (1,2), then move down to (1,3). From (1,3), we move right to (2,3), then move down to (3,3), which is the endpoint.

**Verification:**

It is easy to verify that the solution does not cross any walls. Each move is either right, down, or left, and there is no wall between any two adjacent cells in the path. Also, the path uses only adjacent cells. Each move is to a cell that is either directly to the right, left, or down/up from the current cell.
