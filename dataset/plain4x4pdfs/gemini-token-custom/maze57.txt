<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning**: 
- Start from the origin cell (0,0) marked with <ORIGIN_START> token
- Then move right to cell (1,0)
- From there move down to cell (1,1)
- Continue moving right to cells (1,2) and (1,3)
- Turn down to cell (2,3)
- Finally move right to the target cell (3,3) marked with <TARGET_END> token

**Verification**: 
- The path does not cross any walls, as it follows the edges of the maze
- The path uses only adjacent cells, as each move is either one step to the right or one step down
