<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin and moves right one cell to (1,0). From there, it moves down one cell to (1,1). The path then moves right one cell to (1,2), and then up one cell to (1,3). From (1,3), the path moves right one cell to (2,3), and then up one cell to (3,3), which is the target.

Each step in the path moves from one cell to an adjacent cell, and none of the steps cross any walls. Therefore, this path is a valid solution to the maze.
