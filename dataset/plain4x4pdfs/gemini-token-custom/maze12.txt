We start at the starting cell and find all adjacent cells.
From (0,0) the only adjacent cell is (1,0).

Then we move to (1,0) and find all adjacent cells.
From (1,0) the adjacent cells are (0,0), (2,0), and (1,1).

We continue this process until we reach the ending cell.
From (1,1) the adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1).
From (1,2) the adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,3), and (2,2).
From (1,3) the adjacent cells are (1,2), (2,3), and (0,3).
From (2,3) the adjacent cells are (1,3) and (3,3).
From (3,3) the adjacent cells are (2,3).

The path from the starting cell to the ending cell is:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

**Note**:
 - The path never passes through a wall cell because only adjacent cells are considered for the movement.
 - The path is the shortest one because it traverses the minimum number of cells to get to the end cell
