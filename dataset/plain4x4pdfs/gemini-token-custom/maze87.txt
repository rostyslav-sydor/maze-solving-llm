<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:

- Start from the origin point (0,0).
- Move right to (1,0).
- Move down to (1,1).
- Move right to (1,2).
- Move down to (1,3).
- Move right to (2,3).
- Finally, move down to (3,3) to reach the target point.

Checking the solution:

- The path does not cross any walls.
- The path uses only adjacent cells.
- The path starts from the origin point (0,0) and ends at the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution is valid.
