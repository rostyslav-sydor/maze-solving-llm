**Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move down to (0,3).
5. Move right to (1,3).
6. Move down to (2,3).
7. Move right to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking the solution:**

1. Each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell.
2. The path does not cross any walls, as each cell is connected to the next by an edge in the adjacency list.

Therefore, the solution is a valid path from the origin to the target.
