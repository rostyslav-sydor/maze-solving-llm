The adjacency list format of mazes represents walls with missing edges between the coordinates. Therefore, if we want to go from one coordinate to another, there must be an edge between them in the adjacency list. This means that the only traversal we can do is to follow existing edges.

Let's find a path by following edges that connect entry and exit points

<PATH_START> (0,0) <--> (1,0) <--> (2,0) <--> (3,0) <--> (3,1) <--> (3,2) <--> (3,3) <PATH_END>

We can see that no walls are crossed as no movement occurs between coordinates that do not have an edge connecting them. Also, each step in the path uses only adjacent cells.
