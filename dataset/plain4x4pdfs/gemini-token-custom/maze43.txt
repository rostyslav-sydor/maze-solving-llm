<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Move right one unit to (1,0).
3. Move down one unit to (1,1).
4. Move right one unit to (1,2).
5. Move down one unit to (1,3).
6. Move right one unit to (2,3).
7. Move up one unit to (2,2).
8. Move right one unit to (3,2).
9. Move up one unit to (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent cells. To verify this, we can check that each move is either right, left, up, or down by one unit, and that the destination cell is adjacent to the current cell.
