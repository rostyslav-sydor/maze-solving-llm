**Reasoning:**

* Start at the origin (0,0) and move towards the target (3,3).
* At each step, check all adjacent cells and choose the one that is closest to the target.
* If there are multiple adjacent cells that are equally close to the target, choose the one that has not been visited before.

**Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Verification:**

* The path does not cross any walls, as each step is to an adjacent cell.
* The path uses only adjacent cells, as each step is to a cell that is directly next to the previous cell.
