<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and moves right to (1,0). Then, it moves down to (1,1). From there, it moves right to (2,1), then down to (2,2), and finally right to (3,2) and up one space to (3,3).

Each step in the path is an adjacent cell to the previous step, and no walls are crossed. Therefore, this is a valid solution to the maze.
