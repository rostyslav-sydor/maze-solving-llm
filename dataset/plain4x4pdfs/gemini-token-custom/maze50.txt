<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
- Starting from the <ORIGIN_START> at (0,0), we follow the adjacency list to reach (0,1) and then (0,2)

- From (0,2), we can only go to (1,2) or (0,3). Since the target is at (3,3), we choose to go to (0,3).
 From (0,3), we can go to (1,3). 

- From (1,3), we can go to (2,3). 

- From (2,3), we can go to (2,2). 

- From (2,2), we can go to (3,2). 

- From (3,2), we can go to (3,1). 

- From (3,1), we can go to (2,1). 

- From (2,1), we can go to (3,1). 

- Finally, from (3,1), we can go to (3,2) and reach the <TARGET_END> at (3,3).

**Checking the path:**

We check that the path does not cross any walls by ensuring that each consecutive pair of cells in the path is adjacent in the adjacency list. We also check that the path uses only adjacent cells by ensuring that each consecutive pair of cells in the path shares an edge.
- (0,0) and (0,1) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (0,2) and (0,3) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (1,3) and (2,3) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (2,3) and (2,2) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (2,2) and (3,2) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (3,2) and (3,1) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (3,1) and (2,1) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (2,1) and (3,1) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent in the adjacency list.
- (3,2) and (3,3) are adjacent in the adjacency list.

Therefore, the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
