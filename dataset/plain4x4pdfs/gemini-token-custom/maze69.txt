<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution was found by performing a depth-first search from the origin to the target, while keeping track of the path taken.

Starting from the origin at (0,0), we first move to (0,1), then to (0,2), then to (0,3), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), and finally to (3,3), the target.

At each step, we check that the next move is valid, i.e. that the cell is adjacent to the current cell and that it is not a wall.

Once we reach the target, we backtrack to find the path from the origin to the target.

The path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells because at each step we check that the next move is valid.
