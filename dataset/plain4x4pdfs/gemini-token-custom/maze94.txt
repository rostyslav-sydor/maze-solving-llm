The maze is represented as an adjacency list. In order to find a path from the origin to the target, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). This algorithm is based on the idea of exploring all the possible paths from the origin, one step at a time, until the target is reached.

We start by creating a queue of nodes to visit. The queue is initially empty. We then add the origin node to the queue and mark it as visited.
We then loop until the queue is empty.
For each node in the queue, we add all of its adjacent nodes to the queue, if they have not been visited already. We also mark each adjacent node as visited.
If the target node is in the queue, we stop the loop and return the path from the origin to the target.
Otherwise, we continue looping until the queue is empty.
If the queue is empty and the target node has not been found, then there is no path from the origin to the target.

Here is the path from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>


This path does not cross any walls, and it uses only adjacent cells. Therefore, it is a valid solution to the maze.
