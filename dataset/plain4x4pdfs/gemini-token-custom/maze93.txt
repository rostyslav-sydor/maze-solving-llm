<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is a valid solution to the maze because it does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.

We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1).
From (0,1) we can move either up to (1,1) or right to (0,2).
We choose to move right to (0,2).
From (0,2) we can move either up to (1,2) or right to (0,3).
We choose to move right to (0,3).
From (0,3) we can move either up to (1,3) or right to (0,4).
We choose to move up to (1,3).
From (1,3) we can move either left to (0,3) or right to (2,3).
We choose to move right to (2,3).
From (2,3) we can move either left to (1,3) or down to (3,3).
We choose to move down to (3,3).
From (3,3) we can move either left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).
We choose to move left to (2,3).
From (2,3) we can move either up to (1,3) or left to (1,2).
We choose to move left to (1,2).
From (1,2) we can move either down to (2,2) or left to (0,2).
We choose to move left to (0,2).
From (0,2) we can move either up to (1,2) or left to (0,1).
We choose to move left to (0,1).
From (0,1) we can move either up to (1,1) or left to (0,0).
We choose to move left to (0,0).
From (0,0) we have reached the target (3,3).
