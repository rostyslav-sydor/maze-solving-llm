The path starts at the origin cell `(0,0)` and ends at the target cell `(3,3)`. We can use depth-first search (DFS) to find a path between the origin and the target.

1. Start at the origin cell `(0,0)`.
2. Visit the unvisited neighbor cells in the following order:
   - `(1,0)`
   - `(0,1)`
   - `(1,1)`
   - `(2,1)`
   - `(3,1)`
   - `(2,2)`
   - `(3,2)`
   - `(2,3)`
   - `(3,3)`
3. If the target cell `(3,3)` is visited, then the path is found. Otherwise, backtrack to the previous cell and visit the next unvisited neighbor cell.

The path found using DFS is:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

To check if the path does not cross any walls, we can check if each cell in the path is adjacent to the previous cell. The adjacency list shows that each cell in the path is adjacent to the previous cell, so the path does not cross any walls.

To check if the path uses only adjacent cells, we can check if each cell in the path is adjacent to the next cell. The adjacency list shows that each cell in the path is adjacent to the next cell, so the path uses only adjacent cells.
