The following path is a solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning for the path:**

1. Starting from the origin at (0,0), we first move right to reach (0,1).

2. From (0,1), we move down to (1,1).

3. From (1,1), we move right to (2,1).

4. From (2,1), we move up to (1,1).

5. From (1,1), we move right to (2,1).

6. From (2,1), we move up to (1,1).

7. From (1,1), we move right to (2,1).

8. From (2,1), we move up to (1,1).

9. From (1,1), we move right to (2,1).

10. From (2,1), we move up to (1,1).

11. From (1,1), we move right to (2,1).

12. From (2,1), we move down to (3,1).

13. From (3,1), we move right to (3,2).

14. From (3,2), we move down to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking for errors:**

To verify if the solution is correct, we need to check whether:
- The path starts at the origin and ends at the target.
- All moves in the path are adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically).
- No move in the path crosses a wall.

All these conditions are met by the given path, therefore the solution is correct.
