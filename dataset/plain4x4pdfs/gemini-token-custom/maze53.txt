<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move right to (1,2).
5. Move up to (1,1).
6. Move right to (1,2).
7. Move down to (1,3).
8. Move right to (2,3).
9. Move up to (1,3).
10. Move right to (2,3).
11. Move down to (3,3).

**Checking the solution:**

1. Verify that the path does not cross any walls.
   - All the moves are between adjacent cells, so the path does not cross any walls.
2. Verify that the path starts from the origin point (0,0) and ends at the target point (3,3).
   - The path starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,3), so it satisfies the requirement.

Therefore, the solution is valid.
