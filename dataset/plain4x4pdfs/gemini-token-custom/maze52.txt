<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution is found by traversing the maze from the starting point to the ending point while adhering to the following rules:

1. At each step, move to an adjacent cell that has not been visited before.
2. If there are multiple adjacent cells that have not been visited, choose the one that is closest to the ending point.
3. If there are no adjacent cells that have not been visited, backtrack to the most recent visited cell that has an unvisited adjacent cell.

By following these rules, we can find a path from the starting point to the ending point without crossing any walls or using any non-adjacent cells.
