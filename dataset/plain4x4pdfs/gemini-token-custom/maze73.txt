<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

1. Start from the origin cell, which is (0,0) in this case, and add it to the path.
2. From the current cell, explore all adjacent cells that are not walls. In this case, the adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
3. Since (1,0) is a wall, we can ignore it. Add (0,1) and (1,1) to the path.
4. From (1,1), explore all adjacent cells that are not walls. In this case, the adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,1).
5. Since (0,1) and (1,0) are already in the path, we can ignore them. Add (1,2) and (2,1) to the path.
6. From (2,1), explore all adjacent cells that are not walls. In this case, the adjacent cells are (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), and (3,1).
7. Since (1,1) is already in the path, we can ignore it. Add (2,0), (2,2), and (3,1) to the path.
8. From (3,1), explore all adjacent cells that are not walls. In this case, the adjacent cells are (2,1), (3,0), and (3,2).
9. Since (2,1) is already in the path, we can ignore it. Add (3,0) and (3,2) to the path.
10. From (3,2), explore all adjacent cells that are not walls. In this case, the adjacent cells are (2,2), (3,1), and (3,3).
11. Since (2,2) and (3,1) are already in the path, we can ignore them. Add (3,3) to the path.

The final path is: (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

Let's check if the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.

1. (0,0) and (0,1) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.
2. (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.
3. (0,2) and (0,3) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.
4. (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.
5. (1,3) and (2,3) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.
6. (2,3) and (3,3) are adjacent and there is no wall between them.

Therefore, the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
