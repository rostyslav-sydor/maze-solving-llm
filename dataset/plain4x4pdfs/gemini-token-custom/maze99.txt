<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Let's break down the reasoning behind this path:

**Adjacency List Overview**:
The provided adjacency list describes the connections between nodes in a grid-like structure. Each pair of coordinates represents a node in the grid, and the connected pairs indicate that the corresponding nodes are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).

**Starting and Ending Nodes**:
The origin and target nodes are marked as (0,0) and (3,3) respectively. Our path must start from (0,0) and end at (3,3).

**Finding a Path**:
Starting from the origin node (0,0), we follow the connections in the adjacency list to find a path that leads to the target node (3,3).

Starting from (0,0), we can move right to (0,1), then right again to (0,2), and finally down to (0,3). From (0,3), we can move right to (1,3), and then up to (2,3). Finally, we can move right one last time to reach the target node (3,3).

**Checking for Validity**:
1. **No Wall Crossings**: The path does not cross any walls, as it only moves along the edges of the grid and follows the connections specified in the adjacency list.
2. **Adjacent Cells**: The path only uses adjacent cells.

Therefore, the path <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> is a valid solution that connects the starting and ending nodes without crossing any walls or using non-adjacent cells.
