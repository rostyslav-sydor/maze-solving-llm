<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move right to (2,1).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move right to (3,2).
7. Move up to (3,1).
8. Move right to (3,3), the target.

**Checking for validity:**

1. The path does not cross any walls, as it only moves along edges in the adjacency list.
2. The path only uses adjacent cells, as each move is to a cell that is adjacent to the previous cell.
