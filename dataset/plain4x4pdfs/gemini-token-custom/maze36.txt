<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

- Starting from the entry point (0,0), we move right to (0,1).
- From (0,1), we move right again to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we move right once more to (0,3).
- From (0,3), we move up to (1,3).
- From (1,3), we move right to (2,3).
- Finally, from (2,3), we move up to the exit point (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution to the maze.
