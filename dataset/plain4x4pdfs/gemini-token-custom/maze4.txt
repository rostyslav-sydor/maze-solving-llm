**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Continue moving right to (2,0).
4. Move down to (3,0).
5. Move right to (3,1).
6. Move down to (3,2).
7. Finally, move right to (3,3), which is the target point.

**Checking Solution:**

1. Check if the path crosses any walls: No, the path does not cross any walls because it only moves in the right or down directions, which are the allowed directions.
2. Check if the path uses only adjacent cells: Yes, the path uses only adjacent cells because every move is either one step right or one step down.
