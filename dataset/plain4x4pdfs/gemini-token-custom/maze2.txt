The solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0).

2. Follow the path to the right, reaching (0,1)

3. Follow the path to the right again, reaching (0,2)

4. Then, follow the path up to (0,3)

5. Follow the path to the right again, reaching (1,3)

6. Then, follow the path up to (2,3)

7. Finally, follow the path to the right to reach the target (3,3).

This path uses only adjacent cells and does not cross any walls.
