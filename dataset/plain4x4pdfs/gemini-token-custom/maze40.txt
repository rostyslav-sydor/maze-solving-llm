<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Move to the adjacent cell (0,1).
3. Move to the adjacent cell (0,2).
4. Move to the adjacent cell (0,3).
5. Move to the adjacent cell (1,3).
6. Move to the adjacent cell (2,3).
7. Move to the adjacent cell (3,3), which is the target point.

**Checking if the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells:**

1. Each movement is to an adjacent cell, so the path uses only adjacent cells.
2. The path does not cross any walls because there is an edge between each consecutive pair of coordinates in the path.
