**SOLUTION**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**REASONING**

1. Start from the origin (0,0) and move to (0,1) since it is the only adjacent cell.
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2) since it is the only adjacent cell.
3. From (0,2), move to (1,2) since it is the only adjacent cell.
4. From (1,2), move to (1,3) since it is the only adjacent cell.
5. From (1,3), move back to (1,2) since it is the only adjacent cell.
6. From (1,2), move to (2,2) since it is the only adjacent cell.
7. From (2,2), move to (3,2) since it is the only adjacent cell.
8. Finally, from (3,2), move to (3,3) which is the target.

**CHECKING**

1. The path does not cross any walls because each move is between adjacent cells.
2. The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is between adjacent cells.
