<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

- Starting from the entry point (0,0), we move right to (1,0), and then up to (1,1).
- From (1,1), we move right to (1,2), and then up to (1,3).
- From (1,3), we move right to (2,3), and then up to (3,3), which is the exit point.

**Checking for validity:**

- The path does not cross any walls, as each step is from an adjacent cell.
- The path only uses adjacent cells, as each step is either a move to the right or up.
