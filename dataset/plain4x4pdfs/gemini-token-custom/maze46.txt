To solve the maze, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
We start at the origin cell and recursively explore all adjacent cells until we reach the target cell.
If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different path.

Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:

We start at the origin cell (0,0).
We explore the adjacent cell (0,1) and find that it leads to the target cell (3,3).
We backtrack and explore the adjacent cell (0,2) and find that it leads to a dead end.
We backtrack and explore the adjacent cell (0,3) and find that it leads to the target cell (3,3).
We backtrack and explore the adjacent cell (1,3) and find that it leads to the target cell (3,3).
We backtrack and explore the adjacent cell (2,3) and find that it leads to the target cell (3,3).
We backtrack and explore the adjacent cell (3,3) and find that it is the target cell.

We have found a path from the origin cell to the target cell.
The path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
