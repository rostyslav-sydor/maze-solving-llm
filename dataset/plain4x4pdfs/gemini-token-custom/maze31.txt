<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

First, we need to identify the starting and destination points of the maze. The starting point is marked with the <ORIGIN_START> token and the destination point is marked with the <TARGET_START> token. In this maze, the starting point is (0,0) and the destination point is (3,3).

Next, we need to find a path from the starting point to the destination point. We can do this by using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. In this case, we will use a DFS algorithm.

Starting at the origin, the DFS algorithm will explore all of the possible paths from the starting point to the destination point. The algorithm will backtrack if it reaches a dead end.

The DFS algorithm will continue to explore all of the possible paths until it finds a path to the destination point. In this case, the DFS algorithm will find a path to the destination point that is (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

Finally, we need to check if the path found by the DFS algorithm does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells. In this case, the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution to this maze is <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
