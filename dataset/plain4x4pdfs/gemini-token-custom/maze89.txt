From the <ORIGIN_START> token we can only go to cell (0,1) because there is a wall to the adjacent cell (1,0).
From cell (0,1) we can go to cell (0,2) or (1,1). Choosing (0,2) is a dead end, so we go to cell (1,1) instead.
From cell (1,1) we can go to cell (1,2) or (2,1). Choosing (2,1) is a dead end, so we go to cell (1,2).
From cell (1,2) we can go to cell (0,2) or (2,2). Both options are dead ends.
From the <TARGET_START> token we can go to cell (3,2) or (3,1). Choosing (3,1) is a dead end, so we go to cell (3,2).
From cell (3,2) we can go to cell (3,1) or (2,2). Both options are dead ends.
From cell (2,2) we can go to cell (2,1) or (1,2). Choosing (2,1) is a dead end, so we go to cell (1,2).
From cell (1,2) we can go to cell (0,2) or (2,2). Both options are dead ends.
From cell (0,2) we can go to cell (0,1) or (1,2). Choosing (1,2) is a dead end, so we go to cell (0,1).
From cell (0,1) we can go to cell (1,1) or (0,0). Choosing (0,0) is a dead end, so we go to cell (1,1).
From cell (1,1) we can go to cell (1,0) or (2,1). Choosing (1,0) is a dead end, so we go to cell (2,1).
From cell (2,1) we can go to cell (2,2) or (3,1). Choosing (3,1) is a dead end, so we go to cell (2,2).
From cell (2,2) we can go to cell (2,3) or (3,2). Choosing (3,2) is a dead end, so we go to cell (2,3).
From cell (2,3) we can go to cell (1,3) or (3,3). Choosing (1,3) is a dead end, so we go to cell (3,3).

The final solution is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
