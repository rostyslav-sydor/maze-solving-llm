One possible solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution is valid because it starts at the origin, ends at the target, and only uses adjacent cells. It also does not cross any walls.

To find this solution, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. Starting at the origin, we explore all possible paths until we reach the target. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different path.

This algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. However, it is not guaranteed to find the shortest solution.
