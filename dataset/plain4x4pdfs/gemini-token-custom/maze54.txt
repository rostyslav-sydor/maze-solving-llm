From the given adjacency list, we can observe that there are two possible paths:

1. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
2. (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Both of these paths use only adjacent cells and do not cross any walls, so they are both valid solutions. 

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
