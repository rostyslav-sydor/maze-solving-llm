<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>


**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin point (0,0), we move right to (1,0), then down to (1,1). From there, we move right to (2,1), then down to (3,1). We continue moving right to (3,2), and finally up to the target point (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls because we only move between adjacent cells that are connected by an edge in the adjacency list. We also never leave the boundaries of the maze.
