This maze is solved in the following way:
Start from origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0)
Move down to (1,1)
Move right to (2,1)
Move down to (2,2)
Move right to (3,2)
Move down to (3,3)

This results in the path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To check validity, let's iterate over the list and make sure each entry is connected to the previous one in the list.

(0,0) can be connected to (0,1) or (1,0)
(1,0) can be connected to (0,0) or (1,1)
(1,1) can be connected to (1,0) or (1,2) or (0,1)
(2,1) can be connected to (2,0) or (2,2) or (1,1)
(2,2) can be connected to (2,1) or (2,3) or (3,2) or (1,2)
(3,2) can be connected to (3,1) or (3,3) or (2,2)
(3,3) can be connected to (3,2) or (2,3)

We can see that each entry in the list is adjacent to the previous one in the list.

Therefore, the solution is valid and does not cross any walls or uses non-adjacent cells.
