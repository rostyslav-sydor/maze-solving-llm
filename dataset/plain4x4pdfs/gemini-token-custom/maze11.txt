To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from the entry point, we explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point. Here's the step-by-step solution:

- Start at the entry point (0,0).
- Visit the adjacent cell (1,0), which is not visited yet.
- Visit the adjacent cell (2,0), which is not visited yet.
- Visit the adjacent cell (3,0), which is not visited yet.
- Visit the adjacent cell (3,1), which is not visited yet.
- Visit the adjacent cell (3,2), which is not visited yet.
- Visit the adjacent cell (3,3), which is the exit point.

The path from the entry point to the exit point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We can verify that this solution is correct by checking that it does not cross any walls and that it only uses adjacent cells.

- It does not cross any walls because each step in the path is to an adjacent cell, and there are no walls between adjacent cells.
- It only uses adjacent cells because each step in the path is to a cell that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the previous cell.
