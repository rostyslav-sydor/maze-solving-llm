<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Find the origin and target coordinates from the given maze.
2. Start from the origin coordinate and explore all adjacent cells in a depth-first manner.
3. Mark the cells that have been visited and add them to the path.
4. Continue exploring until the target coordinate is reached.
5. Check that the path does not cross any walls.
6. Check that the path uses only adjacent cells.

This solution satisfies all the conditions and provides a valid path from the origin to the target.
