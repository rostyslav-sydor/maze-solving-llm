To find the solution to this maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the origin and explores all of the adjacent cells, then all of the cells adjacent to those cells, and so on. This process continues until the target is reached.

In this case, the origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). Starting at (0,0), we can explore the following cells:

(1,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(2,0)

From these cells, we can explore the following cells:

(2,1)
(1,1)
(1,2)
(0,3)
(3,0)
(3,1)

From these cells, we can explore the following cells:

(3,2)
(2,2)
(2,3)
(1,3)

Finally, we reach the target cell (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To check if this solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells, we can check each pair of adjacent cells in the solution to make sure that they are adjacent. In this case, all of the pairs of adjacent cells in the solution are adjacent, so the solution is valid.
