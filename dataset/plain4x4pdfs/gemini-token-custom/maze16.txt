Let's start from the <ORIGIN_START> token and find a path to the <TARGET_END> token.

We can start by moving right from (0,0) to (0,1). Then, we can move down to (1,1). From there, we can move right to (1,2) and then up to (0,2). We can then move right to (1,2) and then down to (2,2). We can then move right to (3,2) and then up to (2,1). We can then move right to (3,1) and then down to (2,0). We can then move right to (3,0) and then up to (2,1). We can then move right to (3,1) and then down to (2,2). We can then move right to (3,2) and then up to (2,3). We can then move right to (3,3) which is the <TARGET_END> token.

The path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (2,1) (3,1) (2,0) (3,0) (2,1) (3,1) (2,2) (3,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
