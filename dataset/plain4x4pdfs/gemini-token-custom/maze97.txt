A possible path through this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path begins at the origin (0,0) and moves right to (1,0). It then moves down to (2,0) and continues right to (3,0). From there, it moves down to (3,1), then right to (3,2), and finally up to the target (3,3).

Each step in this path is adjacent to the previous step, and none of the steps cross any walls. Therefore, this path is a valid solution to the maze.
