1. We start from the entry point represented as <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and add it to the path.
2. From (0,0) we can move to (0,1) or (0,2). We choose (0,1) and add it to the path.
3. From (0,1) we can move to (0,2) or (1,1). We choose (0,2) and add it to the path.
4. From (0,2) we can move to (0,3) or (1,2). We choose (0,3) and add it to the path.
5. From (0,3) we can move to (1,3) or (2,3). We choose (1,3) and add it to the path.
6. From (1,3) we can move to (2,3) or (3,3). We choose (2,3) and add it to the path.
7. From (2,3) we can move to (3,3) or (3,2). We choose (3,3) and add it to the path.
8. We have reached the exit point represented as <TARGET_END> (3,3).

The solution is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Let's check if our solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells:

Checking if the path does not cross any walls:
- (0,0) to (0,1) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.
- (0,1) to (0,2) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.
- (0,2) to (0,3) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.
- (0,3) to (1,3) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.
- (1,3) to (2,3) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.
- (2,3) to (3,3) is a valid move, there is an edge between them.

Checking if the path uses only adjacent cells:
- (0,0) and (0,1) are adjacent cells.
- (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent cells.
- (0,2) and (0,3) are adjacent cells.
- (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent cells.
- (1,3) and (2,3) are adjacent cells.
- (2,3) and (3,3) are adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution is valid and does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
