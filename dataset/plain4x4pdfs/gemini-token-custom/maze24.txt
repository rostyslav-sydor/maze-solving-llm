<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

1. Find the starting vertex from the <ORIGIN_START> token
2. Find all reachable vertices from the starting one. They are (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
3. Find the path from the starting vertex to the <TARGET_START> vertex (3,3) using Breath first search(BFS) traversal algorithm and record the path 
4. Check that result path does not contain any walls and that all coordinates uses only adjacent cells.

1. (0,0)
2. (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
3. (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)
4. All coordinates in the path are adjacent (each two differs by 1 either in row or column coordinate) and there are no walls in the path.
