To find a path through the maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. Starting at the origin, we can recursively explore each of its adjacent cells until we reach the target.

Here is one possible solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We can verify that this solution is valid by checking that it does not cross any walls and that each step is to an adjacent cell.

- (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0)
- (1,0) is adjacent to (1,1)
- (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2)
- (1,2) is adjacent to (1,3)
- (1,3) is adjacent to (2,3)
- (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3)

Therefore, this solution is valid.
