Starting from entry point <ORIGIN_START> (0,0), we can reach cell (1,1) by moving right (<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <--> (1,0) ;). From (1,1) we can move one cell down to reach (1,2) (<ADJLIST_END> (1,1) <--> (1,2) ;). 

From (1,2) we can move two cells right to reach (3,2) (<ADJLIST_END> (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; <ADJLIST_END> (2,2) <--> (3,2) ;). 

From (3,2) we can move one cell up to reach (3,1) (<ADJLIST_END> (3,2) <--> (3,1) ;) and then one cell to the right to reach exit point (3,3) (<ADJLIST_END> (3,1) <--> (3,3) ;).

So, the solution for provided maze is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Checking if the solution does not pass through any walls and cells are adjacent to each other:

(0,0) is adjacent to (1,0) as per adjacency list definition
(1,0) is adjacent to (1,1) as per adjacency list definition
(1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) as per adjacency list definition
(1,2) is adjacent to (2,2) as per adjacency list definition
(2,2) is adjacent to (3,2) as per adjacency list definition
(3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) as per adjacency list definition
(3,1) is adjacent to (3,3) as per adjacency list definition

Thus, the solution is valid and does not cross any walls.
