<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

- We start from the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
- From (1,0) we can only move down to (1,1).
- From (1,1) we move right to (1,2).
- From (1,2) we can only move down to (1,3).
- From (1,3) we move right to (2,3).
- From (2,3) we can only move down to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking for correctness:**

- We can check that the solution does not cross any walls by verifying that each consecutive pair of coordinates in the path is adjacent.
- We can check that the path uses only adjacent cells by verifying that each consecutive pair of coordinates in the path differs by at most 1 in either row or column.

Both of these checks are true for the given solution, so it is a valid solution to the maze.
