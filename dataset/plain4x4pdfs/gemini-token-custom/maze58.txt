<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move right to (2,1).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move right to (3,2).
7. Move down to (3,3).

**Checking the solution:**
1. The path does not cross any walls.
2. The path only uses adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution is correct.
