<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning Behind Calculations:

1. **Starting Point:** The maze begins at (0,0) as specified by <ORIGIN_START>.
2. **Follow Adjacency List:** The adjacency list provided outlines the connections:
   - (0,0) connects to (1,0), allowing a move south.
   - (1,0) links to (2,0), continuing south.
   - (2,0) has a link to (3,0), further south.
   - (3,0) has a link to (3,1) to the east.
   - Moving east to (3,1), it is connected to (3,2).
   - (3,2) links to (2,2) moving north.
   - From (2,2), move east to (2,3).
   - Lastly, from (2,3), go south to the target (3,3) as specified by <TARGET_START>.
   
### Path Verification:

- **No Walls Crossed:** Each step in the path is directly linked in the adjacency list, meaning there are no walls or barriers crossed.
- **Valid Adjacent Cell Movement:** Each transition moves to an adjacent cell either to the north, south, east, or west, ensuring the path is continuous and valid.

This solution ensures the path from the entry to the exit moves through interconnected cells only, adhering to the maze's rules, without any errors or backtracking.
