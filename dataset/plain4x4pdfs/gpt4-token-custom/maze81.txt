<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. **Starting Point:** The origin specified in the input is (0,0).

2. **Path Identification:**
    - From (0,0) to (1,0): There's a direct link between (1,0) <--> (0,0).
    - From (1,0) to (2,0): Again, a direct link is mentioned between (1,0) <--> (2,0).
    - From (2,0) to (3,0): As per the adjacency list, there exists a connection between (2,0) <--> (3,0).
    - From (3,0) to (3,1): A next step can proceed from (3,0) to (3,1), directly linked in the adjacency list.
    - From (3,1) to (3,2): Followed by a direct connection from (3,1) <--> (3,2).
    - From (3,2) to (3,3): Finally, a link from (3,2) <--> (3,3) completes the path to the target.

3. **Verification of Path:** Checking the path:
    - All movements are between directly connected vertices/nodes as defined in the input adjacency list, indicating all movements are valid and follow the rules of the maze.
    - The path is linear and direct, avoiding any cells that do not offer a direct connection to the sequential path movement toward the target (3,3).

4. **Conclusion:** The chosen path is valid based on the adjacency relationships provided and reaches the target as defined by the target tokens in the adjacency list input. Each pair in the sequence corresponds directly to an edge in the graph, confirming that there are no crossings through walls and only moves to adjacent cells are used.
