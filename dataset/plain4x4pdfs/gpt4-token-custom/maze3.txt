To solve this maze, I begin by taking the list of connections from the adjacency list and construct a dictionary where each key is a node (coordinate) in the maze, and the value is the list of direct neighbors of this node. Based on the adjacency list provided, I extract the maze structure as follows:

- (1,3) is connected to (0,3) and (2,3)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (3,1) is connected to (3,0) and (3,2)
- (3,2) is connected to (3,1), (3,3), and (2,2)
- (2,2) is connected to (2,3), (2,1), and (3,2)
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (1,2)
- (1,2) is connected to (0,2) and (1,3)
- (3,0) is connected to (2,0) and (3,1)
- (2,0) is connected to (2,1), (1,0), and (3,0)
- (2,1) is connected to (2,0) and (2,2)
- (1,1) is connected to (1,0)
- (1,0) is connected to (1,1), (0,0), and (2,0)

With the starting point as (0,0) and the target as (3,3), we need to find a path using these connections:

1. Start at origin (0,0): Neighbors - (0,1), (1,0)
2. Go to (1,0): Neighbors - (1,1), (2,0)
3. From (1,0), next is (2,0): Neighbors - (3,0), (2,1)
4. Move to (3,0): Neighbors - (3,1)
5. Go to (3,1): Neighbors - (3,2)
6. From there, proceed to (3,2): Neighbors - (3,3), (2,2)
7. Arrive at (3,3), which is the target location.

To check the feasibility:
- Each transition between coordinates involves direct neighbors based on the adjacency list provided.
- No walls are crossed, and all movement respects the connections given in the adjacency list.

Hence the valid solution for this path inside the maze, moving from origin to destination, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path uses only allowed adjacent cells making the pathway correct and adherent to the maze structure without crossing any inaccessible points or walls.
