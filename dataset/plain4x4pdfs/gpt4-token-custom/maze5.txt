To find a solution for the maze, I will interpret the given adjacency list as a representation of all available pathways between points in a grid. The goal is to find a route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

### Step 1: Understanding the Maze's Structure
From the adjacency list:
- The maze grid appears to be at least 4x4 due to coordinates ranging from (0,0) to (3,3).
- The list specifies the valid connections (pathways) between points, ensuring movement is allowed between them.

### Step 2: Mapping the Connections
The maze can be visualized based on adjacency points:
- Each pair indicates bi-directional movement between the points.
- We map these onto a typical x, y coordinate system where x and y are both between 0 and 3.

### Step 3: Plotting the Route
- Starting at (0,0), examine connections and follow a path that progressively advances towards (3,3) while ensuring each move is to a connected node:
1. From (0,0) move to (0,1) [going East]
2. From (0,1) move to (0,2) [going East]
3. From (0,2) move to (0,3) [going East]
4. From (0,3) move to (1,3) [going South]
5. From (1,3) move to (2,3) [going South]
6. From (2,3) move to (3,3) [going South]

### Step 4: Confirming the Solution
- Check if each step only moves between directly linked coordinates from the adjacency list:
  - (0,0) <--> (0,1)
  - (0,1) <--> (0,2)
  - (0,2) <--> (0,3)
  - (0,3) <--> (1,3)
  - (1,3) <--> (2,3)
  - (2,3) <--> (3,3)

This ensures that the path follows valid connections and does not go through any walls or disconnected areas.

### Step 5: Detailing the Path
Summarizing the route into the requested format showcases a clear movement from the start to the exit, covering a clear, linear pathway while following the possible moves defined by the adjacency list.

Hence the final path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path adequately represents a valid solution to the maze based on the data provided, leveraging only the connections enumerated, thus adhering to all maze constraints.
