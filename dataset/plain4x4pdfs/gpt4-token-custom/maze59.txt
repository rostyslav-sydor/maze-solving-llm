<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start from the origin (0,0) as specified.
2. The adjacency list shows node (0,0) is connected to (0,1) and (1,0); however, we move towards the target (3,3) to minimize backtracking.
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2); per the adjacency list, these nodes are directly connected.
4. Move from (0,2) to (0,3); again, direct connection via the adjacency list.
5. Now at (0,3), move to (1,3) since that is a connected node. This step heads south and aligns with our overall direction towards the target.
6. Next, move from (1,3) to (2,3). The adjacency list confirms that these nodes are connected.
7. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3), reaching the target. This path uses valid, adjacent connections directly aligned with connections listed in the adjacency list.

Verification that the path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent cells:
- Each step progresses to an adjacent cell connected directly via the adjacency list; no diagonal or non-listed movements are made.
- Reviewing the adjacency list connections versus the chosen path, all steps are legitimately connected, and thus no walls are crossed in the solution.
