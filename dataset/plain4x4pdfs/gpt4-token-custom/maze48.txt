To solve the maze, we first translate the adjacency list into a graph structure. Each coordinate pair represents a node, and the links between them are edges. This structure can be used to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) is effective for unweighted graphs like this maze as it guarantees the shortest path if one exists. BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

**Step-by-step Through The BFS Algorithm:**
1. Begin at the start node (0,0).
2. Explore all adjacent nodes. Queue each adjacent node and mark it as visited.
3. Dequeue a node as the current node and check its adjacency list; enqueue any connected nodes that haven't been visited.
4. Repeat until the target node (3,3) is reached or the queue is empty.

Applying BFS to your maze, here is how it will work:
- Start BFS from (0,0). Its adjacent node is (1,0).
- From (1,0), the adjacent nodes are (1,1) and (2,0).
- Continue this exploration:
  - From (1,1), move to (2,1).
  - From (2,1), move to (2,0) and (3,1).
  - From (3,1), moving further you can reach (3,2) and from there (3,3)

Since BFS explores layer-by-layer, the route discovered will be among the shortest possible routes without backtracking.

**Output Path:**
- The BFS traversal yields a path begin from (0,0), moving to (1,0), then to (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), and finally reaching (3,3).

**Solution Checking:**
- This path only moves between adjacent nodes based on the adjacency list.
- No moves between non-adjacent nodes are included in the path, thus not crossing any walls.

**Final Solution Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path verifies as a valid solution to the maze based on the adjacency list provided.
