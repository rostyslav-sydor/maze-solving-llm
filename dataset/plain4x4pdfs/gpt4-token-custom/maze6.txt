To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list which defines allowable paths between points, and then perform a search using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm since it helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

1. **Graph Interpretation**: The maze can be interpreted as an undirected graph where each node represents a coordinate and each edge suggests a direct path between two adjacent coordinates.

   For example:
   - Edge `(0,2) <--> (0,3)` suggests movement is possible between the cells (0,2) and (0,3).
   - The graph from the adjacency list describes an interconnected network where paths between cells that share an edge can be traversed.

2. **Origin and Target**: 
   - Origin (where we start) is at (0,0).
   - Target (where we need to reach) is at (3,3).

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - BFS is suitable here as it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, inherently finding the shortest path between the origin and the target in an unweighted graph like this.
   - From each node, BFS explores all edges emanating from it to visit other nodes until the target node is found.

4. **Path Finding**: Using BFS,
   - Start from the origin (0,0), adding it to our queue.
   - Expansion from (0,0) shows navigable paths to (0,1) following which (0,2) and then (0,3) becomes reachable.
   - Continue this process: moving in the maze as per adjacency connections, making sure to mark nodes visited.
   - Upon reaching the target (3,3), the path taken can be tracked back using a predecessor array or similar structure filled during BFS execution.

5. **Validating the Path**:
   - The presumed correct path would be from BFS is `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`.
   - Check that each consecutive coordinate pair in this path matches an edge in the adjacency list, confirming there is no movement through walls.
   - Additionally, make sure that each step between coordinates is either to an adjacent row or an adjacent column, with no diagonal movements unless explicitly stated in adjacency.

6. **Cross-check**:
   - Validate this generated path strictly follows the adjacency relations specified, ensuring they are adjacent cells.

Considering the information presented:
- There are no explicit restrictions or obstructions beyond the adjacency described.
- The BFS based on these connections will ensure the shortest path, given the structure.

Result:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path adheres strictly to the adjacency list rules, shows correct grid neighbor movement, and achieves the target as defined.
