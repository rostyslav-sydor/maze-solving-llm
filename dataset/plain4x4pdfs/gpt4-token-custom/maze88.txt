To solve the maze described in the problem, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using the adjacency list given. The list defines which cells in the maze are directly connected (i.e., which moves are possible from one cell to another without crossing walls).

**Starting Point:** (0,0)  
**Ending Point:** (3,3)  

Here is the adjacency list simplified into pairs of connected nodes:
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)

**Finding a Path:**
- We start at (0,0).
- Moving from (0,0) to (1,0) (connected).
- From (1,0) to (2,0) (connected).
- From (2,0) to (3,0) (connected).
- From (3,0) to (3,1) (connected).
- From (3,1) to (3,2) (connected).
- From (3,2) to (3,3) (connected).

This path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) adheres to the adjacency list, maintaining connections explicitly defined between nodes.

**Output Path Format:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Validation:**
Now, we check that each step of the solution path uses only adjacent cells and adheres to the adjacency relationships specified:

- From (0,0) to (1,0), from (1,0) to (2,0), from (2,0) to (3,0): moves vertically directly connected.
- From (3,0) to (3,1), from (3,1) to (3,2), from (3,2) to (3,3): moves horizontally directly connected.

This path covers allowed connections without crossing any walls, as it progresses sequentially through directly connected nodes, confirming it as a valid solution.
