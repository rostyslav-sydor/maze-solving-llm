To solve the given maze, represented as an adjacency list, we'll interpret the graph, find the shortest path from the origin to the target using a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), and then verify that the solution path is valid through adjacent connections only.

**Step 1: Interpreting the Graph**
The given adjacency list specifies which cells are directly connected. Each pair has bi-directional connectivity. Here's the parsed graph:
- (3,3) ↔ (2,3)
- (0,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (0,3) ↔ (0,2)
- (1,2) ↔ (1,1)
- (1,0) ↔ (1,1)
- (2,2) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,2) ↔ (3,1)
- (2,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (2,0) ↔ (3,0)
- (2,0) ↔ (1,0)
- (0,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (2,0) ↔ (2,1)
- (3,2) ↔ (3,3)
- (0,1) ↔ (1,1)
- (3,1) ↔ (2,1)
- (0,1) ↔ (0,0)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,2)

The origin is `(0,0)` and the target is `(3,3)`.

**Step 2: Finding a Path**
To find the shortest path from origin to target:
1. Start at `(0,0)`.
2. Use BFS, exploring all neighbors breadth-first.

Here’s an illustration of BFS steps:
- Start at `(0,0)`, neighbours: `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, neighbours: `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, neighbours: `(0,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,0)`.
- From `(1,0)`, reconnect to `(1,1)`.
- Next, from `(1,2)`, neighbours: `(1,1)`, `(0,2)`.
- From `(0,2)`, neighbours: `(0,3)`, `(1,2)`.
- From `(0,3)`, neighbours: `(0,2)`, `(1,3)`.
- From `(1,3)`, neighbours: `(0,3)`, `(2,3)`.
- From `(2,3)`, neighbours: `(1,3)`, `(3,3)`.

Reach destination `(3,3)` from `(2,3)`.

**Step 3: Validating the Solution**
Trace the path found by BFS and ensure all steps are through valid adjacent connections:

Path: `(0,0) -> (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)`

Each step in this path corresponds with a connection in the adjacency list. There are no leaps across non-connected cells, and the path uses only adjacent connected cells.

**Final Step: Output the Path**
Correct path as per BFS and adjacent cell validation:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
