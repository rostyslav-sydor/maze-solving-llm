First, understanding the maze from the input adjacency list requires breaking down each connection provided between coordinates. This adjacency list is essentially an edge list of an undirected graph where each node represents a coordinate in the maze, and each edge indicates that there is a direct, traversable path between two coordinates.

Given the structure and relationships in the adjacency list, we need to construct a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. The list of all connections (edges) from the adjacency list are:

```
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
```

Starting from the origin `(0,0)`, we are to find a routable path to `(3,3)`:

1. Begin at `(0,0)`. The adjacent vertex available from the list is `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, we can move to `(0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, we can then move to `(0,3)`.
4. At `(0,3)`, one available path goes to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)`, the previous link takes us backward to `(1,2)`.
6. Next, from `(1,2)`, go to `(2,2)`.
7. From `(2,2)`, the path leads to `(3,2)`.
8. At `(3,2)`, continue to `(3,3)`, the target point.

Thus, the steps can be summarized as moving through the coordinates: `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)`.

Since we followed the direct connections provided by the adjacency list, ensuring each move was legal (connected directly in the list), the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent and directly connected cells. Rechecking the provided path, we can see that every move from one coordinate to the next is allowed according to the list, confirming the validity of the path.

Finally, we represent the valid solution between the demand <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
