<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. **Start point**: (0,0)
2. For (0,0) the possible next positions according to the adjacency list are (1,0).

3. From (1,0) it connects to (2,0).

4. Next, (2,0) can clearly reach through (2,1).

5. From (2,1), it logically moves to (2,2).

6. (2,2) has connection to (2,3), thus following that lead.

7. At (2,3), we can reach (1,3).

8. From (1,3) there's an option to move to (0,3).

9. From (0,3) we're able to progress to (0,2).

10. Then from (0,2) to (0,1).
   
11. Moving from (0,1) to (1,1).

12. From (1,1) you can move to (1,2).

13. (1,2) connects back to (1,3).

14. (1,3) connects to (2,3) once again as another viable path.

15. Finally, (2,3) connects to (3,3), the target.

**Validation**:
- All given paths between points are directly connected according to the adjacency list, ensuring no path breaks through walls or uses non-adjacent cells.
- The path successfully starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3).
- Each step moves to an adjacent coordinate as permitted by the maze's structure.
