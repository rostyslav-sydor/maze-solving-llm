<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. From the adjacency list, each pair of coordinates were evaluated to create a grid layout of the maze:
   ```
   (0,0) <-> (0,1)
   (0,1) <-> (1,1)
   (1,1) <-> (1,2)
   (1,2) <-> (1,3)
   (1,3) <-> (2,3)
   (2,3) <-> (3,3)
   ```
   This establishes connections between adjacent cells without any barriers.

2. The path starts at the origin (0,0) and must reach the target (3,3).
   
3. Step-by-step analysis:
   - From (0,0) to (0,1) because (0,0) connects to (0,1).
   - Next, move vertically to (1,1) since (0,1) -> (1,1).
   - Continue moving from (1,1) to (1,2) and then to (1,3), following the connections provided in the list.
   - Move vertically up from (1,3) to (2,3).
   - Finally, move further up to (3,3) to reach the target.

4. All the moves are directly taken from the adjacency relationships given, without crossing through any points that arenâ€™t explicitly connected.

Checking:
- Confirm the cells along the proposed path are directly connected in the adjacency list:
  - (0,0) <-> (0,1)
  - (0,1) <-> (1,1)
  - (1,1) <-> (1,2)
  - (1,2) <-> (1,3)
  - (1,3) <-> (2,3)
  - (2,3) <-> (3,3)
  
All these connections exist, confirming the path is correct and follows available routes without crossing through walls. The cells are adjacent vertically or horizontally reflecting typical maze traversal and satisfy the given maze's adjacency structure.
