<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind the Calculation:**

1. **Start from the Origin:** The maze starts at (0,0).

2. **Analyze Adjacent List Connections:**
   - From (0,0), the only connection is to (1,0).
   - (1,0) connects further to (2,0).
   - (2,0) connects forward to (3,0).
 
3. **Strategy - Follow the Bottom Route:**
   - From (3,0), move East to the connected node (3,1).
   - Proceed from (3,1) to (3,2).
   - Lastly, from (3,2) move to the target, which is (3,3).

**Checking Correctness and Validity:**
   - All proposed steps in the path use only the adjacently listed coordinates in the given adjacency list.
   - The path does not backtrack or cross any non-existent routes and strictly follows valid connections.

**Conclusion:**
This path progresses linearly from the leftmost bottom of the maze grid towards the right, navigating through valid and directly connected paths, thereby ensuring each step is legitimate and reaches the exit most directly without any breaches in traversing non-connected paths.
