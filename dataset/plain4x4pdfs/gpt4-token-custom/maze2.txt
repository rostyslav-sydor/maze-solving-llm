<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. From the adjacency list, we infer the valid connections between each coordinate pair. The maze's entry point is given as (0,0) and exit at (3,3).
2. Starting from (0,0), the adjacency list allows a move to (1,0).
3. From (1,0), we can go to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), the next valid move according to the list is to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), we can go to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), proceed to (2,3).
7. Finally, from (2,3), we reach the exit at (3,3).

Validation:
- Each step uses only directly connected spaces as per the adjacency list.
- The path does not backtrack or violate any constraints provided.
- Each space is adjacent to the previous one, ensuring no walls are crossed unlawfully.
