<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. **Graph Interpretation**:
   - Starting from (0,0), we need to reach (3,3) navigating through the given edges.

2. **Listing Connections**:
   - (0,0) connects to (0,1).
   - (0,1) connects to (0,2) and vice versa.
   - (0,2) connects to (1,2) and vice versa.
   - (1,2) connects to (1,3) and vice versa.
   - (1,3) connects to (2,3) and vice versa.
   - (2,3) connects to (3,3).

3. **Optimal Path Identification**:
   - Following adjacent nodes from the starting point (0,0) while avoiding dead ends or cycles using the connections above, you traverse through each connection only once to get to the goal.

4. **Wall Crossing and Adherence to Adjacencies**:
   - At each step, we have verified that movement is between directly connected nodes without crossing any walls or non-connected nodes, ensuring that the path respects the graphâ€™s adjacency constraints, i.e., each move is to an adjacent and connected node.

This path reaches the desired end point (3,3) using only valid and adjacent connections throughout the traversal.
