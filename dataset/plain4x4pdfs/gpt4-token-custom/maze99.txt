To solve the maze, I've analyzed the adjacency list you provided and traced a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using connectivity between nodes as given:

1. Start at the origin (0,0), can move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is the target.

All steps move to directly connected nodes, hence fulfilling the requirement that the path should only move between adjacent cells in the maze. Each move is verified against the adjacency list ensuring there is a direct link between each pair of coordinates in the solution path with no walls crossed. Now, output the formatted solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence allows passage from the origin to the target without crossing any obstructed paths. Each transition explicitly exists in the adjacency list, demonstrating its validity and adherence to the maze's rules.
