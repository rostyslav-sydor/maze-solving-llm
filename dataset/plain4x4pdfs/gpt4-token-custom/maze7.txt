To find a solution to the maze, we first need to understand how the adjacency list describes the graph of the maze. Each pair of coordinates mentioned shows that there is a direct pathway (no wall) between the two points. Our starting point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3).

We'll follow each possible path from the origin to the destination, making sure we only travel along the connections given in the adjacency list, and we choose a valid path that takes us from start to finish.

Given the adjacency list:

(3,1) <--> (2,1); (2,0) <--> (3,0); (2,3) <--> (1,3); (2,2) <--> (3,2); (1,0) <--> (1,1); (0,3) <--> (0,2); (3,3) <--> (3,2); (3,2) <--> (3,1); (2,1) <--> (2,2); (0,0) <--> (1,0); (0,2) <--> (0,1); (2,2) <--> (2,3); (1,1) <--> (1,2); (0,2) <--> (1,2); (3,1) <--> (3,0); (0,3) <--> (1,3); (1,0) <--> (2,0); (0,0) <--> (0,1);

The solution path can be traced out as:
1. Start at (0,0), allowed moves to (1,0) and to (0,1).
2. From (0,0) to (1,0). Next possible moves to (1,1) or connect to (2,0).
3. From (1,0) to (1,1). Next is either back to (1,0) or forward to (1,2).
4. From (1,1) to (1,2). Next attached nodes are (0,2) and (1,3).
5. From (1,2) to (0,2). Then move from (0,2) to (0,3) or connect back to (1,2).
6. From (0,2) to (0,3). Further connections to (1,3).
7. From (0,3) to (1,3). From here, move to (2,3).
8. From (1,3) to (2,3). Possible connections to (2,2) or (1,3).
9. From (2,3) to (2,2). From here we can move to (2,1) or (3,2).
10. Proceed from (2,2) to (3,2).
11. From (3,2) to (3,3), which is our target.

Path from origin to target: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures:
- Every move is connected and adjacent as per the adjacency list without any breakdown or skipped connections.
- No path crosses an unmentioned pair, and no invalid movement occurs between any point not directly connected as per the adjacency list presented in the query.
