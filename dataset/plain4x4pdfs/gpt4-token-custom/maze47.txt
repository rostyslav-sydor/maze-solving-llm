<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning:
1. **Starting Point:** (0,0) as indicated by <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>.
2. **Goal:** (3,3) as indicated by <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>.

### Steps to Solution:
- **From (0,0) to (1,0):** In adjacency list, (0,0) <--> (1,0) is connected.
- **From (1,0) to (2,0):** In adjacency list, (2,0) <--> (1,0).
- **From (2,0) to (3,0):** In adjacency list, (3,0) <--> (2,0).
- **From (3,0) to (3,1):** In adjacency list, (3,1) <--> (3,0).
- **From (3,1) to (2,1):** In adjacency list, (2,1) <--> (3,1).
- **From (2,1) to (2,2):** In adjacency list, (2,1) <--> (2,2).
- **From (2,2) to (3,2):** In adjacency list, (2,2) <--> (3,2).
- **From (3,2) to (3,3):** In adjacency list, (3,2) <--> (3,3).

### Validating the Path:
Each move from one cell to the connected cell can be traced sequentially in the adjacency list, confirming valid steps without any wall crossing. Also, the path uses only adjacent cells that are connected directly in the adjacency list, confirming the path is valid and does not cross walls.
