To solve the maze depicted in the provided adjacency list, each step will be manually traced to find a valid path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

1. **Understanding the Format:** Each pairing `(x1,y1) <--> (x2,y2)` in the adjacency list gives a bidirectional connection between two points. 

2. **Determining Neighbors:** By examining the adjacency list, identify nodes directly connected to the start point (0,0):
   - (0,0) <--> (0,1)
   - (0,0) <--> (1,0)

3. **Tracing the Path:** Start from the origin, then follow paths through the graph that use only connected nodes, while working towards the target:
   - Starting at `(0,0)`, possible paths can go to `(0,1)` or `(1,0)`. Choose `(0,1)`.
   - From `(0,1)`, connected nodes are `(0,0)` (back) and `(0,2)`, and there's a diagonal to `(1,1)`. Continue to `(0,2)`.
   - From `(0,2)`, go to `(0,3)`.
   - From `(0,3)`, go to `(1,3)`.
   - From `(1,3)`, options are `(0,3)` (back) or next nodes `(1,2)`. Continue to `(1,2)`.
   - From `(1,2)`, the connections continue to `(2,2)`, and also loop back to several places such as `(1,1)` and `(1,3)`.
   - From `(2,2)`, move to `(3,2)`.
   - And finally from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)` which is the target. 

4. **Path Validation:** The traced path must not cut across any pairings not allowed by the adjacency list. Hence, check that each successive step exists as a connection in the adjacency list without crossing over any non-defined pairings:

   - `(0,0)` to `(0,1)`
   - `(0,1)` to `(0,2)`
   - `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`
   - `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`
   - `(1,3)` to `(1,2)`
   - `(1,2)` to `(2,2)`
   - `(2,2)` to `(3,2)`
   - `(3,2)` to `(3,3)`

5. **Output the Correct Format:** Format the solution in the required coordinate list format.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path confirms the solution as it uses only adjacent cells, adheres to the original adjacency list, and successfully moves from the origin to the target.
