<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Explanation and Reasoning:

1. **Start Point**: The entry to the maze is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (3,3). Based on the adjacency list provided, I start my traversal from the entry point by examining available adjacent nodes.

2. **Exploring Paths**: Given the adjacency list:
   - Starting from **(0,0)**:
     - It connects to **(1,0)** and **(0,1)**.
     - Choosing **(1,0)**, as it continues towards our target’s column.
   - From **(1,0)**:
     - Connected nodes include **(0,0)** and **(2,0)**.
     - Choose **(2,0)**, aiming to go downward vertically, aligning with the exit’s row.
   - From **(2,0)**:
     - It connects to **(1,0)** and **(3,0)**.
     - Pick **(3,0)**, as it brings us to the last row.
   - At **(3,0)**:
     - We can move right to **(3,1)** towards the target.
   - From **(3,1)**:
     - Moving rightward to **(3,2)** staying aligned horizontally with the exit.
   - Progressing from **(3,2)**:
     - The next straightforward choice is **(3,3)**, the exit.

3. **Validating the Path**: Each of the transitions described above:
   - (0,0) <-> (1,0)
   - (1,0) <-> (2,0)
   - (2,0) <-> (3,0)
   - (3,0) <-> (3,1)
   - (3,1) <-> (3,2)
   - (3,2) <-> (3,3)
   
   These are supported directly by the connectivity described in the adjacency list, ensuring the path follows actual passages without intersecting any "walls".

4. **Adjacent Cells Use**: Every chosen step moves to a directly connected cell, either horizontally or vertically, perfect for maze navigation.

5. **End Points**: The stipulated entry (0,0) and exit (3,3) match the origin and target descriptions provided.

Through this careful selection and justification using the provided adjacency list, the proposed path meets all requirements of the maze, including connectivity and direct adjacency rules.
