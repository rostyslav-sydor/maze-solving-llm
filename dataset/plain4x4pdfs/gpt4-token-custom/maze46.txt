To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we need to determine a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3).

### Approach for Solving the Maze:
1. Parse the adjacency list to understand the connections between the cells.
2. Use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

### BFS Algorithm Steps:
- Start from the origin and explore all adjacent nodes at the current depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- Queue each connected node that has not yet been visited and mark it as visited.
- Continue this process until the target is reached or all possible paths are explored.

### Analyzing the Adjacency List:
The adjacency list defines the following direct connections between cells:
```
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
```

### Implementing BFS:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Explore neighbors: (1,0).
3. From (1,0), explore (2,0) and queue.
4. From (2,0), explore (3,0) and queue.
5. From (3,0), explore (3,1) and queue.
6. From (3,1), explore and queue (2,1).
7. From (2,1), explore (1,1) and queue.
8. From (1,1), explore and queue (1,2).
9. From (1,2), explore and queue (2,2).
10. From (2,2), explore and queue (3,2).
11. From (3,2), explore and reach (3,3).

### Verifying the Path:
Validating the path from (0,0) to (3,3) via the nodes explored ensures that no walls are crossed and only adjacent cells defined in the adjacency list are used.

### Conclusion:
The determined path through BFS:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path adheres to the adjacency list rules and passes through adjacent cells only. Thus, it effectively solves the maze.
