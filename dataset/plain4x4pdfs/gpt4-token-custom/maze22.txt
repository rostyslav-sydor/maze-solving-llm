To solve the maze presented in the format of an adjacency list, we will employ a classic pathfinding approach using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is commonly used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which makes it appropriate for a maze where each step from one node to its adjacent node is equal in cost or distance.

We begin by parsing the adjacency list to visualize or understand the maze structure as a graph:

- **Vertices** represent positions in the maze, denoted by (row, column) coordinates.
- **Edges** express allowed paths (connections) between these positions.

#### Parsed Adjacency List:
- (0,0) connected to (1,0), (0,1)
- (0,1) connected to (0,0), (1,1), (0,2)
- (0,2) connected to (0,1), (1,2)
- (0,3) connected to (1,3)
- (1,0) connected to (0,0), (2,0), (1,1)
- (1,1) connected to (0,1), (2,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) connected to (0,2), (1,3), (1,1)
- (1,3) connected to (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)
- (2,0) connected to (3,0), (1,0)
- (2,1) connected to (1,1), (3,1), (2,2)
- (2,2) connected to (3,2), (2,1)
- (2,3) connected to (1,3), (3,3)
- (3,0) connected to (3,1), (2,0)
- (3,1) connected to (2,1), (3,2), (3,0)
- (3,2) connected to (3,3), (2,2), (3,1)
- (3,3) connected to (2,3), (3,2)

#### Start and End Points As Per the Question:
- **Start**: (0,0)
- **End**: (3,3)

With BFS, we traverse the graph starting from (0,0) to explore all possible paths systematically until the end point (3,3) is reached or until all possibilities are explored.

#### Solution Process:
1. Start a BFS from the vertex (0,0).
2. Use a queue to handle the current nodes under exploration and track visited nodes to prevent revisiting.
3. Add each neighboring node to the queue in the order they are explored.

#### BFS Traversal Results in the Path:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0), next (2,0), followed by (3,0).
3. From (3,0), move to (3,1).
4. From (3,1), move to (3,2) and finally to (3,3).

#### Validated Path:
- Every consecutive pair of coordinates in the sequence (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) are indeed connected according to the adjacency list.
- The path has no cycles, returns to a previously visited node, or crosses any unstated paths (walls).

Hence, a plausible solution in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
