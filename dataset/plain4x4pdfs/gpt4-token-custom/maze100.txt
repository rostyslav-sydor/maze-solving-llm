<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind Path Selection:**

1. **Start at Origin:** The provided entry point to the maze is (0,0).
2. **Move to (0,1):** Direct connection is present.
3. **Move to (0,2):** There is a direct adjacency from (0,1) to (0,2).
4. **Move to (1,2):** Connection between (0,2) and (1,2) exists.
5. **Move to (2,2):** There is a link from (1,2) to (2,2).
6. **Move to (3,2):** Sequence continues appropriately from (2,2) to (3,2).
7. **Move to (3,3):** Final link connecting to the target (3,3).

**Validation:**

- **Continuity & Connectivity:** The path follows a sequence of directly connected cells as per the adjacency list without any breaks.
- **Walls and Restrictions:** No paths utilized in this route involve traversing through walls/non-adjacent points as all steps conform to the adjacency list.
- **Finish at Target:** The path concludes precisely at the designated exit point (3,3) for the maze. 

The path satisfies all conditions of the maze, utilizing valid connections without breaching any barriers or disconnected points.
