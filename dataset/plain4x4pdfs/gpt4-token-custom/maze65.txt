To solve the given maze, we can employ a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze or graph. First, let's decode the adjacency list and then compute the BFS to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Extracting adjacency list:**
- (0,0) connects to (0,1), (1,0)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0), (0,2)
- (0,2) connects to (0,1), (0,3), (1,2)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)
- (1,0) connects to (1,1), (2,0), (0,0)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)
- (1,2) connects to (1,1), (0,2), (1,3)
- (1,3) connects to (1,2), (2,3)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0), (3,0)
- (2,1) connects to (2,2), (1,1), (3,1)
- (2,2) connects to (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)
- (2,3) connects to (2,2), (3,3), (1,3)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0), (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0), (2,1)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3), (2,2)
- (3,3) connects to (3,2), (2,3)

**Solve with BFS:**
1. The BFS algorithm will explore the shortest paths from the origin systematically.
2. Starting from the origin (0,0), check the nodes connected (0,1) and (1,0).
3. Continue the process, expanding outwards, always checking for unvisited nodes that connect from the last node visited.
4. When you reach the target (3,3), backtrack to construct the actual path.

**BFS path computation:**
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) (adjacent to (0,0))
- Then proceed to (0,2) (adjacent to (0,1))
- Next go to (1,2) (adjacent to (0,2))
- Follow by (1,3) (adjacent to (1,2))
- Then to (2,3) (adjacent to (1,3))
- Finally, reach (3,3) (adjacent to (2,3))

**Verification:**
- The extracted path should have all nodes linked directly in the adjacency list provided, and no wall is crossed.
- Each move from one node to the next is a direct neighbor either vertically or horizontally, which complies with the described adjacency.

**Output the path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route satisfies the adjacency relations and correctly represents a valid path from entry to exit as per the maze's specifications.
