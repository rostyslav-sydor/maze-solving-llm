To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we utilize a graph traversal algorithm. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and results of these calculations:

1. **Graph Representation Extraction**:
   From the adjacency list, we extract nodes (corresponding to positions in the maze) and their connections (corresponding to pathways between positions):
   ```
   (1,2) <-> (2,2)
   (2,1) <-> (3,1)
   (2,2) <-> (2,3)
   (0,3) <-> (0,2)
   (1,0) <-> (1,1)
   (0,1) <-> (0,0)
   (3,3) <-> (2,3)
   (2,1) <-> (2,0)
   (3,1) <-> (3,2)
   (1,3) <-> (2,3)
   (1,2) <-> (0,2)
   (3,0) <-> (2,0)
   (1,1) <-> (1,2)
   (0,0) <-> (1,0)
   (0,3) <-> (1,3)
   (1,0) <-> (2,0)
   (3,2) <-> (2,2)
   (0,1) <-> (0,2)
   (3,2) <-> (3,3)
   ```

2. **Entry and Exit Points**:
   - Entry (origin): (0,0)
   - Exit (target): (3,3)

3. **Path-Finding Algorithm**:
   A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an appropriate choice here since it can efficiently find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which represents our maze with all connections having the same "cost" or "distance" of moving from one cell to another.

   - Start BFS from the entry point (0,0).
   - Explore all directly connected nodes.
   - Mark each visited node to avoid revisiting and keep track of the path to reach the node.
   - Continue until the exit point (3,3) is reached or all possibilities are checked.

4. **Constructing and Extracting the Path**:
   Using the BFS search, the path from the entry to exit is constructed as follows:
   ```
   From (0,0) to (0,1)
   From (0,1) to (0,2)
   From (0,2) to (0,3)
   From (0,3) to (1,3)
   From (1,3) to (2,3)
   From (2,3) to (3,3)
   ```
   Each move is directly to an adjacent cell with no walls in between as per the adjacency list details.

5. **Output Path**:
   Encapsulating the successful path between the designated tokens:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

6. **Verification**:
   By examining the adjacency list and the path taken:
   - Each move corresponds to an existing connection in the adjacency list.
   - No walls are crossed, and each path step uses only directly connected cells per the maze structure.

This correctly navigated maze path, as calculated, solves the problem as requested using a robust path-finding algorithm ensuring accurate and connected stepwise traversal of the maze.
