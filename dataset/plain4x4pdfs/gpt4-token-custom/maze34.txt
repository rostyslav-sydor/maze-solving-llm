To solve the maze from the adjacency list, I'll reconstruct the connections into a graph structure and then use a pathfinding algorithm to find a route from the origin to the target. The adjacency list represents the nodes (coordinates) and the edges between them. Let's summarize the given adjacency list details and the origin and target points for clarity.

**Graph Adjacency List:**
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (2,2) <-> (2,3)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (0,0) <-> (0,1)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,1) <-> (2,1)
- (2,2) <-> (1,2)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,2) <-> (1,1)
- (2,0) <-> (2,1)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2)

**Origin:** (0,0)

**Target:** (3,3)

Given this, I use a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find a valid path from the origin to the target. Starting from the origin (0,0), we follow through the connections only if they exist in the adjacency list, verifying each step maintains a valid connection until reaching the target (3,3).

Hereâ€™s the correct path, determined step by step following the listed valid connections:

Starting at (0,0), connected with:
1. (0,0) <-> (0,1) to (0,1)
2. (0,1) <-> (0,2) to (0,2)
3. (0,2) <-> (1,2) to (1,2)
4. (1,2) <-> (1,3) to (1,3)
5. (1,3) <-> (2,3) to (2,3)
6. (2,3) <-> (3,3) to (3,3)

**Path Output:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I ensured that my path uses only the available edges (from adjacency list), and the path from one coordinate to the next is adjacent either row-wise or column-wise, confirming that it doesn't cross any walls or use non-adjacent cells. The solution is optimal, adhering to the conditions of the maze provided in the adjacency list format.
