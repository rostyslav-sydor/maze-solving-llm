To solve the maze, we start by parsing the adjacency list to determine the connections between each coordinate. Evaluating all the possible paths from the origin (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) is required, preferably using a path-finding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to its layer-by-layer exploration which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

We initialize BFS with the starting node (0,0), marking it visited, and explore all its neighbors by repeatedly dequeuing a node, marking it visited, and enqueueing all its non-visited, directly connected neighbors until we reach the target node (3,3). Each enqueue operation also needs to record the path taken to reach each node.

The adjacency list parsed from the given representation indicates which cells can be directly traveled between, ensuring that every step of the path respects the maze's layout without crossing walls and only uses adjacent cells. Let's implement this logic to derive the path.

1. First, we start at (0,0). According to the graph, (0,0) connects directly to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), there are connections to (1,1) and (0,2).
3. Proceeding to (1,1), paths can then follow through to (1,0) and (2,1); the presence of connections to multiple potential paths suggests checking all.
4. We can move next to (2,1), which directly connects to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), we can travel to (1,2), (3,2), and (2,3).
6. Next, going to (3,2), which leads directly to (3,3), our destination.

Assembling the path:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Each coordinate step ensures no walls are crossed and all movements are to adjacent cells as outlined in the adjacency list. No jumps skip allowed connections, following only the graph's defined routes. 

In summary, this path fulfills the maze's adjacency requirements and ends at the desired target point. Let's format it:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path solution provisionally follows the adjacency list structure and utilizes each available connection without violation, offering a clear way through the maze from the origin to the target.
