To solve this maze, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which systematically explores the graph and ensures the shortest path is found if one exists:

1. **Build the Graph**
   - Start by defining the adjacency list clearly. This list shows point-to-point connections which we extract from the maze description:
     ```
     (2,0) <--> (1,0)
     (1,2) <--> (1,3)
     (0,0) <--> (1,0)
     (3,3) <--> (2,3)
     (1,1) <--> (2,1)
     (0,0) <--> (0,1)
     (2,2) <--> (2,3)
     (0,2) <--> (0,3)
     (0,1) <--> (0,2)
     (0,3) <--> (1,3)
     (3,2) <--> (2,2)
     (3,0) <--> (3,1)
     (1,1) <--> (0,1)
     (2,0) <--> (2,1)
     (2,1) <--> (2,2)
     (0,2) <--> (1,2)
     (3,2) <--> (3,1)
     (2,3) <--> (1,3)
     (2,2) <--> (1,2)
     (2,1) <--> (3,1)
     (1,1) <--> (1,2)
     ```
   - Note the given start (origin) is at (0,0) and the destination (target) is at (3,3).

2. **Apply BFS** 
   - Start from (0,0), explore all connected nodes, and continue exploring nodes that are connected to these until (3,3) is reached or all possible paths are explored. We mark nodes as "visited" to avoid rechecking.
   - Maintain a queue of nodes to explore next and a map of predecessors to backtrack the final path.
   - Since BFS explores layer-by-layer, it guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
  
3. **Backtrack the Solution**
   - Once (3,3) is found, backtrack using the predecessor map or a similar structure to reconstruct the path from (0,0) to (3,3).
   - Ensure during this reconstruction that each step moves from one cell to an adjacent cell as specified in the adjacency list, ensuring no wall crossing or illegal movement occurs.

4. **Result and Verification**
   - Construct and output the path. Further, ensure that each move in your final path directly maps to an entry in the adjacency list, thus confirming all moves are legal and no walls have been crossed inadvertently.

Given the steps, a potential answer, upon performing BFS and ensuring accurate recording and backtracking of paths, will be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path originates at (0,0), progresses through the graph following valid connections, and terminates at the target location (3,3), traversing no walls and using only adjacent cells. Each move reflects adjacency in the list, and thus a valid traversal through the maze.
