To find the solution to the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, the entries can be visualized as connections between the cells of an implicit grid. The adjacency list describes which cells are directly connected or adjacent and hence navigable. The task is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Step-by-step solution of the maze**:
1. Start at the origin (0,0), which is connected to (0,1) and (1,0) as per the adjacency list.

2. From (0,0), move to (1,0) (as moving to (0,1) does not seem to lead directly towards our target based on alternate choices).

3. From (1,0), you can go either back to (0,0) or forward to (1,1) or (2,0). Move to (1,1), as it progresses in a direction closer to our target.

4. From (1,1), move to (1,2) because it provides a pathway that navigates towards the direction of the target.

5. From (1,2), we can move to (1,3) or (2,2) or (0,2). Heading to (2,2) as both (1,3) and (0,2) move away from our target (3,3).

6. From (2,2), move to (2,3) as it's again moving closer to (3,3).

7. From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is our target.

As we mark the path:
- Confirm that each transition between nodes in the path uses only allowed paths from the adjacency list: (1,0) to (1,1), (1,1) to (1,2), (1,2) to (2,2), (2,2) to (2,3), and (2,3) to (3,3) are all connections listed.
- Make sure no steps along the path attempt to "jump" through nonadjacent or unconnected cells based on the adjacency list descriptions.

**Output format**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path does not cross any walls, adhering to the adjacency list and utilizes direct navigable connections between each cell listed, ensuring it provides a legitimate path from the origin to the target in the maze.
