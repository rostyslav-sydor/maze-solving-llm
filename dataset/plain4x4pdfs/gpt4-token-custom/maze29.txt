To find a solution to the maze above, letâ€™s break down each part:

1. We start by extracting the adjacency list from the given description, which shows how different cells (coordinates) are connected.

2. We identify the origin (entry point) and the target (exit point) defined in the maze. 

3. Lastly, use a path-finding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a shortest path from the entry to the exit.

**Adjacency List**

- (1,3) <---> (1,2)
- (2,1) <---> (2,2)
- (0,1) <---> (1,1)
- (2,3) <---> (3,3)
- (3,2) <---> (3,3)
- (3,1) <---> (3,2)
- (0,1) <---> (0,0)
- (2,1) <---> (1,1)
- (1,1) <---> (1,2)
- (3,1) <---> (3,0)
- (2,2) <---> (2,3)
- (2,0) <---> (3,0)
- (0,3) <---> (0,2)
- (2,1) <---> (2,0)
- (0,0) <---> (1,0)
- (1,3) <---> (2,3)
- (1,0) <---> (2,0)
- (1,3) <---> (0,3)
- (3,2) <---> (2,2)
- (0,2) <---> (0,1)
- (1,2) <---> (2,2)

**Entry and Exit Points**
- Entry: (0,0)
- Exit: (3,3)

**Pathfinding**
Using BFS, start from (0,0) and find connecting cells until we reach (3,3). Each step must ensure the linked coordinate is accessible, based on the adjacency list.

**BFS Search for Path**
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0) (connected to start)
- Move to (2,0) (connected to (1,0))
- Move to (3,0) (connected to (2,0))
- Move to (3,1) (connected to (3,0))
- Move to (3,2) (connected to (3,1))
- Reach (3,3) (connected to (3,2))

Now, let's format this path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We check and verify none of these movements cross a wall, as per given adjacencies, and each step is between connected cells only, successfully satisfying the maze's rules. This ensures our path above is valid.
