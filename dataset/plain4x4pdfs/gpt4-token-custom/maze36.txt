Let's first understand the structure of the given maze which is represented as an adjacency list of nodes (or cells), where each pair of nodes represents two adjacent cells in the maze. 

I'll parse the cells and their connections from the adjacency list:

- (1,1) ↔ (1,2)
- (2,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,1) ↔ (2,1)
- (1,3) ↔ (1,2)
- (0,3) ↔ (0,2)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,2)
- (3,2) ↔ (2,2)
- (1,3) ↔ (2,3)
- (3,0) ↔ (2,0)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,0)
- (2,3) ↔ (3,3)
- (1,3) ↔ (0,3)
- (0,0) ↔ (0,1)
- (0,2) ↔ (0,1)
- (1,0) ↔ (0,0)
- (1,1) ↔ (1,0)
- (2,0) ↔ (1,0)

Next, identify the entry and exit:

- Entry: (0,0)
- Exit: (3,3)

We want to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using these available connections without crossing any walls and only move between directly connected adjacent cells.

Let's find a feasible path from the parsed adjacency list:

1. Begin at the Origin: (0,0)
2. Move directly from (0,0) to (0,1) as they are connected.
3. Continue from (0,1) to (0,2).
4. From (0,2) to (0,3).
5. Go from (0,3) to (1,3).
6. Proceed from (1,3) to (1,2).
7. Move from (1,2) to (1,1).
8. Compare available paths: from (1,1) you can move to (1,0) and then to (1,1) again, or directly to (1,0). Since we aim for the exit, evaluate other directions, move realigning to re-enter the main path:
   - Go back: (1,1) to (1,2), then (1,2) to (2,2).
9. From (2,2) to (3,2).
10. Move from (3,2) via (3,1) to (3,0) and then to (2,0) to connect lightly with previous node.
11. Then, backtrack to main path:
   - (3,2) to (2,2), and finally progress to (2,3).
12. Move from (2,3) to (3,3) for the Exit.

Thus, a possible successful path without breaking any rules indexing into the connections only would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each step moves directly to an adjacent cell, as permitted by the maze's adjacency list, preventing invalid movements or "wall-crossing".
