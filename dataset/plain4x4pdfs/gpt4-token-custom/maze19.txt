**Explanation of Steps:**

1. Start at the origin, (0,0).
2. Follow to (1,0) since it's directly adjacent to the start.
3. Move to (1,1), which is connected to (1,0).
4. Proceed to (1,2), connected to (1,1).
5. Head over to (1,3), the only way from (1,2) that goes vertically within the bounds.
6. From (1,3) loop to (0,3) to move towards the top row.
7. Reach (0,2) from (0,3), maintaining traversal on the top row.
8. Continue to (0,1), transitioning left.
9. Loop back through the initial point (0,0) to reposition.
10. Return to (1,0) as it connects back from (0,0).
11. Cross horizontally to (2,0).
12. Move down to (3,0).
13. Then to (3,1) which is part of the bottom row moving right.
14. Proceed to (3,2), following the right movement.
15. Finally reach (3,3), the exit of the maze.

This path uses valid connections provided by the given adjacency list, which define permissible movements without jumping over undefined walls or making diagonal jumps that arenâ€™t allowed. Each move adheres to the adjacency constraints, ensuring the solution is valid and correct.
