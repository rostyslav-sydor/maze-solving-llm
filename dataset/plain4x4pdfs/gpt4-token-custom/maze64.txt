To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list describes which cells are directly connected and thus can be traveled between.

Here's the outlined strategy:

### 1. Understand the Adjacency List
From the adjacency list given, convert it to a more workable format, mapping each point to its directly connected neighbors:
- (2,2) connects to (2,3), (2,1)
- (3,1) connects to (2,1), (3,0)
- (0,0) connects to (1,0), (0,1)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3), (2,3)
- (1,0) connects to (1,1)
- (1,1) connects to (2,1), (1,2)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0), (2,2)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3), (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (2,2)
- (1,2) connects to (1,3), (1,1), (0,2)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)
- (0,2) connects to (0,3), (1,2)

### 2. Implement Pathfinding
Using this mapping, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) would be appropriate to find the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3).

### 3. Execute the BFS
- Start from (0,0)
- Explore neighbors (1,0), (0,1)
- From (1,0), move to (1,1)
- From (1,1), explore neighbors (2,1), (1,2)
- Continue this pattern following the adjacency rules until (3,3) is reached.

### 4. Construct the Path
- As the BFS proceeds, keep track of the path taken to reach each node.
- Upon reaching (3,3), backtrack using this tracking to determine the path taken.

### 5. Output the Path
After tracing the path, the coordinates from starting point (0,0) to ending point (3,3) via BFS are collected sequentially. This forms the solution to the maze.

### Path Validation
- Check that each step in the path only moves between directly connected nodes as per the adjacency list and doesn't skip any intermediate unconnected cells.
- Make sure no walls (non-connected adjacent cells) are crossed.

### Construct the Final Output
Provided the correct and validated path from BFS:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that only legal moves as denoted in the list are taken and no walls are bypassed. Each step progresses to a directly connected neighbor culminating at the target.
