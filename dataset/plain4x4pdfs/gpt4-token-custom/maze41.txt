<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Starting point from the adjacency list and defined entry point is (0,0).
2. Following valid moves are searched:
   - From (0,0) go to (0,1), using the connection (0,0) <--> (0,1).
   - Then, move from (0,1) to (1,1), using (0,1) <--> (1,1).
   - Proceed from (1,1) to (2,1), using (1,1) <--> (2,1).
   - From (2,1) move to (2,2), using the connection (2,1) <--> (2,2).
   - From (2,2), a move to (3,2) is taken, using (2,2) <--> (3,2).
   - Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3) using (3,2) <--> (3,3), which is the defined exit point.
3. The entire path consists of directly connecting nodes without jumping or backtracking:
   - Each movement connects directly neighboring coordinates as defined in adjacency pairs.
   - There are no walls crossed as every step uses an explicit link, and hence the path is valid and adheres to adjacency relationships in the maze's design.
4. No cycles or unused adjacent nodes are part of the path, keeping it efficient and constrained to necessary movements to reach the exit (3,3) from the start (0,0).
