First, the adjacency list is interpreted to form a grid-based maze where each node (representing a cell in the maze) has edges connecting to adjacent nodes (representing possible movements to adjacent cells). Letâ€™s translate this adjacency list into a more visual format to ascertain which nodes are connected:

- (1,3) <--> (0,3); (2,1) <--> (3,1); (3,2) <--> (2,2); (0,2) <--> (0,3); (2,2) <--> (2,3); 
- (1,1) <--> (2,1); (3,2) <--> (3,1); (1,0) <--> (0,0); (2,3) <--> (3,3); (0,2) <--> (1,2); 
- (3,3) <--> (3,2); (3,0) <--> (2,0); (0,1) <--> (0,2); (3,1) <--> (3,0); (0,1) <--> (0,0); 
- (1,2) <--> (1,1); (2,3) <--> (1,3); (0,1) <--> (1,1).

Next, using the entry (0,0) and exit (3,3) points specified, we need to identify a pathway using this synchronized grid data. We start from (0,0) and find a series of connected nodes leading to (3,3).

1. Start at (0,0) -> Connected to (1,0) and (0,1)

2. From (0,0), move to (0,1) -> Connected to (0,2)

3. From (0,1), move to (0,2) -> Connected to (0,3) and (1,2)

4. From (0,2), move to (1,2) -> Connected to (1,1) and (2,2)

5. From (1,2), move to (2,2) -> Connected to (2,3) and (3,2)

6. From (2,2), move to (3,2) -> Connected to (3,1) and (3,3)

7. From (3,2), move up to (3,3).

Plotting this path, moving sequentially from one referenced cell to the next, we ensure that each movement is to an adjacent cell as permitted by the adjacency list. Thus, the path found is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution ensures no crossing of walls, and each pair of sequential coordinates is legitimately connected per the given maze structure, allowing valid passage from maze entry to exit.
