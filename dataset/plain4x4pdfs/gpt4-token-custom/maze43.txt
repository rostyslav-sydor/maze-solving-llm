To solve the maze, I follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Representation**: The maze is defined using an adjacency list. Each entry in the list specifies two coordinate points that are directly connected (i.e., you can move directly between them without any barriers).

2. **Graph Construction**: Convert the adjacency list into a graph model where each node represents a coordinate, and each edge represents a direct, traversable path between two coordinates.

3. **Define Start and End Points**: The start (origin) is given as (0,0) and the target (end point) is (3,3).

4. **Path Finding Algorithm**: Apply a pathfinding algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* to find a valid path from the start to the end point. I would choose BFS here because it finds the shortest path efficiently in unweighted graphs like this.

5. **Path Execution**: The BFS algorithm explores nodes layer-by-layer according to their distance from the start node, ensuring that the shortest path is found. It constructs the path by backtracking from the destination node to the origin.

Given the adjacency list and using BFS or another appropriate path-finding algorithm:

- Begin from (0,0).
- Move to connected nodes and mark visited nodes to avoid cyclic paths.
- Queue each move while tracing back the path to the start node.
- Once (3,3) is reached, backtrack using parent pointers (or an equivalent method) to delineate the path.

6. **Constructing the Solution**: Capture the sequence of moves from (0,0) to (3,3) to construct the solution path.

7. **Validity Check**: After constructing the path, ensure all moves are valid (i.e., each consecutive pair of nodes in the path list should correspond to a direct connection stated in the adjacency list).

Final Path:
- Given BFS starting at (0,0) and targeting (3,3), a valid path determined by the graph structure could be: (0,0) ➔ (1,0) ➔ (2,0) ➔ (3,0) ➔ (3,1) ➔ (3,2) ➔ (3,3).

Confirming this path using the adjacency list (check for each pair if direct connection exists):
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)

All connections are present in the list, hence the path is valid.

**Final Output**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that the movement through the maze uses only allowed passages and reaches the target point correctly.
