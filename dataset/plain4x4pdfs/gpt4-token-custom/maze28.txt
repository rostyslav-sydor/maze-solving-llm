To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, we first identify the start and end points of the maze:
- Entry point (origin): (0,0)
- Exit point (target): (3,3)

From the adjacency list, we build a representation of which cells are connected to which, creating a graph:
```plaintext
(0,3) <--> (0,2)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,1) <--> (3,1)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(2,2) <--> (2,1)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
```

The goal is to find a path from the origin to the target using BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), or any other graph traversal method. Here, we assume BFS is used which finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

We initialize our search at the origin (0,0) and explore all connected nodes layer by layer:
1. From (0,0), the next accessible node is (0,1).
2. From (0,1), we can go to (0,2) or (1,1).
3. We continue expanding outwards:
   - From (0,2) to (0,3) and (1,2).
   - From (1,2) to (2,2) and keep connecting further cells as per adjacency until reaching (3,3).

Between each step, verify that connections exist as per the adjacency list. The path found through BFS ensures the shortest path without revisiting nodes or navigating through walls, as BFS explores all possible nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.

Given we have validated each connection exists in the list and BFS uses only valid adjacencies, the resulting path will not cross any walls and only traverse between directly connected, adjacent cells.

The result of the BFS path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the described method will look like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

Each step moves to an adjacent cell in accordance with the defined edges in the adjacency list, ensuring no walls are crossed.
