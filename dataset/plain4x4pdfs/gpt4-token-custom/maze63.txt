To solve the maze, I will first decode the adjacency list to understand the connectivity of the maze's nodes (cell coordinates). The maze's entry point is at (0,0) and the exit is at (3,3).

Here's the adjacency list parsing:
```plaintext
(1,1) <--> (1,0) 
(1,3) <--> (1,2) 
(3,0) <--> (2,0) 
(2,1) <--> (1,1) 
(3,2) <--> (3,3) 
(0,1) <--> (0,0) 
(2,0) <--> (1,0) 
(1,2) <--> (2,2) 
(2,2) <--> (2,3) 
(3,1) <--> (2,1) 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) 
(1,3) <--> (0,3) 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) 
(1,2) <--> (0,2) 
(2,2) <--> (3,2) 
(2,3) <--> (1,3) 
(0,1) <--> (1,1) 
(3,3) <--> (2,3) 
(0,0) <--> (1,0) 
(2,1) <--> (2,2) 
```

Using the above connectivity, I deduced a solution path from the maze.
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) which is directly connected to (0,0).
3. Then move to (1,1), from (1,0) there's a direct connection.
4. Next, move to (1,2) which directly connects to (1,1).
5. Move from (1,2) to (2,2) directly.
6. From (2,2) move to (3,2) as there's a direct connection.
7. Finally, from (3,2) move to (3,3), the exit point.

This path uses all and only adjacently connected cells as given in the adjacency list, ensuring it does not cross any walls and utilizes valid cell connections:
- (0,0) to (1,0)
- (1,0) to (1,1)
- (1,1) to (1,2)
- (1,2) to (2,2)
- (2,2) to (3,2)
- (3,2) to (3,3)

Let's encode this path as requested with the appropriate tokens:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
