First, I will translate the adjacency list into a graph representation that allows pathfinding.

The adjacency list provided gives the connectivity between nodes in the maze, where each node is represented as a coordinate pair. To find a path, I'll reconstruct the list to a more visual manner to understand connections better:

- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

Now, using these details, finding a path from the origin, (0,0), to the target, (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0). Connected to (0,1) and (1,0).
2. From (0,0), move to (0,1). Connected to (0,2).
3. Then to (0,2), connected to (0,3) and (1,2).
4. From (0,2), move to (1,2). Connected to (1,3).
5. From (1,2), move to (1,3). Connected to (0,3).
6. Then move from (1,3) to (0,3). Gives a more direct path forward.
7. From (0,3), find path to (1,3).
8. From (1,3), traverse directly to (2,3). Connected to (3,3).
9. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3).

Cross-checking this path:
- No illegal moves (across walls) detected.
- All moves occur between directly connected cells.

Therefore, the valid path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path strictly follows the available paths described in the adjacency list and does not cross any walls or move diagonally between unconnected cells.
