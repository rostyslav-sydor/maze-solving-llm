To solve the maze, I first converted the given adjacency list to a graph representation, where each point (represented as a tuple) contains connections to its directly adjacent points (neighbors). The entry point is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (3,3).

Starting at (0,0), we use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore the shortest path to the target (3,3). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step exploration following the BFS:

1. Start at (0,0).
   - Neighbors: (1,0), (0,1)

2. From (0,1):
   - Neighbors: (0,0), (0,2)

3. From (1,0):
   - Neighbors: (0,0), (1,1)

4. From (0,2):
   - Neighbors: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2)

5. From (1,1):
   - Neighbors: (1,0), (2,1)

6. From (1,2):
   - Neighbors: (0,2), (1,3)

7. From (0,3):
   - Neighbors: (0,2), (1,3)

8. From (2,1):
   - Neighbors: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)

9. From (1,3):
   - Neighbors: (1,2), (0,3), (2,3)

10. From (2,0):
    - Neighbors: (2,1), (3,0)

11. From (2,2):
    - Neighbors: (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)

12. From (2,3):
    - Neighbors: (2,2), (3,3), (1,3)

13. From (3,0):
   - Neighbors: (3,1), (2,0)

14. From (3,1):
   - Neighbors: (3,0), (3,2)

15. From (3,2):
   - Neighbors: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2)

16. Reach (3,3) from (3,2).

Following this search, the shortest path found that leads to the exit is:
- (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Validating the solution, we can confirm that each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell that is directly reachable without crossing any walls, ensuring the integrity of the path.

Finally, the solution to the maze problem, in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
