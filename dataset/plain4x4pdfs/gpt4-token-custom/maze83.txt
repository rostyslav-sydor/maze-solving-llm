To solve the maze and find the shortest path from start (0,0) to target (3,3) with the given adjacency list, I will analyze step-by-step from the defined coordinates and edges to make sure the path connects only adjacent cells without crossing any walls.

### Parsing Adjacency List
From the adjacency list provided, we can construct a graph where each coordinate pair (x, y) refers to a node, and an edge ("<-->") between two nodes indicates they are directly connected. Let's map these connections to visualize the maze network.

### Step-by-Step Traversal
1. Starting at (0,0), this node is connected to (0,1).
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1). Next, (0,1) is linked to (0,2).
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2). Then, (0,2) is connected to (1,2).
4. Transition from (0,2) to (1,2). From here, (1,2) is connected to (1,3).
5. Shift from (1,2) to (1,3). Now, (1,3) has a route to (2,3).
6. Proceed from (1,3) to (2,3). Node (2,3) is directly linked to (3,3), our target.

### Sequence of Movements
So our path from the origin to the target is as follows:
- Start at (0,0)
- Proceed to (0,1)
- Then to (0,2)
- Travel to (1,2)
- Move to (1,3)
- Go to (2,3)
- Finally, reach (3,3)

### Verification
Now, verifying whether the suggested path is using only adjacently connected points and not crossing any walls:
- Each transition along the path matches a connection in the adjacency list.
- There aren't any skipped coordinates or diagonal moves that don't match the provided adjacency pairings.
  
### Final Path
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution strictly adheres to the adjacencies provided, ensuring no walls are crossed and all movements use only adjacent cells. The steps outlined use the shortest direct route based on the provided connections.
