<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Parsing**: First, the adjacency list is converted into a usable format where each pair of coordinates shows direct connections (adjacency).

2. **Graph Construction**: Construct a graph from the adjacency list where each node represents a coordinate, and an edge between any two nodes means direct passage is allowed.

3. **Path Finding**: Use a path-finding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for the shortest path or Depth-First Search (DFS) for any path from the origin to the target.

    - Start from the **origin** (0,0).
    - Move to connected nodes and check if they lead to the **target** (3,3).
    - Through BFS: At each step, the search expands to all adjacent nodes not visited before.
  
4. **Constructing the Path**:
    - Starting at (0,0), looking at adjacency:
        - (1,0) connects directly
        - from (1,0) move to (2,0)
        - from (2,0) move to (3,0)
        - from (3,0) go to (3,1)
        - from (3,1) move to (3,2)
        - finally, from (3,2) move to the exit at (3,3)

5. **Validation**:
    - Double-checking from the adjacency listing, every move made:
        - (0,0) <-> (1,0) 
        - (2,0) <-> (3,0) 
        - (3,0) <-> (3,1) 
        - (3,1) <-> (3,2) 
        - (3,2) <-> (3,3) 
    - All these connections are valid per the adjacency list provided.

The resultant path does not cross any walls and is made only using adjacent cells as given in the adjacency list. It connects the origin directly to the target using the shortest and valid route.
