To solve this maze, we first need to understand its structure based on the given adjacency list. We start by identifying the connections:

- (2,0) connected to (1,0) and (3,0)
- (1,3) connected to (0,3) and (2,3), and (1,2)
- (0,2) connected to (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2)
- (3,1) connected to (2,1) and (3,0), and (3,2)
- (0,1) connected to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (2,1) connected to (3,1), (1,1), and (2,2)
- (1,2) connected to (1,1), (2,2), and (0,2)
- (2,3) connected to (3,3), (1,3), and (2,2)
- (3,3) connected to (2,3) and (3,2)
- (1,1) connected to (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2)
- (1,0) connected to (2,0), and (1,1)
- (3,0) connected to (3,1), and (2,0)
- (3,2) connected to (3,3), and (2,2)
- (2,2) connected to (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,2)

With the entry point at (0,0), and the exit at (3,3), we must find a path from the origin to the target.

We'll explore possible routes using Breadth First Search, which guarantees that the shortest path is found if one exists because it explores all paths of length n before exploring paths of length n+1.
Follow the path as:
1. Start at (0,0), connected to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), options are (1,2), (0,3). Choosing (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3) which is the target.

This path only uses the adjacency connections provided and makes a valid path from entry to exit, moving through adjacent cells only with no jumps over walls or gaps.

Hence, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This ensures the path does not cross any walls and only consists of adjacent cells in the maze.
