<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind Solution:**

1. The origin of the maze is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).
2. Using the adjacency list provided:
   - From the origin (0,0), the connected cell is (0,1).
   - From (0,1), you can move to (0,2), keeping in the same row and moving to the right.
   - From (0,2), you can move downward to (1,2) since these cells are connected.
   - Continuing downward is not possible directly to (3,2). However, (1,2) is also connected to (2,2), allowing a downward movement.
   - From (2,2), move to (3,2) which follows directly below. This is permissible as they are connected.
   - Finally, move from (3,2) directly rightward to reach (3,3), the target.

**Cross-check against provided adjacency list for allowed passages and direct connections:**
- Each move from the chosen path is verified against the adjacency list to ensure there's a proper link between the consecutive cells, confirming no walls are crossed.
- All the moves use only directly connected adjacent cells as designated in the given maze structure.
