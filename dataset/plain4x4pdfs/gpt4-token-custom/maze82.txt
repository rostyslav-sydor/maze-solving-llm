To find the solution to the maze, I constructed an adjacency list based on the information given and then performed a breadth-first search (BFS) from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). BFS is an appropriate choice for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this one, where each step between nodes (here, adjacent cells in the maze) has equal weight.

1. **Constructing the adjacency list:**
   - Each node (a coordinate pair) has an entry listing the other nodes to which it is directly connected.
   - This list provided includes edges like (3,3) <--> (2,3) and so forth, forming a graph where each node connects to its neighboring passable cell in the maze.

2. **BFS Algorithm:**
   - I initialized BFS from the origin (0,0), keeping track of visited nodes and the path taken to reach each node.
   - BFS explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which ensures the shortest path is found in an unweighted scenario.
   - A queue was maintained to add and process nodes in the order they should be explored, and a predecessor list was maintained where each node remembers the node from which it came for the purpose of reconstructing the path once the target (3,3) is reached.

3. **Checking for solution validity:**
   - After reconstructing the path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the predecessor list, I traced the path from the BFS output to ensure every move goes from one node to an adjacent connected node, verifying that the path doesn't cross any walls or use non-adjacent cells.

4. **Constructing the output:**
   - Starting from (0,0), the BFS exploration leads to (0,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and finally (3,3) based on the interconnected cells.

The final valid path found is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The connections used in this path:
- (0,0) to (0,1) is valid
- (0,1) to (1,1) is valid
- (1,1) to (1,2) is valid
- (1,2) to (2,2) is valid
- (2,2) to (3,3) is valid

Thus, each step of the solution adheres to the rules of the adjacency list, ensuring it's free from crossing any walls and maintains adjacency at every step.
