<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning Behind the Calculations:
1. Start at the origin (0,0), the only available path directly from the origin is to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the next accessible coordinates are (1,1) as per the adjacency list.
3. Proceeding from (1,1) to (1,2), this move is valid following the paired relationship in the adjacency list.
4. From (1,2), move to (2,2) since these coordinates are connected.
5. Next move to (3,2) from (2,2), which is a valid connection in the adjacency list.
6. Finally, move from (3,2) to the target (3,3).

### Checking the Solution:
Verify that the path only follows the connections denoted in the adjacency list:
- **(0,0) to (0,1)**: valid as per adjacency (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- **(0,1) to (1,1)**: valid as per adjacency (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- **(1,1) to (1,2)**: valid as per adjacency (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- **(1,2) to (2,2)**: valid as per adjacency (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- **(2,2) to (3,2)**: valid as per adjacency (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- **(3,2) to (3,3)**: valid as per adjacency (3,2) <--> (3,3)

The suggested path does not cross any walls, and each transition between cells is justified by the adjacency list provided.
