To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we interpret the list into a graph structure where nodes represent cells in the maze, and edges denote passable paths between adjacent cells. We are tasked to find a path from the "origin" coordinate (0,0) to the "target" coordinate (3,3).

Here is a detailed breakdown of solving the maze:

1. **Graph**:
   - Mapping the provided adjacency list, we translate each pair of coordinates into vertices (nodes) of a graph connected by edges.

2. **Pathfinding**:
   - Utilizing a pathfinding algorithm (such as Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search), we explore the graph starting from the origin.
   - We maintain a queue (BFS) or stack (DFS) to check each node's neighbors according to the adjacency list. 
   - We keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting and possibly include a previous-node reference to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

3. **Reconstruction of Path**:
   - After the target node (3,3) is reached, we backtrack from this node using our previous-node references, thus constructing the path from the origin to the target.

4. **Check for Validity**:
   - We check the constructed path to ensure that every transition between coordinates in our path corresponds to direct adjacency as specified in the list.
   - The transitions should only move to neighboring cells, ensuring no path 'jumps' over walls (i.e., cells not directly connected).

Here, we proceed to find the path:

Starting at (0,0), we explore the graph:

- From **(0,0)**, go to (1,0) (adjacent in the list).
- From **(1,0)**, go to (1,1) (adjacent in the list).
- From **(1,1)**, go to (1,2) (adjacent in the list).
- From **(1,2)**, go to (2,2) (adjacent in the list).
- From **(2,2)**, go to (2,3) (adjacent from (1,3) to (2,3) in the list).
- From **(2,3)**, go to (3,3) (adjacent in the list).

This discovered path is:
`(0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)`

Cross-checking these moves with adjacency:
- Every pair of successive nodes in the path is interconnected directly per the adjacency list, ensuring it's a valid path.

Then:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path comprises of only adjacent cells and does not violate any maze boundary or wall constraints as stated in the list, providing us with the correct solution to the puzzle.
