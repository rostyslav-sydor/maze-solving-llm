The given adjacency list represents a maze where each coordinate pair is connected to its adjacent allowable moves. To solve the maze, we start from the provided origin `(0,0)` and aim to reach the target `(3,3)`.

1. **Understanding the Maze Structure**: 
   The provided adjacency list shows all possible movements between connected cells. By reading the provided list, I map out which cells are directly connected.

2. **Finding the Path**:
   - Start from `(0,0)`
   - Using available moves in the adjacency list, prioritize movement towards the target `(3,3)` while avoiding revisiting cells.

   Moving sequences:
   - From `(0,0)` move to `(1,0)` `(using connection (0,0) <--> (1,0))`
   - From `(1,0)` move to `(2,0)` `(using connection (1,0) <--> (2,0))`
   - From `(2,0)` move to `(2,1)` `(using connection (2,0) <--> (2,1))`
   - From `(2,1)` move to `(2,2)` `(using connection (2,1) <--> (2,2))`
   - From `(2,2)` move to `(3,2)` `(using connection (2,2) <--> (3,2))`
   - From `(3,2)` move to `(3,3)` `(using connection (3,2) <--> (3,3))`

   This path avoids wall crossings and uses only adjacent cells as per the adjacency list.

3. **Verification**:
   - Ensure each step in the path only goes to adjacent nodes as specified in the adjacency list.
   - Check no walls are crossed, meaning each step adheres to the pairs given in the adjacency list.
   - Double-check no cells are revisited, reaffirming path efficiency.

Finally, the formulated path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path uses only permissible connections provided in the maze structure and meets the origin-to-target requirements.
