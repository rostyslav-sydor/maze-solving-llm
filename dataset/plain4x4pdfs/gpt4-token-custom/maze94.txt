To solve the maze provided, I'll first reconstruct the adjacency list into a more readable format and identify the entry and exit points. Then, I'll use a breadth-first search strategy to find the shortest path from the entry (origin) to the exit (target).

#### Reconstructed Adjacency List of the Maze:
1. (3,2) <--> (3,3)
2. (2,0) <--> (2,1)
3. (2,2) <--> (1,2)
4. (2,0) <--> (3,0)
5. (0,3) <--> (0,2)
6. (2,2) <--> (2,3)
7. (3,2) <--> (2,2)
8. (1,1) <--> (1,0)
9. (1,2) <--> (1,3)
10. (0,1) <--> (0,0)
11. (3,2) <--> (3,1)
12. (2,1) <--> (2,2)
13. (0,1) <--> (0,2)
14. (1,1) <--> (0,1)
15. (0,0) <--> (1,0)
16. (0,3) <--> (1,3)
17. (3,1) <--> (2,1)
18. (1,2) <--> (0,2)
19. (2,1) <--> (1,1)
20. (1,3) <--> (2,3)

#### Entry and Exit Points:
- **Origin**: (0,0)
- **Target**: (3,3)

#### Strategy to Solve Using Breadth-First Search (BFS):
1. **Begin** at the origin (0,0).
2. **Visit** and **enqueue** each directly connected room (node).
3. **Mark** each visited room to avoid revisiting.
4. For each room, **check if** it is the **exit** point. If not, continue to the next.
5. **Store** the path taken to potentially backtrack and find the shortest way to the target.
6. Continue until you find the shortest path or exhaust all possibilities.

#### Calculating the Path:
- Start from (0,0).
- Adjacent are (0,1) and (1,0).
- Proceed to (0,1), next possibilities are (0,0) (backtrack, ignore), (0,2), (1,1).
- Then to (0,2), adjacent paths lead to (0,1) (backtrack, ignore), (0,3), (1,2).
- Then to (1,2), can lead to (0,2) (backtrack, ignore), (2,2), (1,3).
- (2,2) leads to (1,2) (backtrack, ignore), (2,3), (3,2).
- From (3,2) to (3,3), which is the exit.

#### Final Path:
- (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3)

#### Validation:
Each move involves adjacent cells, and no turns explicitly break the adjacency rules of the given list. No walls are crossed as all moves use the links explicitly laid out in the adjacency list.

#### Output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path solutions validates according to the adjacency list and correctly follows a breadth-first search algorithm starting from the origin and ending at the designated target.
