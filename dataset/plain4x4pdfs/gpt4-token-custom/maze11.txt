**Maze Representation and Parsing:**
The adjacency list defines all the direct connections (passages) between points in the maze, where each pair of connected nodes are defined bi-directionally, for instance, `(0,0) <--> (1,0)` implies you can move from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)` and vice versa.

The maze's entry point is `(0,0)` and the exit is `(3,3)`. My task is to find a valid path from the origin to the target that follows the adjacency rules defined.

**Path Finding Process:**
To solve this, I'll use a method similar to Breadth-First Search (BFS), which efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph:
1. Start at the origin `(0,0)`, initializing a queue with this starting node, and mark it as visited.
2. Expand to all adjacent nodes using the adjacency list, each time marking new nodes as visited and adding them to a path tracking structure.
3. Continue this expansion until the target `(3,3)` is reached or all possible paths are explored.

From the adjacency list, here is the possible expansion sequence:
- Starting from `(0,0)`, valid moves are to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
- Continuing from `(0,1)`, progress can be made to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)` you can move to `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`.
- Following the path further, from `(1,2)` moves can be made to `(0,2)`, `(2,2)`.
- From `(2,2)`, next feasible steps are along `(2,1)`, `(2,3)`.
- Continuing from `(2,3)` to `(3,3)`, which is the maze's exit.

**Path Calculation and Validation:**
- Starting from `(0,0)`, progress through `(0,1)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, and finally to `(3,3)`.
- Properly following the adjacency connections, no walls (unlisted connections) are crossed and all moves are between direct neighbors (connected cells).

This results in the shortest path while adhering to the maze's rules:

**Output path:**<br>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path has been cross-checked for mistakes:
1. No backtracking or looping unnecessarily.
2. No connections are utilized that aren't defined in the adjacency list.
3. The path utilizes only adjacent cells defined by the list, ensuring no "wall crossing".
