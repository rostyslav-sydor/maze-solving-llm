<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning Behind the Calculation:

1. **Construct the Maze Graph**: Analyze the adjacency list to create a graph structure representing the maze as a set of connections between cells represented by coordinates.

2. **Origin and Target Setting**: Determine the origin point as (0,0) and the target point as (3,3) from the specified tokens.

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use a pathfinding algorithm such as BFS (Breadth-First Search) because of its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, which is suitable for mazes.

4. **BFS Steps**:
   - Initiate BFS from the origin (0,0).
   - Progress level by level (adjacent cells) maintaining a queue.
   - For each cell, check all its adjacent cells (connections defined in the adjacency list).
   - Continue this process until reaching the target point (3,3).

5. **Validate and Document the Path**:
   - Track the path from (0,0) to (3,3) documenting each move according to valid connections from the adjacency list.
   - Ensure no connections outside the defined list in <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens are used, and all movements are to immediately adjacent cells in the graph structure.

6. **Resulting Path**: Produce the path by outputting the coordinating traversal from start to end making certain it adheres to given adjacency constraints. The result, therefore, is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> where each transition represents a valid move in the maze avoiding walls and ensuring immediate adjacency.

This path is validated such that:
- It starts at the origin.
- It finishes at the target.
- Every step moves to an adjacent coordinate connected as per the adjacency list.
- It does not backtrack or traverse any walls between cells.

The result provides a shortest path from the entry to the exit of the maze by leveraging all possible moves as allowed in the maze's structure and layout.
