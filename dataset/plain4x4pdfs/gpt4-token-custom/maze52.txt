Based on the given adjacency list, the maze can be interpreted as a graph where each pair of coordinates represents the cells of the maze, and an edge between them indicates that a direct path is available. The goal is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the edges provided in the adjacency list.

**Step-by-step Pathfinding Process**:

1. **Starting Point**: Origin is at (0,0).

2. **Identify Adjacent Nodes**: From (0,0), the adjacency list informs us that the next possible cells we can traverse to are:
   - (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1)
   
3. **Move to (0,1)** and analyze further paths:
   - From (0,1), we can go to (0,0) - backtracking, or move forward to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2).
   
4. **Move to (0,2)** and check available paths:
   - Options are back to (0,1) or forward to (0,3) via (0,2) <--> (0,3)
   
5. **Proceed to (0,3)** and look for connections:
   - We can move to either (0,2) - which would be backtracking, or (1,3) via (1,3) <--> (0,3)
   
6. **Continue to (1,3)**:
   - From here, we can go back to (0,3) or ahead to (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (1,3)

7. **Travel to (1,2)**:
   - This leads back to (1,3) or to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (1,2)

8. **Move to (2,2)**:
   - We can circle back to (1,2) or proceed to either (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (2,2) or (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (2,2)
   
9. **Move to (2,3)**:
   - This path takes us back to (2,2) or forward to (3,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3)

10. **Finally reach (3,3)**, which is the target.

**Constructed Path**: The identified path based on adjacency, moving only to adjacent cells and not crossing any walls, will be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path transitions through permissible moves described in the adjacency list, logically connects from start to finish, and doesn't backtrack except when transitioning between root branches. Each move is to a coordinate directly connected by the edges listed, ensuring the path conforms to the maze structure. Hence, the solution is viable and traverses the maze correctly.
