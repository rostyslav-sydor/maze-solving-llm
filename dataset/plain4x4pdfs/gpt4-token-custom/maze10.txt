To solve the given maze problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Construct the Graph from the Adjacency List**: We will map the maze as a graph where each cell `(x,y)` corresponds to a node and edges represent allowable moves between cells.

2. **Identify the Entry and Exit Points**: From the problem statement, it's clear that the starting point is `(0,0)` and the target point is `(3,3)`.

3. **Graph Traversal to Find Path from Entry to Exit**: Using a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for unweighted graphs like this, we'll search for the shortest path from the start to the target.

4. **Output the Path**: We'll then format the resulting path within the required token structure.

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### Graph Construction
- Presented in the adjacency list format, the edges are:
  ```
  (2,1) <--> (2,2), (2,3) <--> (3,3), (3,2) <--> (3,1), (1,2) <--> (0,2),
  (0,2) <--> (0,3), (3,0) <--> (3,1), (2,1) <--> (3,1), (2,0) <--> (1,0),
  (1,0) <--> (1,1), (1,2) <--> (2,2), (2,1) <--> (1,1), (2,3) <--> (1,3),
  (0,1) <--> (1,1), (0,3) <--> (1,3), (3,0) <--> (2,0), (3,2) <--> (3,3),
  (2,0) <--> (2,1), (0,1) <--> (0,0)
  ```

#### Using BFS for Pathfinding
- Starting from `(0,0)`, explore the neighbors and record paths till we reach `(3,3)`.
- On the way, mark visited nodes to avoid cycles.

#### Constructing the Path Output
- Upon finding the path using BFS, the explored nodes sequence gives the solution path from `(0,0)` directly to `(3,3)`.

#### Path Check (Verifying Solution)
- With the reconstructed path, we validate that each step taken is a direct neighbor to the previous step as per the adjacency list data. This assures us that no walls are crossed and each move adheres to the adjacency relations given.

### Final Output
- Assuming BFS was employed correctly and a path was identified, format the found path:
  ```
  <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
  ```
Given the constraints and operations allowed in the adjacency list, this path does not violate any conditions. Each step transitions directly to an adjacent cell connected by an edge.
