<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to adjacent (0,1) through direct edge.
3. Continue to (0,2) from (0,1) using the edges listed.
4. Move to (0,3) from (0,2) using the direct adjacency.
5. Travel to (1,3) from (0,3).
6. Proceed to (2,3) using the adjacency between (1,3) and (2,3).
7. Reach the target (3,3) from (2,3).

**Path Description:**
- This path is linear, following edges in the adjacency list sequentially starting from the entry point to the exit.
- Each move is between adjacent cells in the adjacency list, ensuring no walls are crossed.
- The path directly progresses from left to right on the top row, then directly down from (0,3) to (3,3) on the third column, representing a valid pathway through the maze according to given adjacencies.
