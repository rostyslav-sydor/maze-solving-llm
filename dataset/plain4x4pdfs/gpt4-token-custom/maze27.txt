To solve this maze challenge, represented as an adjacency list of connected nodes (coordinates), I will use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). I will mentally visualize each connection and iterate through possible paths starting from the designated origin to the designated target, ensuring that adjacent moves follow the connections specified in the adjacency list.

Given the adjacency list, the maze structure is as follows (simplified for visual understanding):

```
0: (0,0) - (1,0); (0,1) - (0,2); (0,2) - (1,2); (0,3) - (1,3)
1: (1,0) - (1,1); (1,1) - (0,1); (1,3) - (2,3); (1,3) - (0,3); (1,2) - (2,2); (1,2) - (1,3)
2: (2,0) - (2,1); (2,0) - (3,0); (2,1) - (3,1); (2,1) - (2,2); (2,2) - (3,2); (2,2) - (2,3)
3: (3,2) - (3,1); (3,2) - (3,3); (3,2) - (2,2); (2,3) - (3,3)
```
Entry is (0,0) and exit is (3,3).

Starting from (0,0), the connected path options are:
- Connected direct neighbors: (1,0)
  - Next from (1,0): (1,1)
    - Next from (1,1): (0,1)
      - etc... until we look to find (3,3)

Using BFS or DFS to navigate through the paths:

```
(0,0) -> (1,0)
(1,0) -> (1,1)
(1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)
(0,2) -> (1,2)
(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)
(2,3) -> (3,3)
```

This path traverses the nodes in accordance with the adjacency rules provided. Now, check for the correctness:
1. Every move is between adjacent and connected nodes as per the adjacency list.
2. There are no backtracks to previously visited nodes that would indicate an invalid path.
3. No walls are crossed based on non-listed adjacent moves.

Thus, your path from (0,0) to (3,3), following the recognized adjacency connections, is both valid and successful. Below is the maze solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution adheres strictly to the adjacency relations detailed in the original graph description and brings the searcher from the defined origin to the target.
