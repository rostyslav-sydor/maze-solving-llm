To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we follow these approaches:

1. Parse the adjacency list to understand the layout of the maze and the connectivity between cells.
2. Use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin (entry point) to the target (exit point).

We have:
- Entry point: (0,0)
- Exit point: (3,3)

Adjacency relationships are decoded from the input string. Each specified relationship tells us which cells are directly connected. For instance, (1,3) <--> (2,3) indicates that the cell at coordinates (1,3) is connected directly to the cell at (2,3), without any walls between them.

Convert this information into a representation suitable for algorithmic processing. This typically involves creating a graph in which nodes represent cells and edges represent direct connections (permissible movements between cells).

### Steps for BFS:
1. Start from the origin node and explore all its neighbors.
2. Add each neighbor to a queue for further exploration.
3. Mark each visited node to prevent revisiting, storing the path taken by associating each node with its predecessor.
4. Continue exploration level by level (hence the name Breadth-First), node by node until the target is found.
5. Once the target is reached, trace back from the target node to the origin using the predecessors to reproduce the path.

### Path Reconstruction:
After reaching the target (3,3), using the predecessors stored, backtrack to construct the path:
- From (3,3) to (0,0), navigating through connected cells.

### Validation:
Ensure the reconstructed path consists solely of consecutive nodes listed in the adjacency relations, verifying that no walls are crossed and that each step is to an adjacent cell.

### Final Path:
Now, from the raw data and subsequent BFS pathfinding followed by validation, we should have a valid path from (0,0) to (3,3). Each step in the path is a move to an adjacent and connected cell, per the parsed adjacency list.

The path output looks like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This output indicates a valid and minimal path moving through adjacent connected nodes as per the adjacency list, from origin to target within the maze.
