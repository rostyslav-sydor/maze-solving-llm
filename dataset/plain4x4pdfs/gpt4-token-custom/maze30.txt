<ADJLIST_START> (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (2,2) <--> (1,2) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Given the adjacency list description of the graph and the entrance (0,0) and exit (3,3), we aim to find a valid path. We will take the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Graph Representation**: The maze is provided in the form of an adjacency list where each tuple pair represents a passable path between two coordinates. 

2. **Identifying the Path**:
   - Starting from the entry point (0,0), observe that there is a connection from (0,0) to (0,1).
   - Move from (0,1) to explore neighborhood cells, and we find a path to (1,1).
   - From (1,1), there's also a direct connection to (1,2).
   - Continue moving through the connected path (1,2) to (1,3).
   - From (1,3), move to (2,3) as per available connections.
   - Finally, from (2,3) move to the target (3,3).

3. **Path Verification**:
   - Ensure the path moves stepwise without skipping any nodes or breaking walls: Check each stepâ€™s existence in the adjacency list.
   - Validate that subsequent moves are directly connected as per the adjacency list provided.

4. **Compiling the Path**:
   - The path traced using the given adjacency is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

5. **Result**:
   - We have validated that this path is indeed connected as per the adjacency list and does not cross any omitted nodes or walls.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates successfully navigates from the entrance to the exit of the maze while adhering to the path constraints provided by the adjacency list.
