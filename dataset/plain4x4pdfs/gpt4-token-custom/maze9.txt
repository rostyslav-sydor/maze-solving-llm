To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, I will perform breadth-first search (BFS), a standard graph traversal algorithm that can find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

1. **Parse the Adjacency List**: The maze's graph structure from the adjacency list is:
   - `(1,0) <--> (0,0)`, `(2,2) <--> (2,1)`, `(1,2) <--> (0,2)`, `(1,1) <--> (0,1)`, `(1,3) <--> (1,2)`,
   - `(2,3) <--> (3,3)`, `(3,2) <--> (2,2)`, `(3,3) <--> (3,2)`, `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`, `(0,1) <--> (0,0)`,
   - `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`, `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`, `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`, `(3,1) <--> (3,0)`, `(0,3) <--> (0,2)`,
   - `(1,3) <--> (2,3)`, `(0,2) <--> (0,1)`, `(2,2) <--> (2,3)`.
   
   These pairs represent direct connections (edges) between nodes (cells in the maze).

2. **Identify Entry and Exit**: As given, the origin (entry point) is `(0,0)` and the target (exit point) is `(3,3)`.

3. **Execute the BFS Algorithm**:
   - Start from the node `(0,0)` and explore all adjacent nodes moving level by level.
   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
   - Use a queue to hold nodes to visit and a dictionary to track the path back from each visited node to its predecessor.

4. **Reconstruct the Path**:
   - Once we reach the target `(3,3)`, backtrack using the predecessors recorded to construct the path from origin to the target.
   - Start from the target and prepend each node's predecessor until the origin is reached.

Based on these steps, following is the path found:

- Begin at `(0,0)` --> explore `(1,0)`
- From `(1,0)` --> explore `(1,1)`
- From `(1,1)` --> explore `(2,1)`
- From `(2,1)` --> explore `(2,2)`
- From `(2,2)` --> explore `(3,2)`
- From `(3,2)` --> explore `(3,3)`, which is the exit

Path reconstructed by backtracking from `(3,3)` to `(0,0)`:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

**Final Validation**:
- Each consecutive node in the path is directly connected according to the adjacency list, conforming to the constraints of not crossing any walls and using only adjacent cells.
