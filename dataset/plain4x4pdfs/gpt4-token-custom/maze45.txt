To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using the connections described in the adjacency list. I will begin by establishing a graph from the adjacency list and then use a graph traversal algorithm to find the shortest path.

### Analyzing the Adjacency List
From the provided adjacency list, I construct the graph with edges showing possible moves:
- (3,3) ↔ (2,3)
- (1,1) ↔ (1,2)
- (1,0) ↔ (1,1)
- (1,3) ↔ (2,3)
- (2,2) ↔ (2,3)
- (1,3) ↔ (0,3)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,2)
- (2,1) ↔ (1,1)
- (1,3) ↔ (1,2)
- (2,0) ↔ (2,1)
- (0,0) ↔ (1,0)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,0)
- (0,1) ↔ (0,2)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,2)
- (0,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (3,3) ↔ (3,2)
- (0,0) ↔ (0,1)
- (3,1) ↔ (2,1)
- (2,0) ↔ (3,0)

### Graph Traversal
Using breadth-first search (BFS), a suitable method for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one, we can explore the paths from (0,0).

### BFS Execution:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move to connected nodes: (1,0), (0,1).
   
  From (1,0):
  - Move to (1,1).

    From (1,1):
    - Move to (1,2).
      
      From (1,2):
      - Move to (1,3), (0,2).
        
        From (1,3):
        - Move to (2,3), (0,3).
          
          From (2,3):
          - Move to (2,2), (3,3) ← **found the exit.**

3. Reconstruct the path from (0,0) to (3,3):
   - (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).

### Final Path Verification
Using the list of connections and our resulting path, now we check:
- Each step in the path must be directly connected according to the adjacency list.
- All pairs (consecutive coordinates in our path) should match an edge in the list:

  (0,0) ↔ (1,0),
  (1,0) ↔ (1,1),
  (1,1) ↔ (1,2),
  (1,2) ↔ (1,3),
  (1,3) ↔ (2,3),
  (2,3) ↔ (3,3).

All these pairs are indeed present in the adjacency list.

### Output in Required Format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path meets all the requirements: It starts at the origin, ends at the target, and uses valid connections without crossing any walls. The use of BFS ensures it's one of the shortest paths possible given the constraints.
