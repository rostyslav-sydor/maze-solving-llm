Based on the adjacency list provided, I will construct a graph where each coordinate pair (tuple) represents a node and an edge exists between two nodes if they are directly connected. The adjacency list essentially represents all direct connections as paths in a maze. I will use a searching algorithm to navigate this graph from the origin to the target.

1. Parse the adjacency pairs to form the graph:
   - For example, "(2,3) <--> (3,3)" denotes an edge between cell (2,3) and (3,3).

2. Use a searching algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) which is suitable for unweighted graphs like this one to find the shortest path from the origin to the destination:
   - Start from origin (0,0) and explore all reachable nodes using the connections given until the destination (3,3) is found.
  
3. Keep track of the paths to ensure the BFS covers the shortest route first, guaranteeing that we find the optimal path as soon as it finds the destination.

### Solution Pathfinding Steps
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start from `(0,0)`.
   - The graph's edges are bidirectional as indicated by `<-->`, meaning each pair can be traversed both ways.

2. **Exploring Adjacent Nodes**:
   - From `(0,0)`, look to directly connected nodes: `(1,0)`.
   - Then from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`.
   - Continue explore following the graph connections.

3. **Tracking the Path**:
   - Maintain a record of the path taken from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` ensuring to move solely to directly connected nodes.
   - Avoid any movements that deviate from the adjacency list, ensuring walls are not crossed and paths are correctly followed through adjacent relations.

4. **Completing the Path**:
   - The final path traverses through a sequence of nodes leading directly from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`, based on direct adjacency alone.

### Solution
Checking the adjacency list and sequentially connecting paths:

- Path from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)` via direct connection. 
- Then, continue from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`; and so on, following connections provided in the adjacency list, ensuring at each step that a direct connection (and thus a valid path in the maze) exists.

Considering the connections, an example path that fits the adjacency constraints and reaches the end point `(3,3)` would be:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path correctly follows directly connected cells and adheres to navigating through all available paths as per the maze's design given in the adjacency list. Each move steps to an adjacent node without leaping over any undefined connections, thereby ensuring no walls are crossed inadvertently.
