To solve the maze presented in the description, we can employ a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Convert the Adjacency List to a Graph**:
    - The adjacency list represents connections between nodes in the maze, where each node is a coordinate (row, column).
    - We map out these connections in a dictionary format to represent the graph. Each key (node) has a list of directly connected nodes (accessible paths).

2. **Initialize BFS**:
    - We start BFS from the origin point, which is (0,0).
    - We maintain a queue to explore nodes level by level, beginning with the origin.
    - We also maintain a dictionary `parents` to track the path, recording nodes' predecessors.

3. **Explore Nodes**:
    - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, explore all its directly connected nodes.
    - For each connected node, if it hasn't been visited (not present in `parents`), we mark its parent (the node from which we reached it) and enqueue it.
    - Repeat until the queue is empty or the target node (exit point) is reached.

4. **Construct the Path**:
    - If we reach the target node (3,3), we backtrack using the `parents` dictionary from the target to the origin to construct the path.

5. **Validation**:
    - The final path is checked to ensure each step moves to an adjacent coordinate and doesn't bypass any walls as described in the initial adjacency list.

Let's see the BFS in our graph:

Starting at (0,0), we explore the adjacent (1,0). Repeat BFS from (1,0) and then next nodes until you get to the target. Following this approach and exploring nodes iteratively:

- From **(0,0)** -> to **(1,0)** (adjacent and direct connection).
- From **(1,0)** -> to **(1,1)** (adjacent node).
- From **(1,1)** -> to **(1,2)** (still adjacent, all moves allowed).
- Keep moving to **(1,3)** -> Then **(2,3)** -> and finally **(3,3)**.

Now let's construct the path:

Based on BFS, you traverse:
- (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Simplified Path:
- <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows all connections in the maze without violating any wall constraints. Each move from a node to the next is valid, with coordinates differing by a single increment, confirming validity and connectivity based on the adjacency provided.
