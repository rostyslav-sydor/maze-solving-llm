To solve the maze given above, first, we will interpret the adjacency list to represent the maze in a graph structure where each node will represent a coordinate in the maze, and a connection between two nodes will represent that you can travel directly between these two coordinates.

The adjacency list from the data looks like:
<ADJLIST_START>
(2,2) <--> (1,2) ;
(2,3) <--> (3,3) ;
(3,2) <--> (3,1) ;
(3,1) <--> (2,1) ;
(0,0) <--> (1,0) ;
(2,3) <--> (1,3) ;
(2,0) <--> (2,1) ;
(1,0) <--> (2,0) ;
(1,1) <--> (0,1) ;
(1,3) <--> (0,3) ;
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ;
(0,1) <--> (0,0) ;
(1,2) <--> (1,1) ;
(2,1) <--> (2,2) ;
(2,0) <--> (3,0) ;
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ;
(3,2) <--> (3,3) ;
<ADJLIST_END>

We will use these connections to move from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). A pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) can effectively tackle such problems.

1. Starting from (0,0), check the adjacency list to find where (0,0) connects. Movement is allowed to (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From (0,1), further movement is allowed to (1,1).
3. Repeat the process, following connections from the current node to an adjacent node satisfying the adjacency from the list, aiming to reach close to the target coordinate (3,3):
   - Move from (0,1) to (1,1)
   - Then to (1,2)
   - From (1,2), move to (2,2)
   - From (2,2), move to (2,1)
   - Connect from (2,1) to (3,1)
   - Move from (3,1) to (3,2)
   - Finally from (3,2) to (3,3), the target.

Each step only moves to an adjacent square in accordance with the adjacency list. After determining a viable path, it should be confirmed that no steps violate the adjacency restrictions.

Summarizing the calculated path:
<PATH_START> 
(0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) 
<PATH_END> 

This solution adheres to the constraints given by the adjacency list and achieves a path from the origin to the target using valid, adjacent steps.
