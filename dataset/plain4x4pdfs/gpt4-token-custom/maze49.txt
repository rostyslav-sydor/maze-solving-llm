<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind the Calculations:**

1. **Graph Representation**: We translate the given adjacency list into a visual/mental representation, or potentially a data structure like an adjacency list in Python, which maps each cell as a node and corridors that lead to another room (node) as edges. 

2. **Starting Point**: The origin is given as (0,0) and we look for possible moves:
   - From adjacency connections, (0,0) is directly connected to (0,1).

3. **Path Exploration**: Using a breadth-first search approach (BFS) or a depth-first search (DFS), we explore paths from the origin:
   - Move from (0,0) to (0,1). From there, the next possible connected node is (0,2) without hitting any walls.
   - Continue from (0,2) to (0,3), respecting the given adjacency, which shows a direct connection.
   - At (0,3), the next adjacency is (1,3), so proceed vertically down.
   - From (1,3) to (2,3) and finally from (2,3) to (3,3) as all are directly connected.

4. **End Point**: Target or exit is set at (3,3), and the path chosen reaches this point without hitting walls or visiting non-adjacent squares.

5. **Checking Path Integrity**: The defined path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent, directly connected nodes, respecting the adjacency list's constraints. Hence, all movements are valid with no illegal transitions between non-connected points.

6. **Efficiency and Validation**: The selected path is direct and likely optimal as it uses straight movements until a blockage or endpoint redirection, minimizing turns and backtracking. Each step is checked against the adjacency list to make sure that every step is legal (i.e., connections exist in the given adjacency list).
