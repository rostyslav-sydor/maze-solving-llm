To solve the maze, we start with the adjacency list of the maze to build a representation in which we determine how the paths are connected. Then, we'll use a graph traversal algorithm, like Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the start point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Convert the adjacency list to a graph**: Each pair is added to a graph representation where each cell is connected to its adjacent cells as described in the adjacency list.

2. **Identify start and end points**: Start point is (0,0) and end point is (3,3).

3. **Pathfinding using BFS**:
   - Initiate BFS from the start point (0,0).
   - Queue each explored node along with its current path.
   - Continue exploring each adjacent node if it has not been visited.
   - If the exit point (3,3) is reached, the current path is the solution.
   
4. **Checking for solution validity**:
   - Ensure that each successive node in the path is directly connected via the maze's adjacency list (this will be inherently ensured if BFS is properly implemented using the adjacency list).

Here is the path derived from BFS given the maze connections:

- Start from (0,0) which connects to (0,1).
- (0,1) to (0,2).
- (0,2) to (0,3).
- (0,3) to (1,3).
- (1,3) to (2,3).
- (2,3) to (3,3).

Let's document the path ensuring each step maintains adjacency with no walls crossed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

All connections between these points are directly present in the adjacency list, confirming the path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent cells directly connected per the given adjacency list. Thus, this is a valid path from start to end in the maze.
