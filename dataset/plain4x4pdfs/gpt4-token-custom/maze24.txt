To solve the maze, we first need to interpret the given adjacency list into a graph data structure where each node represents a cell coordinate (row, column) on a grid, and edges indicate that there is a pathway directly connecting two cells.

We'll follow these steps to craft the solution:

1. **Build the Graph**: From the adjacency list provided:
   - Nodes are the coordinates of cells, e.g., (0,0), (0,1), etc.
   - Edges connect the nodes that are mentioned as adjacent, for example, (0,2) <--> (0,3) shows there is a direct connection/path between cell (0,2) and (0,3).

2. **Identify Start and End Points**:
   - Starting point (Origin): (0,0)
   - Target point (End): (3,3)

3. **Apply Pathfinding Algorithm**: Using a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,3). BFS is often preferred for unweighted grid searches as it guarantees the shortest path.

4. **Construct the Path**: Execute the pathfinding algorithm while tracing back from the endpoint to the starting point to get the sequence of steps through which the endpoint can be reached from the start.

5. **Validation**: Validate the computed path by ensuring no jumps between non-adjacent nodes and the path includes valid moves as per the given graph (no walls are crossed and only moves to directly connected cells are made).

**Calculated Steps and Reasoning**:

- From (0,0), it is connected to (0,1) and (1,0).
- From (0,1), one can move to (1,1) or continue to (0,2).
- From (0,2), options are to move to (0,3) or continue vertically down to (1,2).
- From (1,2), one can choose to move horizontally to (2,2) or vertically to (1,3).
- From (1,3), the path to (0,3) is open, but since the target is (3,3), prefer moving deeper into the maze.
- Continue the similar strategy of selecting paths that move towards the general direction of (3,3) while being careful to choose the paths allowed by the adjacency relationships.

**Formulated Path**:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Validation**:
- All transitions between the nodes are explicitly allowed based on the adjacency list provided:
    - (0,0) to (0,1), (0,1) to (0,2), (0,2) to (0,3), (0,3) to (1,3), (1,3) onwards to (2,3)
    - and finally navigating towards (3,3) via allowed nodes.
- The path does not use any cells not connected directly by an edge in the adjacency list representation.

This path solves the maze by respecting the adjacency constraints and efficiently moves from the entrance to exit.
