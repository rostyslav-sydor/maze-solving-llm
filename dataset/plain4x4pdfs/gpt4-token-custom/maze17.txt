**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **First**, lets understand the adjacency list. It describes a graph where each pair represents a direct connection between nodes, and every node presents as a coordinate. These connections represent paths that do not have walls between them. 

2. **Identify Start and Target**: The given entry point (origin) of the maze is (0,0) and the exit point (target) is (3,3).

3. **Maze Graph Interpretation**:
   - From the adjacency list, the graph can be interpreted in terms of allowed moves between directly connected coordinates;
     ```
     (2,0) can move to [(1,0), (3,0), (2,1)]
     (1,0) can move to [(2,0), (1,1), (0,0)]
     (1,1) can move to [(1,0), (1,2), (0,1)]
     (2,1) can move to [(2,0), (2,2)]
     (3,0) can move to [(2,0), (3,1)]
     (3,1) can move to [(3,0), (3,2)]
     (3,2) can move to [(3,1), (2,2), (3,3)]
     (2,2) can move to [(2,1), (1,2), (3,2)]
     (1,2) can move to [(1,1), (1,3), (2,2)]
     (1,3) can move to [(0,3), (1,2)]
     (0,3) can move to [(1,3), (0,2)]
     (0,2) can move to [(0,3)]
     (0,1) can move to [(0,0), (1,1)]
     (0,0) can move to [(0,1), (1,0)]
     (3,3) can move to [(3,2), (2,3)]
     (2,3) moves to [(3,3)]
     ```

4. **Pathfinding**:
   - Using this graph, a pathfinding algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can identify a route from (0,0) to (3,3). Here I'll briefly outline a possible BFS traversal:

   - **Breadth-First Search Starting at `(0,0)`**:
     ```
     (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
     ```
     This BFS traversal visits each of these nodes in sequence, ensuring each move is to an adjacent cell in the graph above.

5. **Output Solution**:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```
 
6. **Verification**:
   - This path only travels through allowed moves in the maze:
     ```
     (0,0) to (0,1)
     (0,1) to (1,1)
     (1,1) to (1,2)
     (1,2) to (2,2)
     (2,2) to (3,2)
     (3,2) to (3,3)
     ```
   Each connection exists directly in the adjacency list, showing the solution is valid and doesn't cross any walls. Each move connects directly adjacent cells thus ensuring an unbroken path directly from the origin to the target.
