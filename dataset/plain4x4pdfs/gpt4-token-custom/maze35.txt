<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Explanation:

1. Start at the entry point: (0,0).
2. Connect to (1,0) using the adjacency (0,0) <--> (1,0).
3. Move from (1,0) to (2,0) via the adjacency (1,0) <--> (2,0).
4. Progress from (2,0) to (3,0) via the adjacency (2,0) <--> (3,0).
5. Continue to (3,1) using the adjacency (3,0) <--> (3,1).
6. Next, go to (3,2) through the connection (3,1) <--> (3,2).
7. Reach the exit point (3,3) using the adjacency (3,2) <--> (3,3).

Check:
- The solution path moves from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) while following the maze's adjacency list.
- No walls are crossed, as only direct connections (adjacencies) are used.
- All steps involve adjacent cells, validating the connectedness and correctness of the path solution.
