<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Analyzing the adjacency list, each pair of coordinates indicates that there is direct passage (or a path) between those points, with no walls obstructing path between connected cells.

2. We begin at the origin (0,0), as specified between <ORIGIN_START> and <ORIGIN_END>.

3. From (0,0), looking at adjacency data:
   - (0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0).

4. From (0,1), possibilities:
   - (0,1) connects to (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1).

5. Moving to (0,2):
   - (0,2) connects to (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2).

6. Then to (0,3):
   - (0,3) connects to (0,2) and (1,3).

7. From (0,3), moving to (1,3) which shifts us down a row:
   - (1,3) has connections back to (0,3), further right to (2,3), and within the same row to (1,2).

8. Next is (2,3):
   - (2,3) connects to up (1,3) and further down to (3,3).
   
9. Lastly, moving to (3,3):
   - (3,3) connects back to (2,3), with no more downward movement possible.

This path does not ignore any walls according to the adjacency list and progresses using adjacent cells only, as cross-referencing each move with the adjacency pairs shows it's valid. This solution also reaches the target (3,3) specified between <TARGET_START> and <TARGET_END>.
