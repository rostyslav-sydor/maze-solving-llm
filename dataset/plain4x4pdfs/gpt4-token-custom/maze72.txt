<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning behind the chosen path:

1. **Starting Point**: The maze begins at (0,0) as given by <ORIGIN_START>.

2. **Adjacency List Analysis**:
   - Initializing from (0,0), its adjacent cells in the adjacency list are (0,1).
   - From (0,1), we proceed to (0,2) as it is directly connected.
   - Continuing to (0,3) from (0,2), which further connects to (1,3).
   - The path from (1,3) leads directly to (2,3).
   - Finally, from (2,3) the endpoint (3,3) is accessible directly.

3. **Validation**:
   - Each step moves to a directly connected, or adjacent, cell, verifying that no walls are crossed by checking the adjacency list provided.
   - The route only uses connections explicitly stated, ensuring legitimacy according to the graph's connections.

This path uses the fewest steps and maintains direct adjacency throughout, ensuring an optimal and valid path through the maze from the given origin to the target.
