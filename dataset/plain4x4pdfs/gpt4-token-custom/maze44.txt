To solve the given maze problem expressed as an adjacency list, I will interpret the connections as direct available paths between the "cells" defined by coordinates. The goal is to determine a sequence of moves from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), following adjacent connections explicitly outlined in the adjacency list.

First, let's recap the adjacency list for clarity and easier reference:
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)

To find a path:
1. Start at the origin (0,0) and look for connected nodes: (0,0) is connected to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), the options are (2,0) and (1,1).
3. Taking (1,1), next available connections are (0,1), (2,1). 
   - Moving to (2,1) offers a route via (3,1).
4. From (3,1), next connected nodes are (3,0), (3,2), and (2,1). The connection to (3,2) seems promising.
5. From (3,2) it's connected to (3,1) and yet more importantly to (2,2).
6. From (2,2) the connections lead to (3,2), and (2,3).
7. From (2,3) proceed to (3,3), which is the target.

Path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

The proposed path uses valid, direct connections given in the adjacency list where each step between nodes only advances to an adjacent node directly connected in the list, ensuring no walls are crossed and the integrity of the maze is maintained.

Final path representation:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
