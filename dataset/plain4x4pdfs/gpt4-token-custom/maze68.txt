Let's start by analyzing the adjacency list provided for the maze. This list specifies all the connected points in the maze, and from here, we can plot a route from the origin to the target. The stated origin (entry point) is (0,0) and the target (exit point) is (3,3).

Using the adjacency list:
1. (2,3) <--> (1,3)
2. (1,0) <--> (1,1)
3. (3,1) <--> (3,2)
4. (3,2) <--> (3,3)
5. (3,3) <--> (2,3)
6. (1,3) <--> (0,3)
7. (2,1) <--> (3,1)
8. (0,1) <--> (0,2)
9. (2,0) <--> (3,0)
10. (0,1) <--> (1,1)
11. (0,0) <--> (1,0)
12. (2,1) <--> (1,1)
13. (2,2) <--> (2,1)
14. (2,0) <--> (2,1)
15. (1,0) <--> (2,0)
16. (1,3) <--> (1,2)
17. (0,2) <--> (0,3)
18. (2,2) <--> (1,2)

Starting at the origin (0,0), we can trace a path to the target (3,3) as follows:
- From (0,0) move to (1,0) (using adjacency 11).
- From (1,0) move to (1,1) (using adjacency 2).
- From (1,1) move to (2,1) (using adjacency 12).
- From (2,1) move to (2,2) (using adjacency 13).
- From (2,2) move to (1,2) (using adjacency 18).
- From (1,2) move to (1,3) (using adjacency 16).
- From (1,3) move to (2,3) (using adjacency 1).
- From (2,3) move to (3,3) (using adjacency 5).

Final Path:
- <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Verification:
- Each move in the solution path connects directly to the next via the adjacency list.
- The path does not cross any walls or veer off to non-adjacent cells.
- The path is kept simple and does not include any unnecessary detours or backtracks.
- The path starts at the origin (0,0) and successfully reaches the target (3,3).

This proposed path adheres to the constraints given, employs only the connections outlined in the adjacency list, and provides a direct route through the maze from entrance to exit.
