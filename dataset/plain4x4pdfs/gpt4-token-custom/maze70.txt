To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I'll use a search algorithm (BFS - Breadth-First Search) to traverse the graph from the specified origin to the target. Here's the step-by-step process and the deliberations based on the adjacency list provided:

1. **Representing the Maze:** Convert the adjacency list representation into a more usable format (e.g., using a dictionary where keys are cell coordinates and values are lists of adjacent cells).

2. **Starting Point:** The origin/start point of the maze is (0,0).

3. **Target Point:** The target/exit point of the maze is (3,3).

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm:**
   - Initialize a queue with the start point and a set to track visited nodes.
   - Enqueue the initial position (0,0) and mark it as visited.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first element. For each adjacent cell:
     - If it's not visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
     - Track the path from the start to the current cell using a predecessor map.
   - When you reach the target cell, backtrack using the predecessor map to construct the path from start to target.

5. **Construction of the Path:**
   - If BFS successfully finds (3,3), backtrack from (3,3) to (0,0) to reconstruct the path.

6. **Checking for Correct Path:**
   - Ensure the path does not cross walls by verifying that each consecutive pair of coordinates in the path corresponds to an adjacency in the list.
   - Ensure the use of only adjacent cells as dictated by the adjacency entries.

Considering these steps, we can analyze the relationships in the adjacency list, apply BFS, and verify with the list that the derived path uses valid moves. Now, for the given maze structure, following these steps yields:

Start at (0,0) and analyze possible routes. Following BFS using the adjacency list and marking visited nodes, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) through adjacent and connected paths is derived.

The verified path using adjacency checks:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each step in the path connects directly according to the adjacency list specification. This path also ensures no wall crossing and only moves to directly connected cells, respecting the maze's rules as defined by the adjacency list.
