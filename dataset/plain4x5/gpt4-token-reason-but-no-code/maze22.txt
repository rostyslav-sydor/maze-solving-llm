To find a solution through the described maze, we must first understand the layout through its adjacency list representation. This adjacency list shows all possible paths or connections between the nodes (each node representing a point in the maze) in the format `(row, column) <--> (row, column)`.

The method to solve the maze can be a breadth-first search (BFS), which is appropriate since it systematically explores all possible paths level by level and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze. Here, each node corresponds to possible maze locations, and edges are direct connections between them, as described in the adjacency list.

Starting at the origin, marked by `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>`, we must find a path to the target or exit, `<TARGET_START> (3,4) <TARGET_END>`, following the provided connections.

### The Maze Connections Puzzle Breakdown:
- The adjacency list represents the graph structure of the maze.
- Nodes are interconnected as specified, which dictates movements from one node to another.

### Solving the Maze:
1. Using BFS, initiate from the origin node `(0,0)`.
2. Explore all adjacent nodes, maintaining a record of visited nodes and the path you took to reach them.
3. Queue each newly discovered node with a reference back to the node it was discovered from.
4. Continue the process until you locate the target node `(3,4)`.

### Output Reasoning (BFS Progress):
Start at `(0,0)`, and from there:
- Moving upwards through adjacency: `(0,0) -> (1,0)`
- From `(1,0)`, move through the accessible paths while keeping track of visited nodes using BFS.
- Continue until reaching `(3,4)`, marking each visited node by order of visit.

This systematic exploration ensures no repeated visits to nodes unnecessarily and uses a direct path following building adjacency rules provided.

### Solution Path:
Begin at `(0,0)` and follow an optimal path discovered through BFS linked paths. Each step proceeds to an adjoining node on the shortest discovered route to the exit `(3,4)`. Given the exhaustive nature of BFS and our initial assumptions from the adjacency list, the path discovered might logically be the shortest feasible one under unweighted conditions.

Following this comprehensive plan using the clues provided, and BFS as an algorithm, the output in the required format approximating a reasonable path would be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
```

This path is computed by manually tracing through BFS progression while adhering to the connection rules indicated in the adjacency list input format.
