To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4). 

The adjacency list outlines the direct connections (or passages) between different coordinates (cells) in the maze. A path through the maze would be a series of connected coordinates that starts at the origin and ends at the target, following the connections specified.

1. **Start at the Origin (0,0)**: According to the adjacency list, from (0,0) there are passages to (1,0) and (0,1). 
   
2. **Assess Possible Routes**:
   - If we go to (0,1), we can only progress to (0,2).
   - From (0,2), we can go to (1,2), which seems promising because it is more centrally located within the grid.
   
3. **Progress Through Centrally Located Points**:
   - At (1,2), there is a connection to (1,3). The aim should be to move closer to the target by progressing downward or rightward when possible.
   - From (1,3) we see that (2,3) is directly connected.

4. **Move Vertically Towards the Target**:
   - At (2,3), moving to (2,4) progresses us closer to the goal since it is directly aligned vertically with the target.
   - Now at (2,4), we can move directly to (3,4), as they are connected.

Thus, following the sequence outlined above, the successfully traversed path from the origin to the target in the maze, using the available links, can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path effectively uses the adjacency connections in the prescribed maze, moving strategically towards the target while adhering to available passages.
