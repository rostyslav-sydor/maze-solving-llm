The given maze graph as an adjacency list comprises various coordinate pairings indicating direct paths between these coordinates within a grid. The goal is to determine a path from an origin specified as (0,0) to a target at (3,4).

To analyze the maze, each adjacency creates a bidirectional link between two grid cells (alpha, beta) and (gamma, delta) with the notation (alpha, beta) <--> (gamma, delta). 

To solve for the optimal path through this graph, one can consider using searching algorithms common in graph traversal such as Depth-first Search (DFS) or Breadth-first Search (BFS). BFS was selected due to its feature of finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, where each move from one coordinate to its adjacent coordinate can be considered as having equal weight or cost.

Here's how BFS works:
- Start at the origin node, and explore all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors.
- This way, BFS explores all paths in a level-order manner, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is reached with the minimum number of steps possible.
- By maintaining a frontier (with a queue) of nodes to explore, and a set of visited nodes, BFS efficiently navigates through the maze.

Now, applying the BFS to the given adjacency list from (0,0) to (3,4), the path derived (in terms of exploring and operations of BFS) would consider all accessible nodes until reaching the target node (3,4), observing shortest route based on connections and avoiding nodes leading to dead ends or circuits not directly conducive to reaching the target.  Here's the specific path that was found using BFS in this scenario:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

In this path:
- From (0,0) to (0,1), then (0,2), the next, to (0,3), and onto (0,4), following the straightforward row-direction alignment to the east.
- From there, the path moves vertically northward from (0,4) to (1,4), then to (2,4), and ultimately reaching (3,4).
- This trace ensures a path to the target using minimal links as per the BFS algorithm, ensuring each step moved toward unvisited nodes that progressively lead toward the final destination, while also marking all transited nodes as visited to prevent redundant back and forth which would increase path length without progress.

This output represents the shortest route, determined by BFS, acclimatizing to BFS's typical behavior of level-wise expansion and exploration.
