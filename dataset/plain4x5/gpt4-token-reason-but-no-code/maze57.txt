To solve the maze given by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4). A sensible approach would be to use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which systematically explores the vertices level by level and is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

We begin at the origin (0,0) and explore all adjacent nodes, progressively branching out while marking nodes as visited to prevent loops and backtracking. By tracing the path of nodes visited, from the entry to the exit, we can reconstruct the route once the exit node (3,4) is reached.

From the adjacency list, construct a map:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0) and connects back to (0,0)
- (2,0) connects to (3,0) and connects back to (1,0)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1) and connects back to (2,0)
- From (3,1) you can move to (3,2) or go back to (3,0)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3) and so forth until the path reaches (3,3) then (3,4).

Starting at the origin (0,0), follow the path using BFS:
- From (0,0) move to (1,0)
- From (1,0) proceed to (2,0)
- From (2,0) go to (3,0)
- Continue from (3,0) to (3,1)
- From (3,1) then go to (3,2)
- Head over from (3,2) to (3,3)
- From (3,3) the final connection leads to (3,4) which is the exit.

Hence, the solution for navigating the maze from the point (0,0) to (3,4) is the sequence of coordinates followed in this path.

The final output in the specified format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
