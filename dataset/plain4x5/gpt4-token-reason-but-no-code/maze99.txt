To solve the maze represented by the provided adjacency list, we need to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,4). The adjacency list gives specific connections between the maze cells as bidirectional path possibilities. 

From the origin, we initiate breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is an ideal choice here because it explores all possible movements from a node level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target, it has found the shortest path. Depth-first search (DFS), while useful in certain cases, might get trapped in loops without careful management, or may return a longer path, since it explores as far into each branch as possible before backtracking.

### Step-by-step reasoning using BFS:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Enqueue the starting point (0,0) with a path list containing this point.
   - Set of visited nodes to prevent revisiting nodes and getting trapped in a loop.

2. **Processing**:
   - Each node dequeued will include looking at the adjacent nodes (where it can travel according to the adjacency list).
   - For each adjacent, non-visited node, append the node to the current path and enqueue it.
   - If an adjacent node is the target (3,4), the path leading to this node is the solution.

3. **Tracing the Path**:
   - Using the adjacency details provided and BFS, start from (0,0) and trace the path to (3,4). 

### Execution of BFS:

1. Begin at (0,0) which connects to [(0,1)].
   - Enqueue [(0,1)].
2. (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)].
   - (0,0) is visited, so skip. Enqueue [(0,2)].
3. (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3)].
   - Skip the visited. Enqueue [(0,3)].
4. (0,3) connects to [(0,2), (0,4), (1,3)].
   - Skip the visited. Enqueue [(0,4), (1,3)].
5. (0,4) is dead-end except back to (0,3).
6. (1,3) connects to [(0,3), (1,4)].
   - Enqueue [(1,4)].
7. (1,4) connects to [(1,3), (2,4)].
   - Enqueue [(2,4)].
8. (2,4) connects to [(1,4), (3,4), (2,3)].
   - (3,4) is the target, end search.

### Solution Path

Following the correct BFS path tracked, we collect the shortest path coordinates from (0,0) to (3,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence bypasses paths that go back to previously visited cells and follows the shortest route to the exit according to BFS and the adjacency connections.
