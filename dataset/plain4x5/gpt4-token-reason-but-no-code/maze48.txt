To solve the maze described in this adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4). The adjacency list specifies all possible movements between connected nodes in the maze, which are represented by coordinates in a grid. Once we understand this list, we can trace possible paths from the start to the end using an appropriate pathfinding algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).

Using BFS is suitable here because it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one. Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS will explore neighbors and mark each visited vertex, continuing until it reaches the target (3,4).

According to the adjacency list, these are the valid moves:
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,4)
- (0,4) <--> (1,4)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (3,3) <--> (3,4)
- etc.

Starting from (0,0), we need to select the path that continuously moves through connected vertices toward (3,4). By analyzing these connections, here is the optimal route:

Path:
1. Start at (0,0) and move to (0,1).
2. Continue to (0,2).
3. Proceed to (0,3).
4. Move to (0,4).
5. Transition to (1,4).
6. Move next to (2,4).
7. Travel to (2,3).
8. Go to (3,3).
9. Finally, move to the target at (3,4).

This path effectively navigates through the maze from start to finish using the connections provided, while maintaining the shortest route based on BFS's properties.

Hence, the solution to the maze in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
