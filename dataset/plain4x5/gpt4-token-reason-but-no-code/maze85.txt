To solve the maze problem described using the adjacency list provided, I will find the shortest path from the start (0,0) to the end (3,4). The adjacency list represents connections between grid cells: "(a,b) <--> (c,d)" indicates that you can travel directly from cell (a,b) to cell (c,d) and vice versa.

The solution involves traversing the graph from the origin to the target, which can be efficiently performed using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is an appropriate approach for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path in cases where all edge weights are equal.

By applying BFS:

1. I will start from the origin (0,0) and explore all direct neighbors.
2. These exploration steps are extended to their neighbors until the target (3,4) is reached.

Considering the adjacency list provided, I'll construct the graph and apply BFS to determine the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,4).

Following BFS, the steps to reach (3,4) from (0,0) as per the given connections are recorded and provide the solution. Here is the specific path the algorithm has revealed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path showcases a step-by-step move through the cells directly from the starting point to the destination via connected routes, ensuring that the shortest route is taken according to the graph structure provided.
