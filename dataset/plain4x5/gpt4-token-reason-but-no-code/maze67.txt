To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4). A suitable method for this is to use a pathfinding algorithm such as the Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is good for unweighted graphs like this, where each edge is equally viable. BFS explores nodes level by level, which ensures the shortest path in an unweighted scenario.

Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS will explore all its direct neighbors, then the neighbors' neighbors, and so on, until it either finds the target or exhausts all connected nodes.

From the adjacency list, we translate it into a more exploitable format to visualize all the connections:
- From (0,0), we can reach (1,0).
- From (1,0), we can reach (0,0), (2,0).
- From (2,0), we can reach (1,0), (3,0), (2,1).
- From (3,0), we can reach (2,0).
- From (2,1), we can reach (2,0), (2,2), (3,1).
- From (3,1), we can reach (2,1), (3,2).
- From (3,2), we can reach (3,1), (3,3).
- From (3,3), we can reach (3,2), (3,4), (2,3).
- From (3,4), we can reach (3,3), (2,4).
- From (2,4), we can reach (3,4).
- From (2,3), we can reach (1,3), (3,3).

Exploiting BFS on this structure:

1. Starting at (0,0), we explore (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we explore (0,0) [already visited, thus ignored] and (2,0).
3. From (2,0), we explore new nodes (1,0) [visited], (3,0), and (2,1).
4. From (3,0), the only new node possible was (2,0) [visited].
5. From (2,1), we visit (2,0) [visited], (2,2), and (3,1).
6. From (2,2) and (3,1), we can then proceed to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), visit (3,3).
8. From (3,3), visit (3,4), which is the target.

Thus, the path followed by BFS correctly leads from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path is efficient and follows directly from the BFS algorithmâ€™s property of exploring the nearest unvisited nodes first, thereby ensuring that the first time it reaches the target is via the shortest possible route.
