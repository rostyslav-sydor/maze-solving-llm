To solve the maze, we start from the entry point (0,0) and aim to reach the exit point (3,4). By looking at the given adjacency list, we can construct the relationships and connectivity of each point in the maze.

**Analysis of Adjacency List:**
- `(0,0)` connects to `(0,1)`
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`
- `(1,1)` connects to `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(2,1)`
- `(1,0)` connects to `(1,1)` and `(2,0)`
- `(2,0)` connects to `(1,0)` and `(3,0)`
- `(3,0)` connects to `(2,0)` and `(3,1)`
- `(3,1)` connects to `(3,0)` and `(3,2)`
- `(3,2)` connects to `(3,1)` and `(3,3)`
- `(3,3)` connects to `(3,2)`, `(3,4)`, and `(2,3)`
- `(3,4)` connects to `(3,3)` and `(2,4)`
- `(2,4)` connects to `(3,4)`
- Moving from point `(2,3)` to `(3,3)`, then traveling through other connections reaches other coordinates.

**Steps to Solve the Maze:**
Starting from `(0,0)`, we follow the links as per the adjacency list:
1. Starting at `(0,0)`, the only move is to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, move to `(1,1)`.
3. From `(1,1)`, move to `(2,1)`.
4. From `(2,1)`, move to `(2,2)`.
5. From `(2,2)`, move to `(2,3)`.
6. From `(2,3)`, move to `(3,3)`.
7. From `(3,3)`, move to `(3,4)`, which is the exit.

Thus, the sequence of moves through the maze from the start `(0,0)` to the target `(3,4)` is a chain of reachable coordinates guided by the adjacency relationships.

**Final Path for the Maze:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

Each step above directly progresses to an adjacent coordinate that allows eventual arrival at the destination without any dead ends or loops, based on the provided adjacency connections.
