The maze is modeled as an adjacency list where each pair of vertices enclosed in brackets indicate a passage between the cells in a 2-dimensional grid. To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4), we must navigate through this grid following the valid connections specified in the adjacency list.

**Steps and Reasoning:**
1. **Graph Interpretation:** Translate the adjacency list into a more manageable graph structure, preferably an actual adjacency list where each coordinate key points to a list of directly connected neighbors.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Given the structure of the maze without any weighted edges, BFS is a natural choice. It explores all possible positions level by level based on the current node's neighbors, making it efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid maze. It also ensures that we explore all possible nodes from the origin before moving on to nodes that are further away.

3. **Path Recording:** During the BFS, keep track of the paths by recording the predecessor of each node visited. This will allow reconstruction of the path from the origin to the target once the target is found.

4. **Path Reconstruction:** Once the BFS reaches the target node, reconstruct the pathway from the origin to destination using the predecessor records from the last step.

**Implementation and Specific Solution Based on the Provided Maze Details:**
- Following the BFS exploration from the origin (0,0), the search would move progressively through accessible nodes as outlined by the adjacency list, visiting and queuing each node's neighbors until it reaches the target (3,4).

- Based on the grid's connectivity and the BFS exploration, an example of a path found could be linear: sequentially moving through connections that sequentially approach the target without backtracking or detour, due to the efficient nature of BFS in exploring level by level.

**Example of Traversed Path (not the only possible path):**
- Starting at the origin at (0,0)
- Head rightward to (0,1), then to (0,2)
- Continue the upward movement to (0,3) then rightward to (0,4)
- Move down to (1,4), and then further down to (2,4) 
- Transition directly to the destination (3,4)

**Final Path Output Format:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This route directly goes through each coordinate moving row-by-row and column-by-column, using the connections given in the adjacency list, and finally reaching the goal while ensuring every move is valid as per the grid's defined pathways.
