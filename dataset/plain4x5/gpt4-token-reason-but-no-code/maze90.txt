To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, I have to determine the path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,4) using the provided connections between coordinates.

Hereâ€™s my approach to finding the solution:
1. **Understanding the Graph Representation**: Each pair like (0,1) <--> (1,1) indicates that there's a direct connection between these two points in the maze.
2. **Graph Construction**: Construct a graph from the adjacency list, representing each point as a node and each connection as an edge.
3. **Pathfinding**: Apply a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Specific Maze Solution
Here is how I step through the maze:
- Start at (0,0), connect to (0,1). Continue to paths connected to (0,1) which is (1,1).
- From (1,1), paths lead to (1,0) and (1,2). Follow the link to (1,2) as it seems more centrally aligned vertically, maintaining more options.
- Connecting (1,2) leads to (0,2) and (2,2), better continue to (2,2) moving us closer to the target's row.
- (2,2) connects to (2,3), which connects to (1,3).
- Continue from (1,3) to (0,3) and then (0,4), which connects down to (1,4) and so on down the rows until (3,4).

Thus, the path I planned undertakes available links while aiming directionally towards the target, considering possible branches at each step.

### Solution Path
The path moves systematically from the upper-left corner of the grid to the lower-right, taking advantage of available passages as mapped in the adjacency list:
  
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>`

Each step builds logically on the last with the goal of reducing the distance to the endpoint by taking the shortest known linked path. Each chosen connection is both valid (exists in the adjacency list) and effective (closer to or directly reaching the target).
