Analyzing the adjacency list of the given maze, the task is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4). The adjacency list describes the nodes (coordinate points in the maze) and their connections (where one can move directly between points).

For this solution, a breadth-first search (BFS) approach is suitable as it explores all possible moves from a start point and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this maze, where each move from one coordinate to an adjacent coordinate has equal cost.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes and their neighbors can be interpreted, enabling us to mark movements. Starting from the origin (0,0), we can explore neighboring points and continue until reaching the target (3,4). Tracing back the path from the target node to the origin node using predecessors encountered during BFS will provide the solution sequence.

Given this, using the provided adjacency information and conducting BFS reveals:

Starting BFS at (0,0) and exploring its neighbors: moving to (1,0). From (1,0) the next opens to (1,1); from (1,1) to (1,2). This continues as per adjacency connection points provided until reaching target (3,4). Following is the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

Thus, this is the explicit solution following the BFS algorithm in accordance with the provided adjacency list. The resulting path connects the specified origin to the destination without deviating from available paths, ensuring traversal of the maze correctly considering the adjacency list's completeness and accuracy.
