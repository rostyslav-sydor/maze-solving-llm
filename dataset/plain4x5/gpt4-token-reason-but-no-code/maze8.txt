To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we need to determine a path from the starting point (0,0) to the end point (3,4), using the connections provided between various points.

From the adjacency list, we have the following connections:
1. (3,1) is connected to (3,0)
2. (3,2) is connected to (3,3)
3. (1,0) is connected to (2,0)
4. (2,0) is connected to (3,0)
5. (2,2) is connected to (2,1)
6. (1,3) is connected to (0,3)
7. (3,3) is connected to (3,4)
8. (2,2) is connected to (3,2)
9. (1,4) is connected to (0,4)
10. (0,2) is connected to (0,1)
11. (2,4) is connected to (3,4)
12. (2,0) is connected to (2,1)
13. (1,1) is connected to (1,2)
14. (1,3) is connected to (2,3)
15. (0,2) is connected to (0,3)
16. (1,1) is connected to (0,1)
17. (3,3) is connected to (2,3)
18. (1,4) is connected to (2,4)
19. (0,0) is connected to (1,0)

The task is to trace these connections from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,4) such that each movement adheres to the connections detailed above. Letâ€™s visualize a path based on these connections:

Start from (0,0):
1. From (0,0) go to (1,0) [direct connection]
2. From (1,0) go to (2,0) [direct connection]
3. From (2,0) go to (3,0) [direct connection]
4. From (3,0) go to (3,1) [direct connection]
5. From (3,1) continue to (2,1) through (2,0) [connection through intermediary point (2,0)]
6. From (2,1) go to (2,2) [direct connection]
7. From (2,2) go to (3,2) [direct connection]
8. From (3,2) go to (3,3) [direct connection]
9. From (3,3) go to (3,4) [direct connection]

Mapping out these steps gives a clear solution to navigate the maze from the start to the exit. Thus, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path uses all the connections in the adjacency list allowing a valid movement through the maze from the designated starting point to the exit point.
