To solve the maze described, we start by laying out its construction through the provided adjacency list. The adjacency list shows pairs of coordinates connected directly by a path, enabling movement between these pairs.

The maze's entry point is denoted at coordinate (0,0), and the exit is located at (3,4). We aim to find a walkable path from entry to exit.

From the adjacency list, we build a graph:
- The edges between nodes show direct paths available between coordinates (e.g., (0,0) <--> (0,1)).
- The nodes represent the coordinates.

To solve this maze, an appropriate graph traversal algorithm, like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), can be applied. These algorithms help in identifying the path from the origin to the destination by navigating through connected nodes. BFS is particularly useful in this context as it explores the shortest path first through level-order traversal, making it efficient for this kind of task.

Given the structure of this maze:
- We launch BFS from the start coordinate (0,0).
- We explore all directly reachable coordinates, indicated by the adjacency list, range-checking to prevent revisiting.
- Once we reach the desired end coordinate (3,4), we capture the path taken to reach this point.

Proceeding with the BFS mechanism on this graph, following the edges laid out in the adjacency list, we aim to find a complete path from (0,0) to (3,4).

Now, looking at the adjacency list and constructing the path through simulated scale BFS, the optimal path found from the origin to the destination is:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4).

Thus, the solution to this maze in the required format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This provides a continuous path from the origin to the target following valid passages through the maze as described in the adjacency list.
