To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we first need to conceptualize the maze as a grid based on the given coordinates and edge relationships. The maze's entry point (origin) is at (0,0) and the exit point (target) is at (3,4).

The adjacency list indicates which nodes (coordinates) in the maze are directly connected, representing paths where one can move from one coordinate to neighboring coordinates. For instance, "(0,2) <--> (0,1)" means that one can move directly between coordinates (0,2) and (0,1).

Given the starting point (0,0) and the endpoint (3,4), the task is to find a path through the maze from start to end. This problem can be approached via graph traversal techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). The BFS is particularly suited for shortest path discovery in unweighted graphs, which fits the nature of our problem because every move from one node to its neighboring node can be considered as having the same weight or cost.

Using BFS:
1. We start at the entry point (0,0).
2. We explore each neighboring node connected to (0,0) by following the adjacency list.
3. We mark each visited node to avoid cycles and use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore.
4. We proceed until we find the exit point (3,4) or exhaust all possible paths.

Following this strategy and analyzing the adjacency data, the path discovered (given the connections) from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4) involves stepping through coordinates that directly connect from the start to the end without dead ends based on provided connections:

1. From (0,0), move to (1,0) [Using connection "(1,0) <--> (0,0)"].
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0) [Using connection "(1,0) <--> (2,0)"].
3. From (2,0), continue to (3,0) [Using connection "(3,0) <--> (2,0)"].
4. From (3,0), move upwards to (3,1) [Using connection "(3,1) <--> (3,0)"].
5. Continue from (3,1) to (3,2) [Using connection "(3,2) <--> (3,1)"].
6. From (3,2), move to (3,3) [Using connection "(3,3) <--> (3,2)"].
7. Finally, from (3,3), move to (3,4) [Using connection "(2,4) <--> (3,4)"].

With every move going from a coordinate to a directly connected neighboring coordinate, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents a valid path through the maze from the entry to the exit point, adhering to the connectivity rules defined in the adjacency list.
