To solve the maze presented via the adjacency list, we first have to understand the mapping between nodes given in the list. The maze is essentially a collection of cells (coordinates) which are connected to certain adjacent cells, indicating pathways. The goal is to navigate from the defined origin to the target (exit).

Given the origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,4), we need to find a series of moves that connect these two points using only the connections provided. A typical way is to think of this as a graph where each connection (an edge) allows movement between directly linked nodes (vertices).

To do this, we create a representation of the graph from the adjacency list provided and identify the shortest or a valid path between the source and target nodes using a search algorithm. The search could be a breadth-first search (BFS) which is ideal for unweighted graphs like this, as it ensures the shortest path is found.

I will simulate the process of BFS which ensures a layer-wise exploration of nodes, moving outward from the source and marking each node's predecessor. Once the target node is reached, the path is reconstructed from the target to the source using these predecessors.

From the adjacency list, we construct a graph and proceed with BFS:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all directly connected nodes; from (0,0) the next possible step is to (1,0).
3. Continue outward: from (1,0) we can go to (2,0), and from there to (3,0).
4. From (3,0), the path can progress to (3,1), then to (3,2), and further to (3,3).
5. Lastly, move from (3,3) to (3,4) which is the target.
   
This forms a path, ensuring each move is valid based on the graph structure derived from the adjacency list. Let's compile the path notation:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path directly reflects a valid solution to navigate the maze from the entry point to the exit, following the allowable paths given in the adjacency list. The method ensures the path is correct, considering BFS explores each shortest route from the origin before moving to further distances, ensuring the effectiveness in a maze-solving context.
