Given the adjacency list of the maze and the origin and target specified, the task involves determining a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4). This is essentially finding a path in a graph, where nodes represent positions in the maze and edges represent possible paths between these positions.

Starting from position (0,0), every adjacent position is explored until the target (3,4) is found. This process can be systematically managed using Breadth-First Search (BFS), a common graph traversal method that explores neighbors level by level; it checks all nodes at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that as soon as we reach the target node, it will be by the shortest path (in terms of number of moves).

Let's utilize the adjacency information:
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (0,1) connects to (0,2), (1,1), and back to (0,0)
- Following the paths in BFS manner, paths are extended checking each previously unvisited node that can be reached based on the adjacency list.

The process continues by progressing to each connected node, checking if it's the target, and if not, adding its unvisited neighbors to the list of nodes to explore next. This would be continued until the target node (3,4) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted (not the case here since a solution exists).

During the BFS, once (3,4) is discovered, we backtrack from there to the source (0,0) to record the complete path.

Applied to this maze:
1. From (0,0) to (0,1)
2. From (0,1) to (0,2)
3. From (0,2) to (0,3)
4. From (0,3) to (0,4)
5. From (0,4) to (1,4)
6. From (1,4) to (2,4)
7. From (2,4) to (2,3)
8. From (2,3) to (3,3)
9. From (3,3) to (3,4)

This path can be traced based on connections given in the adjacency list and reaches the target position. Thus, the formatted solution for the given maze from (0,0) to (3,4) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
