To solve the maze presented above, it's necessary to interpret it as a graph with coordinate-named nodes connected by edges. Each of these edges represents a direct, bidirectional path between two points in a grid layout. Given the adjacency list, it's possible to derive that the grid size is 4x5 based on the maximum indices mentioned in the coordinates.

The entry point into this maze is at (0,0) and the exit is at (3,4). The aim is to find a route through the maze's graph from the starting point to the ending point, visiting connected nodes as denoted by the adjacency relations.

For this problem, breadth-first search (BFS) is a suitable method. This algorithm works well for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one, where each move from one node to an adjacent node has the same cost or distance. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, naturally progressing through the maze from the start to the endpoint.

Implementing the BFS based on the provided adjacency list, it involves:
1. Starting from the entry node, (0,0).
2. Exploring all connected nodes and marking them as visited while keeping track of the path taken to reach each node.
3. Repeating until the exit node, (3,4), is reached or all possible paths are explored.

From manual mapping or systematic application of BFS to the adjacency list, the solution path following the shortest route available can be drafted as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This traverses the maze from the beginning (0,0) towards the right and downward, making use of the network's connectivity as per the adjacency listing. It represents an optimal path considering the bi-directionality and connectivity of nodes as specified.
