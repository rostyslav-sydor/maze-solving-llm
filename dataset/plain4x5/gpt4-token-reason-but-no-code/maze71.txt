To solve the maze, we translate the adjacency list provided into a graph where each node represents a cell in the maze, and the edges indicate which cells are connected (i.e., where it's possible to move directly from one cell to another). 

The task is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4). This can efficiently be tackled using search algorithms meant for graphs, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS is particularly suited for this purpose because it explores the nearest nodes first and guarantees a shortest path solution, finding the first available route from the start to the exit.

Let's go through the process systematically:

1. Represent the maze from the adjacency list into a graph representation.
2. Use BFS starting from the origin node (0,0). During this process:
   - Mark each visited node
   - Store the path to reach every node using a queue
   - For each node, explore the adjacent nodes (connected cells)
   - Stop the search when reaching the target node (3,4).
3. Extract and record the path from the origin to the destination as BFS guarantees the shortest path due to its level-wise exploration.

By following the BFS methodology, here is the solved path from (0,0) to (3,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

Reasoning behind choosing this path:
- Starting at (0,0), moving in primarily right (east) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) ensures covering the minimal lateral spread of the grid quickly.
- Advancing downwards from (0,3) to (1,3) then to (2,3) transitions across the vertical mid-section, making use of available north-south connections.
- Finally, moving from (2,3) to (3,3) and on to (3,4) completes the path by entering the last row and reaching the target.

This solution ensures that the path taken is direct and uses the connectivity given in the adjacency list with both optimal distance and traversal simplicity in mind.
