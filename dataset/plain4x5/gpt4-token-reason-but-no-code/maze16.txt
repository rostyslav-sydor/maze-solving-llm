The presented maze is described as an adjacency list, meaning every pair describes a pathway directly connecting two points (or cells) in a two-dimensional grid. The problem specifies entry and exit points: the maze starts at (0,0) and the goal is at (3,4).

To solve this maze, we need to interpret the adjacency list into a representation that could be traversed to find a possible path from the start point to the end point. In this particular case, a breadth-first search (BFS) would be effective, given that we are attempting to find the shortest path going from one node to another in an unweighted grid.

Starting from (0,0):
1. Explore all connected nodes and queue them.
2. Mark each visited node to prevent revisiting and cycling back.
3. Move onto the next nodes in the queue, exploring their connections until the target node (3,4) is reached or all possibilities are checked.

The paths recorded in the adjacency list provide exactly which cells are directly connected. Therefore, starting at (0,0), we'd check connections given by the list:
- From (0,0), move to (0,1), also connected to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can move either back to (0,1) or to (0,3), which leads to (0,4).
- From (0,4), we can then proceed to (1,4).
- From (1,4), stay on the fourth column moving from (1,4) to (3,4).

Thus, assembling the path from the connections derived from the list and marked by BFS approach results in:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents the shortest way guided by the BFS search on the adjacency list's connections from the starting point, (0,0), to the goal, (3,4), also ensuring all moves are valid as per provided connections.
