To solve the given maze using its adjacency list, we need to translate the list into a usable form, a graph, where each node represents a point in the maze, and each edge is a possible path between these points. The task involves finding a valid path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4) using this graph representation.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Every pair within "<ADJLIST_START> <ADJLIST_END>" describes connections between two points.
- "<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>" identifies the starting point of the maze.
- "<TARGET_START> (3,4) <TARGET_END>" marks the goal or exit of the maze.

Using the adjacency list, we can outline the potential routes from (0,0) to (3,4). We shall find a path using the understanding that each connection allows movement from one point to its neighbor, and backtracking where needed.

The specific connections give us maneuvering options through the grid. To navigate from the start to the finish:
1. Start at (0,0) – identified as the origin.
2. The adjacency between (0,0) and (0,1) is given.
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2), following its connection.
4. Continue from (0,2) to (0,3) – marking progression.
5. Progress from (0,3) to (0,4) as they are connected.
6. The adjacency between (0,4) to (1,4) is listed, continue there.
7. Progress from (1,4) to (2,4), following the given connection.
8. Finally, move from (2,4) to the final target (3,4).

Tracing back the pathway descriptions and move orders provided in the adjacency data, we create a series of moves from the origin to the target without ambiguity or redundancy.

With these deductions, the solution path through the maze, formatted according to the instructions, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This solution logically follows the connectivity rules and the prescribed path through the maze as per the adjacency list mentioned, offering a direct and clear route from the beginning to the end of the maze.
