To solve the maze mentioned, an adjacency list format has been provided, representing the connections between the corridors or sections in the maze. The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,4), as indicated.

From the adjacency list, the connections or passable corridors between nodes (coordinates) can be visualized. This allows us to construct a path from the entry point to the exit point by following reachable connections. A strategic approach like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be employed, but here we'll essentially trace a logical route from the entry to the exit using the given adjacency relationships.

Analyzing the provided paths between corridors:
- From (0,0) you can access (0,1).
- From (0,1) you can move to its connected coordinates (0,2).
- Continue from (0,2) to (1,2).
- Proceed from (1,2) to (1,3).
- Then from (1,3) go on to (1,4).
- Move from (1,4) to (0,4).
- From (0,4) you can reach the neighbor (3,4) by going through (3,3) using the path (0,4) --> (1,4) --> (2,4) --> (3,4).

Tracking through this succession of edges starting from the origin to the target using the adjacency relationships gives a possible solution path through the maze. Here's the formatted solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path efficiently uses the provided connections to navigate from the maze's entry to the exit point.
