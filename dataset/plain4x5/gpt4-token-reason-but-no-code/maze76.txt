To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we need to determine a path from the designated origin to the target while navigating through the connections provided.

**Problem Analysis:**
The origin of the maze is (0,0) and the target is (3,4). The connections within the adjacency list define possible movements from one cell to another. Hence, the problem is about finding a path from the origin to the target using these connections.

**Path Finding Approach:**
A common approach to finding paths in graphs (which this adjacency list essentially defines) is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS). This method systematically explores the graph's nodes, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted scenario like ours.

Using BFS involves:
1. Starting at the origin and exploring all directly reachable nodes.
2. Marking these nodes as visited and recording the path taken to reach them.
3. Repeating this while the queue of nodes is not empty.
4. Once the target is reached, backtracking the recorded paths to give the route taken.

**Applying BFS to the Maze:**
1. **Initialization:** Begin from the origin (0,0).
2. **Exploration:** Use the adjacency data to find which nodes can be visited next from the current node.
3. **Visit and Record:** For every node visited, record the node it was visited from. This forms a path mapping.
4. **Queue Management:** Use a queue to manage nodes that need to be explored next.
5. **Repeat:** Continue until you reach the target node, or the queue is exhausted (which theoretically should not happen in a maze with a valid solution).
6. **Path Reconstruction:** Once the target is reached, backtrack using the path mappings to construct the path from origin to target.

**Specific Maze Solution:**
For the given maze:
- Starting from (0,0)
- Using the described BFS strategy, here is the solution path:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
```

**Reasoning:**
- From (0,0), move down the rows to (1,0) then to (2,0) and then to (3,0) -- navigating through straight connections.
- Move through connected coordinates (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), arriving finally at (3,4), which is the target.
- Throughout the path, all moves are connected direct neighbors as per the adjacency list, bypassing the need to traverse more distant connections unnecessarily, thus providing the optimal path in the context of this maze arrangement.
