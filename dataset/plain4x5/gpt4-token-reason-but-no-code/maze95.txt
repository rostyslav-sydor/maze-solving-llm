To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, I will employ a common graph traversal algorithm called breadth-first search (BFS), which is particularly effective for finding the shortest path in a graph where all edges have the same weight, as is the case with adjacent points in a maze.

**Rationale:**
- BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the shortest route from the starting node (origin) to any given node is known as soon as that node is reached during the traversal.
- By using BFS, I'll systematically explore adjacent cells starting from the entry point of the maze, expanding outwards until the exit point is located.
  
**Steps:**
1. Parse the adjacency list to construct a graph in which each cell in the maze corresponds to a node and each connection between cells corresponds to an edge.
2. Utilize BFS to traverse the maze:
   - Start from the entry cell, (0,0).
   - Queue up each reachable neighboring cell and mark it as visited to avoid revisiting.
   - Continue expanding to other reachable cells, recording the parent of each cell to enable backtracking of the solution path once the exit, (3,4), is found.
3. Once the exit is reached, backtrack from the exit cell to the starting cell to determine the path taken.

**Building the Graph:**
We extract edges from the adjacency list, representing each connection `X <--> Y` by two directed connectivities `X -> Y` and `Y -> X` in a dictionary.

**Breadth-first Search Application:**
Starting BFS with the queue initialized to `[(0,0)]` (origin), expand to connected, unvisited cells. Continue until `(3,4)` (exit) is dequeued, indicating the end of the path.

**Backtracking for Path Extraction:**
Once the exit has been reached, backtrack using a parent recording mechanism set during BFS to reconstruct the path traveled from origin to destination.

**Solving This Specific Maze:**
Starting at `(0,0)`, navigate the maze using BFS until `(3,4)` is reached. Upon reaching, backtrack the visited nodes from exit to origin to identify the sequence of moves which corresponds to the shortest route through the maze.

**Output Path for the Provided Maze:**
Given the BFS and path reconstruction approach, the result for the specific pathway, starting at `(0,0)` and reaching `(3,4)`, will be output in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This result assumes optimal and correct parsing of the adjacency list and accurate implementation of BFS and the backtracking methodology. The aforementioned path is the shortest path, traversing through the essential points to efficiently exit the maze.
