To solve the maze provided, we need to translate the adjacency list into a graph representation, such as using nodes as vertices and edges as connections. We can then apply a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point (origin) to the exit point (target).

The adjacency list given represents the connectivity between different coordinates in the maze, showing which coordinates are directly reachable from each other. We can parse this list to form edges in our graph. The BFS algorithm will work efficiently here because it explores all possible paths level by level and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze.

The BFS process involves:
1. Starting at the origin (0,0), visiting and marking it as discovered.
2. Exploring all its direct neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on.
3. Using a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored and a predecessor link list (or map) to reconstruct the path once we reach the target.
4. Continuing the exploration until we find the target (3,4) or exhaust all possibilities.

Upon successfully finding the target, we backtrack using our predecessor links from the target node to the origin node to construct the path.

Let's utilize the BFS approach based on the adjacency information given:

- Start at the origin (0,0) which only connects to (1,0).
- Explore from (1,0) to its connections, which are (2,0) and (0,0). (0,0) is originating so we skip backtracking.
- Continuing from (2,0) to (3,0), and then from (3,0) to (3,1).
- Then from (3,1) to its connections, which include moving toward (3,0) already visited, and (3,2) not yet visited.
- Continuing to (3,2) to (3,3), then from (3,3) to the target (3,4).

Here's the solution path reconstructed from this BFS exploration:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path provides a possible shortest route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4) as we have traversed the graph correctly according to the connections listed in the adjacency description. Each step follows directly accessible paths from one coordinate to its adjacent coordinate until the destination is reached.
