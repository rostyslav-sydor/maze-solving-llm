The maze specified by the adjacency list describes a connectivity graph where each cell `(x, y)` is linked to another. To solve the maze, we want to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,4)` respecting these connections. 

For example, in the given list, the connection `(2,1) <--> (2,2)` means from cell `(2,1)` we can move to `(2,2)` and vice versa.

To establish the solution:
1. We recognize connections as bidirectional between the coordinates.
2. Starting from `(0,0)`, we follow connections that allow the movement towards the target coordinate `(3,4)`.
3. We avoid backtracking to cells already visited to prevent loops, optimizing our path search.
4. We inspect the adjacency list to determine feasible paths and adopt a systematic approach like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list and mapping available moves:
- We start from `(0,0)` and can move directly to `(0,1)`. 
- From `(0,1)`, there is access to `(0,2)`. 
- `(0,2)` is connected further to `(1,2)`, then `(1,3)`.
- From `(1,3)` to `(1,4)` and subsequently to `(2,4)`.
- Finally, `(2,4)` connects to `(3,4)` which is the target exit cell of the maze.

Each step progresses towards the goal without revisiting any cell, ensuring the path's efficiency. Now, following this logical sequence, we can construct the output with the path from the origin to the target.

Thus the solution to the maze provided in the specified format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This path is derived by logically linking direct connections from the origin to the target as enumerated. The solution satisfies the constraints set by the adjacency list in a minimal step manner, representing an efficient pass through the maze.
