The maze is provided as an adjacency list of graph coordinates, indicating passages between points in the maze. We need to identify the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the end point (3,4).

To solve this problem, I applied a breadth-first search (BFS) approach since BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a graph, especially in an unweighted graph like this one where all moves have equal cost. BFS explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, and typically also utilizes a set or another structure to track which nodes have been visited.

After setting up the BFS algorithm with the provided adjacency listing as the graph structure, we start from the origin (0,0). The BFS follows through exploring each neighboring coordinate that can be reached from the current position. This process continues until either all possible paths are exhausted (i.e., the queue is empty), or the target coordinate (3,4) is reached.

For the given adjacency list after applying a BFS algorithm, we trace back from the exit point (3,4) via the visited nodes that lead back to the entry point (0,0), ensuring the path traced is the shortest one possible given the structure of the graph.

Simulating this through the BFS approach gives the following shortest path in the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through corridors linking these coordinates in the least steps, without any unnecessary diversions, ensuring a minimal path from (0,0) to (3,4). This direct pathfinding result leverages the sequential nature and expansiveness of BFS in exploring every possible avenue until the most direct route to the target is confirmed.
