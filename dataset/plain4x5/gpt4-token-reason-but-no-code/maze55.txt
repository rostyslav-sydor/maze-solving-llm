To solve this maze problem, we first interpret the representation given in the adjacency list format, mapping nodes (coordinates) to their directly accessible neighboring nodes. From these mappings, we determine possible paths from the origin (start point) to the target (end point) using a pathfinding algorithm. A common choice is Dijkstra's or Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to the uniform weight of edges (each move from one position to a neighboring position is essentially of equal 'cost' or 'distance').

Let's break down the adjacency list:
- (0,0) -> (1,0), (0,1)
- (0,1) -> (0,0)
- (0,2) -> (1,2), (0,3)
- (0,3) -> (0,2), (0,4), (1,3)
- (0,4) -> (0,3), (1,4)
- (1,0) -> (0,0), (1,1)
- (1,1) -> (1,2), (1,0)
- (1,2) -> (1,1), (0,2), (2,2)
- (1,3) -> (1,4), (2,3), (0,3)
- (1,4) -> (0,4), (1,3)
- (2,0) -> (2,1)
- (2,1) -> (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)
- (2,2) -> (1,2), (2,1)
- (2,3) -> (2,4), (1,3)
- (2,4) -> (2,3), (3,4)
- (3,0) -> (3,1)
- (3,1) -> (2,1), (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,2) -> (3,1), (3,3)
- (3,3) -> (3,2), (3,4)
- (3,4) -> (2,4), (3,3)

Given that our entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,4), we shall use BFS for its simplicity and ability to handle unweighted graphs effectively. Starting from (0,0), we explore all possible paths breadth-first until we find the target. Each coordinate will track its predecessor to reconstruct the path upon reaching the target.

After analyzing potential paths in the maze, we discover that a successful route from (0,0) to (3,4) can route through the points shown in a constructive and non-repeating way:
(0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) to (0,4) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (3,4).

Transforming these navigating steps into the response in your requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This path sensibly reaches the desired target using a feasible and direct route according to the graph connections provided.
