The problem provided is a maze traversal problem, where we need to find a path from an entry point (origin) to an exit point (target) using the maze's representation through an adjacency list of coordinates (nodes in graph terms).

To solve this:
1. **Identify the Graph Structure**: Translate the adjacency list into a graph. Each pair of coordinates in the list represents a bidirectional edge between two nodes (positions in the maze).

2. **Graph Traversal Algorithm**: Choose an appropriate graph traversal algorithm to find a path from origin to target. Depth-first search (DFS) or Breadth-first search (BFS) are common choices for such tasks. For simplicity and efficiency in finding the shortest path, BFS is preferred.

3. **Implement the Traversal**: Start at the origin and explore all neighboring nodes following the graph's edges, continuing until the target node is reached or all possible paths are exhausted. Keep a record of the path followed.

4. **Output the Path**: Once the target is found, backtrack from the target to the origin using the recorded paths to reconstruct the route taken.

Given the adjacency information:
- The maze consists of multiple coordinate pairs showing direct connections (edges).
- The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,4).

Using BFS in this situation, starting from (0,0), we would explore in layers outward, checking each directly connected node, marking each visited node to prevent cycles, and tracking the sequence to ensure a correct path can be reconstructed.

**Calculated Path:**
Starting from (0,0):
- Move right to (0,1) as per the link (0,1) <--> (0,0).
- Continue right to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2).
- Move up to (1,2) through (1,2) <--> (0,2).
- Move to (1,3) by the link (1,3) <--> (1,2).
- Progress to (1,4) using (1,4) <--> (1,3).
- Move left to (0,4) from (1,4) <--> (0,4).
- Navigate to (0,3) using (0,4) <--> (0,3).
- Now proceed to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (0,3).
- Move left to (2,2) owing to (2,3) <--> (2,2).
- Go down to (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (2,2).
- Keep moving to (3,1) as per (3,1) <--> (3,2).
- Then straight to (3,3) using (3,3) <--> (3,2).
- Finally reach (3,4) from (3,3) <--> (3,4).

The path computation systematically uses available links to step towards the goal ensuring shortest path, due to BFS's layer-wise expansion.

**Output Format:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (0,4) (0,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
