The problem presents a maze where cells are connected in certain patterns shown in the adjacency list. Our goal is to find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,4)`.

The adjacency list specifies which cells are directly connected to each other in the maze. To determine a path from the origin to the target, consider how these connections allow movement between the points.

### Analyzing the adjacency list
From our starting point `(0,0)`, the list shows:
- `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
- `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`

This indicates from `(0,0)`, you can move to `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`. Normally, any pathfinding approach like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) could be suited here. However, to avoid complex computation and code, we can manually trace connective paths that reach closer to our end point `(3,4)`.

### Manually tracking the potential path:
1. Starting at `(0,0)`, move to `(1,0)` - as per linked adjacency `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
2. From `(1,0)`, `move to `(1,1)` - adjacency shows `(1,1) <--> (1,0)`
3. From `(1,1)`, move to `(2,1)` - adjacency shows `(1,1) <--> (2,1)`
4. From `(2,1)`, move to `(3,1)` - adjacency shows `(3,1) <--> (2,1)`
5. From `(3,1)`, move to `(3,2)` - adjacency shows `(3,1) <--> (3,2)`
6. From `(3,2)`, move to `(3,3)` - adjacency shows `(3,3) <--> (3,2)`
7. From `(3,3)`, move to `(3,4)` - adjacency shows `(3,4) <--> (3,3)`

Each of these moves is checked to ensure an existing link in the adjacency list. This pathway successfully moves from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,4)` without any detours, directly satisfying the maze's route.

### Solution Path
The solution to the maze, tracing valid connections specified in the adjacency list, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This series optimally represents a feasible path from the entry to the exit of the maze according to the given adjacency connections.
