To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list format, we first interpret the list to create a graph where each node represents a coordinate point in the maze and each edge signifies a direct passage between two points. From the provided adjacency list, the connections between the points in the maze are clearly defined.

The start point (origin) of the maze is (0,0) and the end point (target) is (3,4), as specified between the <ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END> tags.

Given this, the approach involves finding a path from the starting point to the ending point using the given maze structure. A suitable method here is a breadth-first search (BFS), which efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze. BFS expands nodes level-by-level, ensuring that once it reaches the target node, the path found is indeed the shortest.

**Process Overview:**
1. **Initialize:** Start BFS from (0,0), using a queue initialized with this node and a map to track paths.
2. **Explore:** Systematically explore adjacent nodes, marking each visited node and recording the path taken to each. If the route reaches the target node (3,4), BFS ensures this path is the shortest.
3. **Result:** When the target node is dequeued, retrieve and output the path from the start to the target.

Following this approach with the given maze:

Starting from (0,0), paths can be explored through connections like:
- From (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0).
- Continuing from each, expand to new nodes reachable directly through the graph connections.
- This expansion continues in layers, evaluating connections like (0,1) to (0,2) or (1,0) to subsequent reachable nodes.

Upon implementing this, we find a sequence of coordinates forming a path from (0,0) to (3,4), which adheres to all adjacency rules given.

**Specific Solution Path Found:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path correctly follows available corridors (edges) from the starting to ending points, using one of the possible routes derived from the graph structure presented. The solution ensures the path uses valid connections between points as specified in the provided adjacency notation.
