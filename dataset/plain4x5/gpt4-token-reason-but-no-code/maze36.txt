To solve the maze, we must traverse the graph from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4), checking connections between points and ensuring the path is direct and without backtracking to already visited points.

Reviewing the adjacency list:

1. (0,0) connects to (1,0)
2. (1,0) connects to (1,1)
3. (1,1) connects to (0,1); (0,1) connects to (0,2)
4. (0,2) connects to (1,2)
5. (1,2) connects to (2,2)
6. (2,2) connects to (3,2)
7. (3,2) connects to (3,1); (3,1) connects to (3,0)
8. After reaching the end of this route, return back up to (3,2)
9. (3,2) connects to (3,3)
10. (3,3) connects to (3,4), which is the target.

This route has been selected because it follows the graph's connections starting from the origin and systematically moves towards the target, ensuring that at each step, the movement is allowed by the adjacency list.

Thus, the path sequence through the maze from (0,0) to (3,4) using the available connections looks like this:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
