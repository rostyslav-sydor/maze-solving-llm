To solve this maze, we need to map the adjacency list into a graph format and then apply a search algorithm to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4). Given the adjacency list provides direct connectivity between points, we can treat this problem as finding a path in an unweighted graph.

Using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) would be suitable here because it explores all neighboring vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This characteristic is useful in mazes or grid-related problems as it guarantees the shortest path is found if one exists. 

Analyzing the adjacency list:
- Nodes like (0,0) connect to (0,1) and so forth, showing the structure of the grid.
- We identify the starting point (0,0) and the target (3,4) based on the provided tokens.

Applying BFS:
1. Initialize the BFS from the starting node (0,0), marking it as visited.
2. Explore all its directly connected neighbors, then each of those node's neighbors, and continue this expansion.
3. As we proceed, track each node's predecessor, enabling us to reconstruct the path once we reach the exit node.
4. Upon reaching (3,4), we backtrack using the recorded predecessors to list the path from start to finish.

Upon executing BFS with the connections defined by the adjacency list, we find the path from node (0,0) to (3,4) considering all possible connections and avoiding any cycles due to repeated nodes.

Each connection and step is crucial, and the reasoning for each move is endorsed by the BFS exploration order guaranteeing that the earliest moment a node can be reached is recorded, resulting in the optimal path discovery.

Based on the adjacency list given and applying the BFS approach as described, the sequence of nodes forming the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,4) in the maze is computed and presented:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path is the shortest way from the start to the target within the provided maze structure.
