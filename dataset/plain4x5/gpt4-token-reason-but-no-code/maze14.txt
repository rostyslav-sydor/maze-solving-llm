The task at hand involves navigating a maze which is provided using an adjacency list format. The goal is to move from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,4) by following the defined paths between coordinates.

Based on the adjacency list given:
- We start at the point (0,0).
- From each coordinate, you can travel to any directly connected coordinate as per the adjacency connections.

To find the shortest path from the start to the target, we can employ a breadth-first search (BFS) method. BFS is particularly well-suited for unweighted graphs, like our maze grid, because it explores the closest nodes first, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path. Each node is visited once and the paths are explored in layers.

For the given maze:
1. Start BFS from point (0,0). 
2. Enqueue the starting point and proceed to explore all directly connected points (neighbors).
3. For each point, check all its neighbors and enqueue them if they haven't been visited.
4. Continue the process until the target point (3,4) is reached.

Following the BFS traversal from the given adjacency list (while keeping track of the predecessors), we'd find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,4). Based on the connections:

1. Starting from (0,0) move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) move to (1,4).
6. From (1,4), move to (2,4).
7. Finally, from (2,4) move to (3,4).

This path sequence can be reasoned as optimal given that BFS ensures the shortest path and the graph does not have any weights complicating the path lengths. Let's appropriately format it as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>
