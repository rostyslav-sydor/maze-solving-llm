To find a solution for the given maze represented by an adjacency list, a path needs to be determined from the specified entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4).

#### Breakdown of Solution:
1. **Representation**: The maze is represented as a graph where each node corresponds to a cell in the maze and each edge represents a passable pathway between two adjacent cells.
   
2. **Starting and Ending Coordinates**: From the representation, the origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,4).

3. **Possible Pathways**: The maze transitions provided in the format `<cell1> <--> <cell2>` show directionless (bi-directional) connections between the maze cells.

4. **Finding Pathways**: A suitable method to solve the maze is using graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). These algorithms efficiently explore the graph to find a path from the origin to the destination:
   - BFS: This method explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level and would ensure the shortest path.
   - DFS: This method dives deeper into a node neighbor if possible, and uses recursion or a stack to backtrack.

5. **Execution**: Implementing BFS from (0,0) and iterating through destinations until (3,4) is reached or all possibilities are exhausted would give the desired path if available.

#### Calculation of Path:
Given the adjacency list, following a BFS approach:
1. From (0,0) to (1,0) (using BFS to find closest or direct paths)
2. From (1,0) to (1,1)
3. From (1,1) to (1,2)
4. From (1,2) to (2,2)
5. From (2,2) to (3,2)
6. From (3,2) to (3,3)
7. From (3,3) to (3,4)

#### Final Path Representation:
Thus, the maze solution path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (3,4) would be:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>`

This solution assumes that every move is valid as per the maze configurations provided in the adjacency list.
