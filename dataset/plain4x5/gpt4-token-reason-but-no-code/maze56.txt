To solve the maze given by the adjacency list, letâ€™s break down the solution approach:

1. **Representation**: First, extract the adjacency information to construct the maze's structure which we perceive as a graph where each node is a coordinate and edges exist where pathways connect these coordinates.

2. **Entry and Exit**: We have identified the entry and exit points from the tokens (`<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>` and `<TARGET_START> (3,4) <TARGET_END>`). This tells us where to start and where to aim to finish in the maze.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: To find the shortest path from the start to the exit, BFS is an appropriate choice because it explores neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted graph like this one where each step from one cell to adjacent cell is of equal weight.

Now, let's interpret the adjacency list into a workable format and apply BFS to determine the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,4)`. The BFS will explore all accessible nodes from a start point until it reaches the target or determines there is no route. 

Each row and corresponding connection represents reachable nodes; for example, `(0,3) <--> (0,2)` tells us from coordinate `(0,3)` we can go to `(0,2)` and vice versa.

Extracted Adjacency List:
- (0,3) connected to (0,2), (0,4)
- (1,2) connected to (1,1)
- (2,3) connected to (1,3), (3,3)
- (1,4) connected to (1,3), (0,4), (2,4)
- (3,3) connected to (3,2), (2,3)
- (2,4) connected to (1,4), (3,4)
- (3,1) connected to (2,1), (3,0)
- (1,1) connected to (1,0), (0,1)
- (0,4) connected to (0,3), (1,4)
- (1,0) connected to (2,0), (0,0), (1,1)
- (0,1) connected to (0,0), (1,1), (0,2)
- (2,0) connected to (3,0), (1,0)
- (3,0) connected to (2,0), (3,1)
- (3,2) connected to (3,3), (2,2)
... and so forth.

Using BFS from `(0,0)`, tracing a path through accessible nodes per the adjacency list:

- Starting from (0,0), explore neighbors (1,0), (0,1)
- From (0,1), explore neighbors (1,1), (0,2), then continue from (0,2) to (0,3)
- Continue from (0,3) to (0,4), from (0,4) to (1,4)
- From (1,4), progress to (2,4), and then from (2,4) to (3,4), which is the target.

Converting the explored and connected path into the final response format:
**<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>**

This path provides a direct route traversing through connected neighbours obtained from the adjacency list, leading from the start point to the exit of the maze efficiently using BFS principles to ensure the shortest route.
