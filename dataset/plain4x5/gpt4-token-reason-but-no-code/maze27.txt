The adjacency list provided specifies all the direct connections between points in a maze grid. To solve the maze from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,4), there are multiple strategies, such as depth-first search or breadth-first search, that can be used to traverse the maze. However, because of the given structure and the need to find an optimal path if possible, breadth-first search is preferred since it can find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as a grid maze.

By employing breadth-first search, we systematically explore the maze level by level, starting from the origin and gradually exploring all possible moves by following the connections defined, until we reach the target. We also keep track of the visited nodes to avoid cyclic paths and unnecessary traversal.

From analyzing the connectivity provided:
- Starting at (0,0), the next connectable node is (1,0).
- From (1,0), we can proceed to (2,0).
- (2,0) can then move to (3,0).
- From (3,0), following the connections leads us to (3,1).
- The path then goes successively through (3,2) to (3,3) and finally reaching (3,4).

This chain of moves indeed presents the shortest path per the maze configuration provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This sequence directly relies on the adjacency list provided and hence solves the maze from start to end using the shortest path where each move is verified against the adjacency relationships given.
