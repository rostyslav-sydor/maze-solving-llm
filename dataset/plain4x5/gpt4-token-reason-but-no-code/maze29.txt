To solve the maze described, the goal is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4). Using the adjacency list provided, we can see which cells connect directly to each other. Our task is to navigate through these connections starting from (0,0) and find a sequence of moves that leads us to (3,4).

A practical method here is to employ a breadth-first search (BFS), a widely used graph traversal technique that explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This strategy is especially fitting for a maze or graph scenario, where finding the shortest route is often critical.

Starting at coordinate (0,0), we check all connecting nodes in the adjacency list and move to those that are accessible, keeping track of the nodes we have visited to avoid loops. From each new node, repeat the process, gradually moving outwards until we reach (3,4) or identify that no path exists. Given that the path needs to be traced back from the target to the origin, we can use a predecessor or parent mapping to remember where each step came from, aiding in reconstructing the path once the target is reached.

Following this strategy with the adjacency list provided for the current maze and initializing from (0,0), we can indeed construct the path. Let's reconstruct the path using the described BFS method and the entities given between our origin and destination:

1. Start at (0,0), where you can proceed to (0,1) or (1,0).
2. From (0,1), the next options are (0,2) or back to (0,0).
3. Moving on to (0,2), the next possible movements are (0,1), (0,3), or back to (0,1).
4. At (0,3), continue to (0,4) or back to (0,2).
5. From (0,4) onwards, advance to (1,4) or back to (0,3).
6. Progressing to (1,4), the viable movement is (1,3) or back to (0,4).
7. From (1,3) backtrack to (1,4).
8. Next, shift to (1,4) and notice it directly connects to (2,4).
9. Progressing through (2,4), the options extend to (3,4) or back to previous connections.

Thus, careful application of BFS has led us to discover the following path to the exit:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path conclusively navigates from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,4) successfully using available connections from the adjacency list provided.
