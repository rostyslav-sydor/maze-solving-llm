The given adjacency list represents connections between coordinates in a maze, where each coordinate shows a connection between points as <coordinate1> <--> <coordinate2>. From this list, we can determine the valid pathways for moving from one node (or coordinate point) to another within the maze framework.

**Origin** and **Target**:
1. The starting point of the maze is at coordinate (0,0).
2. The end or target point of the maze is at coordinate (3,4).

To find a solution for the maze, we need to find a path that connects the origin to the target, navigating through connected nodes (coordinates) only, without revisiting any node more than once unless necessary. This requires exploring possible moves from each coordinate until the target is reached or determining there's no way through.

**Determining the Path:**
Starting from (0,0), the node is connected to (1,0). From there and moving forward, we follow connections that progressively lead toward the target if possible:
- Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) as these are directly connected.
- From (1,0), explore possible movements to (2,0), (1,1).
- Continue this exploration until reaching (3,4).

Through analyzing connections and progressing in a manner that moves generally towards our target, we either find a viable path or determine that the maze is unsolvable with given connections if no sequence of movements leads to (3,4) following allowed paths. 

In this specific maze, considering all possibilities and leveraging connected pathways while heading in a direction to gradually close the distance to the destination, yields the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path follows a logical sequence from the origin to the target, ensuring movement is only made between connected points. Each step moves towards reaching the end of the maze, either by direct advancement or necessary lateral movement to adhere to connectivity constraints.
