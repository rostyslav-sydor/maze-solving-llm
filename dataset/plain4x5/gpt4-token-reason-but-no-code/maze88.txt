To solve the maze, a search algorithm can be used on the represented graph to find a path from the origin point to the target point. A possible choice is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, known for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze of coordinate connections.

Given the adjacency relationships:

- The origin starts at (0,0).
- The target destination is (3,4).

Using BFS, we begin at node (0,0) and explore all its adjacent nodes. Here's the BFS expansion, keeping track of the path followed:

1. Begin at (0,0).
   - Adjacent: (1,0), (0,1).
2. Explore (1,0) from (0,0), and then (0,1) from (0,0).
   - (1,0) → Adjacent: (1,1).
   - (0,1) → Adjacent: (0,2).
3. Explore (1,1) from (1,0), and then (0,2) from (0,1).
   - (1,1) → Adjacent: (2,1).
   - (0,2) → Adjacent: (0,3).
4. Continue expanding:
   - From (2,1) → Adjacent: (2,0), (1,1).
   - From (0,3) → Adjacent: (0,4), (1,3).
   - From (0,4) → Adjacent: (1,4).
   - From (1,3) → Adjacent: (1,2).
5. Expand further, as needed, following connections:
   - (1,2) → Adjacent: (2,2).
   - (2,2) → Adjacent: (3,2).
   - (3,2) → Adjacent: (3,3).
   - (3,3) → Adjacent: (3,4).

Upon reaching (3,4) from (3,3), we have arrived at the target. Trace back the path taken:

- (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) to (0,4) to (1,4) to (3,4).

This gives the complete path from the entry point to the exit point. Let's list it as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This solution relies on Breadth-First Search to systematically explore each node level by level, ensuring the shortest path within an unweighted graph scenario, with the added tracking of node connections and paths to ascertain correct directions and eventual reach to the target.
