To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, I first understand the connections and layout of the maze paths. By finding the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4), I utilize a Breadth-First Search (BFS) technique because of its efficiency in exploring the shortest route in unweighted graphs like this one.

Hereâ€™s a closely followed step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify and parse the adjacency list which outlines all accessible paths between coordinates in the maze.
2. Begin at the origin point (0,0), marked with <ORIGIN_START>.
3. Use BFS to systematically explore neighbors of each point (step outwards from each vertex). Utilizing a queue, push the starting vertex and mark as visited.
4. For each vertex, explore all its connected nodes (neighbors) according to the adjacency list. If a node has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the path leading to it (predecessors) and enqueue it.
5. Continue this until the queue is empty or until the exit (target vertex, 3,4) is reached.
6. Construct the path from origin to target by backtracking using predecessors from the BFS, starting from the exit point backwards to the entry point.
7. Output the path found between the defined <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

After performing the BFS with the adjacency list provided and backtracking the path, the solution for the specific maze challenge here follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (0,4) (0,3) (0,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path transitions through every node smoothly from the start to the end point. The overall movement illustrates a proper sequencing as per the connections given in the adjacency list, ensuring an accurate solution to exit the maze.
