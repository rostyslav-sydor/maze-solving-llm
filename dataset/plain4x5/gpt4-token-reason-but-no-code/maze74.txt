The adjacency list provided details all the pathways in the maze through which one can traverse from one coordinate (node) to another. To find a solution, a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,4) is required, negating any cycles or dead ends.

Based on the provided adjacency relationships, a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be performed. BFS is typically favorable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, as it explores all paths from the source breadth-wise until it reaches the destination, ensuring the shortest path is achieved.

Starting at (0,0), I would use BFS to explore each adjacent coordinate, marking each as visited and recording the path taken. This continues until the target coordinate (3,4) is reached. By pulling the next available unvisited coordinate from the queue, BFS can assure all potential pathways are checked until the exit is found.

Based on this method, I traced out the connections as follows:
1. Start at (0,0), adjacent nodes are (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), move to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), we go to (1,3).
7. From (1,3), we go to (1,4).
8. From (1,4), continue to (2,4).
9. From (2,4), we reach the destination at (3,4).

The specific path followed is now outlined for clarity:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This solution provides a direct route from the start to the end of the maze, using BFS approach to ensure all shortest paths were explored in a systemic way. Each step is connected and follows the maze's layout as defined by the adjacency list, leading systematically from the origin to the target.
