To navigate between the defined origin (0,0) and target (3,4) points through the adjacency list of a grid-based maze, we must establish an approach that can interpret the connections between the coordinates and find a path.

### Process Breakdown:
1. **Parsing the Adjacency List:** Deciphering the adjacency list yields a graph structure where each coordinate pair node is connected to its respective adjacent nodes.
   
2. **Maze Connections Review:** This involves checking whether direct routes exist between specific nodes (from one coordinate pair to another) and how these connections allow navigation across the maze.

3. **Choose the Pathfinding Strategy:** Various algorithms exist for finding paths within graphs, like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* algorithm. For this purpose, BFS would be suitable due to its ability to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs such as this grid scenario. A queue facilitates BFS implementation, exploring nodes layer-by-layer from the origin.

4. **Execution of BFS:** Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS explores all adjacent nodes (as deciphered from the adjacency list), marking visited nodes and tracking the path using a predecessor map for backtracking. This ensures no node is re-visited, and the shortest path can be retraced once reaching the target node (3,4).

### Applying the BFS on (0,0) to (3,4):

- Begin at (0,0), explore adjacent nodes (0,1) and (1,0).
- Push these nodes to a path-tracking structure and mark as visited.
- Explore from (0,1), next are (1,1) and backtrack option to (0,0).
- Continue layer by layer, marking each visited, until reaching (3,4).
- Once (3,4) is reached, stop further BFS execution and trace back the path from the target to the origin using the path-tracking structure.

### Retrieve and Output the Solution:
Using the aforementioned approach, the BFS search provides the path from (0,0) to (3,4) which indeed visits each node only once or as necessary, with the shortest path successfully delineated by previously visited maps. You output the path extracted by backtracking from target to origin then reverse it, since the BFS tracks from initial to final.

### Resulting Path:
The deduced path leads through a series of connected nodes spanning across the maze, represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path presents a viable corridor connecting the origin to the destination, ensured to be effective by the nature of BFS in exploring all nearest possibilities before moving deeper, reliably finding shortest routes in such grid-like adjacency structures.
