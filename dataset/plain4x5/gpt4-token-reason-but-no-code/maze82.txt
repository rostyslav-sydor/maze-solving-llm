To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, one can envision the maze as a grid where each pair of coordinates are points in a connected graph. The goal is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4) using the connections defined by the adjacency relationships.

Reviewing the adjacency list, we create a mental map of how each point (cell in the maze) is connected to its neighbor(s). The origin (0,0) is the starting point and we are looking to reach the destination (3,4). We'll incrementally look for a path that adheres to these connections.

1. **Start at (0,0)** and check possible movement:
   - Connected to (0,1). Move to (0,1).

2. **From (0,1)**, next moves can be checked:
   - Connected to (1,1). Move to (1,1).

3. **At (1,1)**, explore next possible moves:
   - Connected to (1,0), but it leads away from desired direction. Ignore this.
   - Connected to (2,0) via (1,0) but it leads away from our target direction. Ignore this.
   - Connected to (1,2). Move to (1,2).

4. **From (1,2)**, evaluate options:
   - Connected to (1,3). Move to (1,3).

5. **At (1,3)**, check connections:
   - Connected to (1,4). Move to (1,4).

6. **At (1,4)**, consider the possibilities:
   - Connected to (0,4). Move to (0,4).
   - Connected to (2,4). Move to (2,4).

7. **From (2,4)**, consider next step:
   - Connected to (3,4). Move to (3,4), and we've reached our target.

The delineation of these steps confirms we have a clear path from (0,0) to (3,4), navigating through the grid respecting the adjacency points. This step-by-step exploration also ensures no backtracking to previously visited points, maintaining movement towards the target.

We, therefore, have a specific solution path for this maze provided by the adjacency list. The output of this path from the origin to the target is expressed as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This result follows logically considering the possible movements specified in the adjacency list, aiding in visualizing and confirming the connectivity within the maze to navigate from entry to exit efficiently.
