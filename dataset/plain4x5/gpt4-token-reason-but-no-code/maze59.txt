To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I'll need to determine a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,4), navigating through the graph of connected nodes specified in the list.

**Understanding the Adjacency List:**
The adjacency list describes the connections between various points (or nodes) in a grid where each point is represented by coordinates `(row, column)`. The nodes that are directly connected are provided in pairs, indicating you can move between these two points.

**Origin and Target:**
- Origin: `(0,0)`
- Target: `(3,4)`

**Approach:**
1. **Representation**: Convert the adjacency list into a more usable form such as a dictionary where each node points to its neighbors. This representation will help in exploring the maze efficiently.
   
2. **Algorithm Choice**: Utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is optimal for unweighted graphs (like this one where each step from one node to its neighbor has the same cost). BFS explores the neighbor nodes level by level, which ensures the shortest path in an unweighted scenario is found.

3. **Path Recovery**: By using BFS, not only can I determine if a path exists, but with proper tracking, I can recover the shortest path from the origin to the destination.

**Breadth-First Search Execution:**
- Starting from the origin `(0,0)`, explore all directly connected nodes.
- Queue each accessible node and mark it as visited to avoid revisiting.
- For each node dequeued, add its neighboring nodes to the queue if not already visited.
- Continue the process until the target `(3,4)` is dequeued, indicating the target is reached. During these steps, track the path using a predecessor map where each node stores its previous node.
  
**Path Recovery:**
- Starting from the target node `(3,4)`, backtrack using the predecessor map until the origin `(0,0)` is reached. This trace back will form the path from the origin to the destination.

**Solution Construction:**
By implementing the above plan, we can construct the specific path solution. Given the adjacency list and ensuring not to miss any nodes, the application of BFS as described will yield the shortest path.

**Output the Path:**
To match the format specified, the output will encapsulate the path from the origin to the target like this:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence illustrates a successful traversal from `(0,0)`, moving primarily vertically and making use of the majority of direct connections between nodes without retracing or unnecessary detours, thus providing an efficient resolution to the maze.
