To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, I'll start by understanding the connectivity between the nodes, identifying the starting (origin) and target (exit) points, and then finding a path from the origin to the target using an efficient search algorithm.

From the adjacency list provided:
- The graph connections (edges between nodes) are defined for each pair of directly connected coordinates or cells in a grid format, indicating passages in the maze.
- The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,4).

To solve the maze:
1. **Parse the Adjacency List**: Convert the list of connections into a map of nodes, where each node contains its neighbors.
2. **Implement a Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path due to its layer-by-layer exploration.
3. **Extract the Path**: From the BFS search, one can backtrack from the target to the origin using a predecessor map filled during the BFS traversal.

The BFS starts at the origin and explores all its neighbors, then the neighbors' neighbors, and so on until it reaches the target or exhausts all paths. This strategy ensures that the first time the BFS reaches the target (3,4), it has found the shortest path due to its systematic, level-based exploration nature.

### Given the Maze's Graph:
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,4)

Using the BFS approach on this specific adjacency list configuration, and based on the connections, we find that:
- Path starts at (0,0)
- Follow to (0,1)
- Then (1,1)
- Then (2,1)
- Then continue to (3,1)
- Move to (3,2)
- Next to (3,3)
- Finally reach (3,4)

This path is derived by exploring each nodeâ€™s neighbors and ensuring that it continues from the start to the end without any interruptions, as permitted by the listed connections. Assuming optimal connectivity and no barriers not listed, this valid path-style answers the specifics of the adjacency information provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This resulting path ensures that it navigates through the maze from the origin to the target using a connected and valid route.
