In the given adjacency list, we observe nodes, which are represented by coordinates on a grid, and their direct connections. The maze requires a solution path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,4). To solve the maze, we need to trace a path through connected nodes starting from the origin and ending at the target. This means finding a sequence of coordinates where each consecutive pair is directly connected as listed in the adjacency list.

Considering the structure of the maze and its adjacency:

1. **Start at the Origin:** The maze starts at (0,0).
2. **Look for connections from (0,0):** From the adjacency list, (0,0) is connected to (0,1).
3. **Proceed sequentially exploring connected nodes:**
   - From (0,1), go to (1,1) which is legal as per adjacency.
   - From (1,1), go to (1,2).
   - From (1,2), continue to (1,3).
   - From (1,3), connect to (0,3).
   - From (0,3), move to (0,4).
   - From (0,4), head to (1,4).
   - From (1,4), go to (2,4).
   - From (2,4), travel to (3,4).

Following this sequence, we ensure that each move is supported by a direct edge in the adjacency list.

Putting it all together in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves forms a valid solution where each step is connected per the adjacency rules, leading from the origin to the target. This path meets the condition of moving through directly connected nodes from the start to the end of the maze.
