In the provided adjacency list graph, each pair of coordinates represents connections in the maze where the player can move between points. The origin (entry point of the maze) is given as (0,0), and the target (exit point of the maze) is (3,4). 

To find a solution, we need to identify a path from the origin to the target navigating through connected coordinates. I analyzed the provided adjacency list to map out which cells are interconnected, then traced a route from the start to the end.

Based on the paths described in the adjacency list:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Moving vertically, you can navigate from (0,0) to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
4. Go from (0,2) to (0,3), continuing vertically in the same column.
5. Now, go from (0,3) to (1,3) diagonally.
6. Move from (1,3), to (1,2), and then to (2,2) as per adjacency paths.
7. From (2,2), go down to (2,3).
8. Move horizontally from (2,3) to (3,3).
9. Finally, reach the target by moving from (3,3) to (3,4).

Thus, the path that would be taken from the origin to the target through the maze, following these connections would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of steps uses the available connections in the adjacency list optimally, and successfully navigates from the entry to the exit of the maze.
