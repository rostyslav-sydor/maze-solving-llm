The maze has been represented as an adjacency list containing the direct connections between points in a grid-like structure. Each point is shown in the format (row, column). In the provided information, the adjacency list includes all passable connections between pairs of adjacent points in the maze. The edges do not imply any impassable walls directly; they just express direct connections between two points.

To find the solution to this maze puzzle, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4). Since a breadth-first search (BFS) is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid, this method helps ensure we find the shortest route through the maze given its layout and connectivity.

Under this scheme:
- Each node or vertex in the graph represents a coordinate or point in the maze.
- Each edge represents a passable connection between two adjacent nodes.
- We start the search from (0,0) and use BFS to explore all reachable nodes using a queue to handle the nodes to be explored and a dictionary or similar structure to track visited nodes and to trace back to the path from the target to the origin once the target has been reached.

After applying BFS to the maze's adjacency list from origin (0,0) to target (3,4), tracing the path from the exit back to the entrance, you can derive the required path. Here's the specific BFS-derived path for this maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path comprises the sequence of moves from the start point to the exit of the maze, visiting only accessible nodes as per the adjacency list, and does not revisit any point, showing a simple and direct solution following the BFS traversal principles.
