To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, an appropriate pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be applied. BFS is particularly useful as it guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is the case here where all moves have equal weight.

From the adjacency list, it's evident that nodes, representing coordinates in the maze, connect to one another in specific patterns indicating where one can move from a given point. The origin of the maze is (0,0) and the target to reach is (3,4).

Utilizing BFS:
1. Start at the origin node (0,0).
2. From each node, explore all directly connected nodes that have not been visited.
3. Add the current node to a queue of nodes to be processed, and mark it as visited.
4. For each node processed, track the path taken to reach it, allowing backtracking from the destination to the origin to determine the actual path taken.
5. Continue expanding and exploring until the target node (3,4) is reached.

Executing the BFS on the provided adjacency list in practical steps:
- Begin at (0,0), discovering neighbors and moving toward the target.
- The exploration proceeds by looking at immediate neighbors, then the neighbors' neighbors, expanding outward in concentric "rings" from the origin.
- Each step or move is determined by what is directly reachable from any current position within unvisited paths, ensuring the shortest path owing to the nature of BFS that processes nodes level by level, or layer by layer.

Based on the adjacency list and the BFS approach applied to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4), the solution path can be delineated as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents a sequence of moves from the start to the end of the maze that successfully navigates the connections defined in the adjacency list, ensuring no revisits to any node which would imply redundancy and inefficiency in the path.
