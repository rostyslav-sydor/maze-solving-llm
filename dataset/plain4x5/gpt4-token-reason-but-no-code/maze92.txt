The given maze is represented as an adjacency list meaning each vertex or node (coordinate in the maze) is listed along with its directly connected adjacent nodes. Analysis begins by reading and mapping these connections into a structure that allows for traversal - typically a graph.

Given the origin coordinate (0,0) and target coordinate (3,4), the task is to find a path from the origin to the target navigating through the connections as defined in the adjacency list.

Starting from the origin:
- The maze describes which cells are directly reachable from any cell.
- A common approach to find a path in such a graph is using a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS is particularly handy for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which in this context implies finding the minimum number of moves from the origin to the destination.

By applying BFS:
1. Start from (0,0), and explore each adjacent coordinate as provided in the list.
2. Move sequentially through accessible paths marking each visited node to prevent revisiting and keep track of the path taken using a predecessor relation.
3. Continue spreading out through the maze until the destination (3,4) is reached.

For the specific maze:
- From (0,0), you can go to (0,1) and (1,0) based on the adjacency list.
- From (0,1) you can move to (1,1).
- Continue moving through the maze using adjacency pairs like links in a chain; each move must be logically justified by an adjacent connection until the target is reached.

Carefully exploring all paths, we would finalize a solution when reaching (3,4).

So following the BFS applied to the maze's adjacency information, and deducing the correct path where each step is connected to the prior:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

Here, each step moves to an adjacent coordinate that directly links to the previous step, successfully navigating from (0,0) to (3,4).
