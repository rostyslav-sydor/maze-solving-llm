To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, one needs to find a path from the specified origin (0,0) to the target (3,4). The adjacency list provides all the connections between cells in the maze, showing which pairs of cells are directly accessible to one another.

Starting from the origin (0,0), the path must traverse the maze through connected nodes until reaching the target. Here's the reasoning:

1. From the adjacency list, it is clear that each cell coordinate is connected to at least one other cell. Hence, following an appropriate sequence of connections should lead us from the origin to the target.
   
2. By reviewing the listed connections, a possible path can be identified that leads to the target without backtracking through previously visited nodes.

3. The connections `(0,0)` to `(0,1)`, `(0,1)` to `(0,2)`, `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`, and so on can be sequentially checked, affording a progression towards the target.

Based on the adjacency list, here is one possible solution traced through reachable nodes:
- Start at the origin point `(0,0)` and move to an adjacent node `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, move to `(0,2)`, then to `(0,3)`. 
- From `(0,3)`, move to `(0,4)`, then to `(1,4)`. 
- From `(1,4)`, progress to `(2,4)`. 
- Lastly, from `(2,4)`, move to the target `(3,4)`.

This path strictly follows the connections provided, ensuring each move is valid based on the given adjacency relationships. The traversal progresses from the origin directly to the target by moving through connected nodes without repetition.

Accordingly, the specific solution to the maze represented in the desired format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>
