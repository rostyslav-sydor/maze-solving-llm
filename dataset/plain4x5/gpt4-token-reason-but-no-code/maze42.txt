To find a path through the maze presented in the adjacency list, we utilize a graph traversal algorithm to explore potential paths from the origin to the target. The maze pathways between cells are represented as adjacency relationships.

By setting up the given adjacency information in a structured way that represents connections between each node (representing cells in the maze), we ensure that we evaluate all possible routes efficiently without unnecessary repetition or backtracking.

In analyzing this specific maze layout:
- The starting point (origin) is (0, 0).
- The end point (target) is (3, 4).

A suitable method to navigate this graph structure is by employing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This approach systematically explores all adjacent nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which ensures the shortest path is found in an unweighted graph, such as this maze where each move from one cell to another is uniform in 'cost'.

Applying BFS:
1. Start at (0, 0).
2. Explore all directly connected cells, then their connections, and so on.
3. Continue until we reach the target cell (3, 4).

Given the adjacency list and employing BFS, the steps taken, starting from (0,0) and navigating through connected paths efficiently while ensuring we reach (3,4) are as enumerated in the result. During BFS implementation, a queue is typically used to store nodes to be explored, and a mechanism to track visited nodes ensures no cell is processed more than once, preventing cycles and redundant work.

Analyzing all connections in the provided adjacent list, here is the BFS result:

Starting at (0,0), possible movements based on direct connections:
To (1,0), (0,1).

Through continous exploration where we keep in mind to evaluate all possible shortest paths through connections, we steer through to (3,4) as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path is chosen based on available connections between the nodes and ensures minimal steps from start to finish, as expected from the BFS approach in an unweighted grid scenario.
