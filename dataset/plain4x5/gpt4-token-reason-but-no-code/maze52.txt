To find a path through this maze described as an adjacency list between the designated origin and target coordinates, I will simulate traversal ideas from graph theory, particularly using a breadth-first search (BFS) technique. BFS is chosen because it efficiently explores all neighboring points level by level, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one will be found quickly.

Given the adjacency list representation of the graph:
- Each pair represents a bidirectional connection, meaning you can travel between these two points.
- The starting point is (0,0) and our goal is to reach the endpoint (3,4).

Following the BFS steps and interpretation of adjacency list:
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Move to its neighbors, and keep track of the paths taken in a queue.
3. Continue exploring all neighbors of each node using the queue until the target node (3,4) is reached.
4. To prevent revisiting nodes and thus looping indefinitely, mark nodes as visited as they are explored.

For the given maze, following this BFS method considering all accessible moves from each point and meticulously keeping track, we reach the point (3,4) by one of the possible shortest paths, traced as follows:

Starting at (0,0), visiting (0,1), then (1,1), followed by (2,1), moving on to (3,1), next to (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), and finally reaching (3,4).

This results in the sequence:
- Begin at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (1,1)
- Move to (2,1)
- Move to (3,1)
- Move to (3,0) [optional move, can be backtracked]
- Back to (3,1)
- Move to (3,2)
- Move to (3,3)
- Final move to (3,4)

Output the solution for this specific maze:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This path fulfills the requirement of reaching the endpoint (3,4) from the origin (0,0), taking the short and valid paths based on the adjacency connectivity provided.
