To solve the maze given in the adjacency list, which defines the connections possible between various points in the maze grid, I'll start by interpreting and visualizing the adjacency list to form a graph. This graph will then be analyzed to determine the shortest path from the start (origin) point to the end (target) point. The connections in the adjacency form the edges between nodes. The origin node is (0,0) and the target node is (3,4).

Given the connections:

- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (0,3) <--> (0,4)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (3,3) <--> (3,4)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (2,4) <--> (2,3)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (0,4) <--> (1,4)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,4) <--> (2,4)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)

Using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path, we can determine the optimal solution. Here, BFS is likely the simplest and most effective, as it explores all nearest neighbors (nodes) level by level which is perfect for an unweighted graph such as this one (where all edges have the same 'weight' or cost).

Thus, using a BFS approach:
- Start at (0,0)
- Explore all adjacent nodes (there are edges to (1,0) and (0,1))
- From (0,1), explore (0,2)
- Continuing this process and following the path which leads closest towards the target location:

Tracing through the maze using the above connections logically or by creating an exploratory algorithm in a suitable programming language:
- Start at (0,0) -> next (0,1) -> next (0,2) -> next (1,2)
- From (1,2) -> go to (1,3) -> next (1,4)
- From (1,4) -> move to (2,4)
- From (2,4) -> move to (2,3) and then to (3,3)
- From (3,3) -> go to (3,4) which is the target

The path thus created through logical exploration or algorithmic computational process would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This solution is deduced through simulating the maze path options and connections, ensuring each step advances toward the target while following valid passages as outlined by the adjacency list.
