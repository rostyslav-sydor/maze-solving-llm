To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, the primary task is to identify a path from the designated origin to the target. The maze is represented such that each pair of coordinates `(x, y) <--> (a, b)` expresses a direct passage between two points on a grid. 

The origin of the maze is `(0,0)` and the destination is `(3,4)`. A valid strategy for solving the maze is to construct a representation that allows for navigation through the graph, connecting nodes together based on the adjacencies provided.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis on figuring out the path from the origin to the target:

1. **Setup and Representation**: Structure the adjacency list in a more exploitable form like a traditional graph where each point can have pointers or references to its neighboring accessible points. This can be held, for instance, in a dictionary data structure in programming.

2. **Select Algorithm for Pathfinding**: For graph traversal, Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) are commonly used algorithms. Given this is a small grid with specific points connecting to others without weighted edges, BFS is appropriate as it would find the shortest path, which is typically preferred in mazes.

3. **Implementing BFS for Pathfinding**:
   - Begin at the origin `(0,0)`, pushing it into a queue.
   - Expand to adjacent points based on the adjacency list; for each node, keep a record of its predecessor to trace the path back once the destination is reached.
   - For `(0,0)`, the next points are `(0,1)`, continuing similarly until all points are explored or the target `(3,4)` is reached.
   
4. **Reconstruct Path**: Once the target `(3,4)` is found, backtrack from the target to the origin using the predecessor record to get the path.

Starting the step-by-step BFS path exploration:
- From `(0,0)` you travel to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, you can move to `(0,2)` then to `(0,3)`.
- At `(0,3)`, you then proceed to `(1,3)`, and subsequently to `(1,4)`.
- From `(1,4)`, finally moving onto `(2,4)`, and finishing at `(3,4)`.

Thus, by putting all together following this found path:

**Solution**: `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>`. 

This path accurately follows through the valid connections as per the adjacency definition, ensuring a valid route from the start to the end of the maze as per the requirements.
