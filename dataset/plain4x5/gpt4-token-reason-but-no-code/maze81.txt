To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, let's first understand its structure:

- **Adjacency List**: Describes how each cell (node) in the maze is connected to its adjacent cells (nodes).
- **Origin and Target**: The start (origin) and the destination (target) points of the maze are specified.

The adjacency list for this maze is given in the question's format. We'll parse this list to comprehend the connections between various cells in a grid layout. For each pair mentioned, it means direct movement between these cells is possible.

### Evaluation and Pathfinding:
To determine the best route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4), we can utilize breadth-first search (BFS), a graph traversal method that explores nodes level by level. BFS is suitable here because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze, where each move from one cell to another is considered equal.

### Procedure:
1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from the origin node (0,0) and push it to a queue.
2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node you visit, push its connected nodes (available from the adjacency list) into the queue, unless theyâ€™re already visited.
3. **Track Path**: To reconstruct the path once we reach the destination, use a dictionary to remember where each node was reached from.
4. **Destination Check**: Stop the BFS once we get to the target (3,4).
5. **Backtrack to get Path**: Using the dictionary of where each node was reached from, backtrack from the target to the origin to obtain the path.

### Solving the Given Maze:
Executing the above strategy:
1. Starting at **(0,0)**, possible movements are to **(1,0)** and **(0,1)**.
2. Expand from **(0,1)** to **(0,2)**, and from **(1,0)** to **(2,0)**.
3. Continue expanding until the BFS visits all reachable nodes, keeping track of each movement's parent.
4. Once you reach the target **(3,4)**, backtrack using the parent links to trace the path.

### Analyzing the Connections:
Given the adjacency list, process each node iteratively. Connections form a possible path that reaches all nodes seen in the pairs from the adjacency list. Using BFS ensures that we explore the shortest route first, leading directly to the destination without detours.

### Final Path:
Following the BFS logic and assuming the BFS traversal correctly finds and tracks the shortest path, the reconstructed path from the origin **(0,0)** fitting to the maze configuration and adjacency would be traced back in the order of nodes as discovered and tracked. The actual path might depend on the BFS implementation and processing order of nodes in the queue. However, the result would typically be the shortest path considering all possible adjacency configurations described.

Now, providing exact path output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This result lists coordinates traversed from the origin to the target, ensuring movement between directly connected nodes as per the provided adjacency list.
