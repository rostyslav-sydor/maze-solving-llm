The given adjacency list provides all the possible pathways between coordinates in the maze, with specific points designated as the entry and exit. In this scenario, the origin or entry point is (0,0) and the target or exit point is (3,4).

To find a path from the origin to the target:
1. **Understand the problem**: We need to navigate from start to finish by moving through connected nodes (coordinates).
  
2. **Utilize a suitable method for traversal**: Given the structured format of the maze, a breadth-first search (BFS) approach is typically suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

3. **Trace possible routes from (0,0) to (3,4)**, considering adjacency:
   - BFS will consider all accessible neighbors from a node before moving onto nodes further away, essentially moving level by level.

Let's diagrammatically trace routes and pick the one following BFS principles:
   - Start at (0,0)
   - Move to connected node (1,0)
   - Then, reach (1,1)
   - Move next to (1,2)
   - Proceed to (1,3)
   - Connect directly to (0,3) or pass through (2,3) and then to (2,4)
   - From (1,3) moving via (2,3) and then (2,4)
   - Finally, from (2,4) connect to the end point (3,4).

This traced path uses BFS strategy, moving level by level across nearest neighbors until the destination is reached from the given maze structure.

Therefore, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through connected coordinates from the origin to the destination efficiently, representing a plausible solution for escaping the maze according to the provided adjacency list.
