The maze provided is represented through an adjacency list, detailing how various points (coordinates) connect to each other, thus forming navigable paths. To find a solution – a path from the starting point (entry, origin) to the ending point (exit, target) – we need to traverse this maze in a structured manner, ensuring the chosen path starts from the origin and reaches the destination.

Given the structure of the maze, we can employ a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Both these algorithms are suitable for finding a path in a graph-based setup like this maze. BFS is typically more suited in many pathfinding contexts as it can find the shortest path within an unweighted graph, which appears to be the case here with each move between coordinates having uniform "cost" or distance.

In this maze:

- The start (origin) point is at coordinate (0,0).
- The goal (target) is at coordinate (3,4).

Using BFS, we start at the origin, explore its neighbors, and continue exploring the neighbors of these points till the target is reached. From BFS, not only can we verify a path exists, but also identify the sequence of steps taken to reach the target, provided we track the path correctly.

Let's proceed logically through the adjacency list and initiate BFS from (0,0):

1. Start of BFS from (0,0); neighbors: (1,0) and (0,1).
2. Explore (1,0); neighbors: (2,0) and (1,1).
3. Then explore (0,1); neighbors: (0,2).
4. From (1,0) to (2,0); neighbor: (3,0).
5. From (0,2); neighbors to (0,3).
6. From (3,0) to (3,1); neighbors: (2,1).
7. From (0,3) to (0,4); next point: (1,4).
8. From (3,1) to (2,1) and from there to (2,2); next, (2,1) to (3,2) and then to (3,3).
9. From (1,4) to (1,3) and then to (1,2).
10. From (3,3) to (3,4) which is our target.

Collecting this information, a valid path from (0,0) to (3,4) using the BFS approach, which passes through connected points and tracking back the path from BFS would look something like:
- Start from (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4)

So, the output path normatively should be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

Notice that this logical reasoning assumes no dead ends were taken, and acceptable alternative paths might exist if other sequences of points were explored differently. The provided solution is optimal according to the BFS strategy, typically progressing layer by layer uniformly outwards from the start.
