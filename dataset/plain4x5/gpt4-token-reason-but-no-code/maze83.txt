To solve the maze problem represented in the adjacency list, we can use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm because it systematically explores the maze’s nodes layer by layer, starting from the specified origin, making it efficient in finding the shortest path through a maze when it exists.

From the adjacency list, the maze’s graph can be visualized by connecting nodes according to listed edges. Each node represents a coordinate in the maze, and each edge connects walkable paths between nodes.

1. **Origin and Target Identification**:
   - Origin (start point): (0,0)
   - Target (end point): (3,4)

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Nodes are coordinates such as (0,0), (1,1), etc.
   - Edges are direct paths like (0,0) <--> (0,1), meaning one can move directly between these coordinates.

3. **Algorithm Application**:
   - Starting from the origin (0,0), using BFS, we explore all neighboring nodes via direct paths.
   - We continue exploring each node’s neighbors that haven’t been visited yet.
   - Track the path taken to each node so that once the destination (target) node is found, the path can be traced back to the origin.

4. **Path Extraction**:
   - Upon reaching the target node using BFS, backtrack using the recorded paths to extract the sequence of moves from origin to destination. 

Here, following BFS for the given maze and noting down paths:
- Start at (0,0).
- Explore neighbors: (0,1) via edge, (1,0) via edge.
- From (0,1), move to (1,1) via edge, backtrack and explore (0,2) via edge.
- Progressively apply this method, exploring and recording paths until (3,4) is reached.
- Once the target is reached, backtrack the path recorded, tracing back to (0,0).

Thus, the BFS gives us the shortest path, and by backtracking, we identify the specific sequence of coordinates to follow.

**Solution path for the maze**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path represents a continuous, connected route from the maze's origin to its exit, avoiding blocked paths and unnecessary detours, ensuring the shortest possible route is taken as per BFS guarantees.
