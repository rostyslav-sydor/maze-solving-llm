To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list, we first extract meaningful information about paths between cells and entry/exit points.

From the adjacency list:
- Cells such as (0,0), (0,1), etc., represent points in the maze.
- Links like (0,2) <--> (1,2) show that cell (0,2) is directly connected to cell (1,2).

Given:
- Entry point (origin) at (0,0).
- Exit point (target) at (3,4).

Approach:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all possible paths using a basic Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm, which is generally effective for unweighted pathfinding on a graph like this.
3. Track paths from the origin to neighboring cells, following links provided in the adjacency list.
4. Continuously expand to the neighboring cells until the target cell (exit) is reached.
5. Record the successful path from entry to exit.

Step-by-Step Navigation (as derived from the adjacency list and BFS strategy):
- From (0,0) we can go to (1,0) and to (0,1).
- Continue exploring each path:
    - From (1,0) extend to (2,0) following the chain of connections.
    - From (2,0), move to (2,1) and then to (3,1). 
    - From (3,1) advance to (3,0) or (3,2). Choose (3,2) since it’s more in the direction of the exit. 
    - Continue from (3,2) to (3,3) then to (3,4).

- Backtracking and connecting these steps reveals our successful path. Plotting the path with all the connections from the adjacency list, you get:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This specific path is verified as there’s a direct connection between every consecutive pair of coordinates mentioned in the adjacency list, ensuring no breaks or invalid steps in the journey from the origin to the target.
