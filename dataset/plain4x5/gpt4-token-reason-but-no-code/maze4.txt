To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I will first interpret the list to understand the graph structure, which describes how each coordinate (node) is connected to others. After summarizing the graph, we can apply a graph traversal algorithm to find a path from the origin to the target point.

### Step 1: Interpret the Adjacency List
The adjacency list defines connections between points in the maze:
- `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`, `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`, `(0,2) <--> (0,3)`, `(0,3) <--> (0,4)`
- `(0,3) <--> (1,3)`, `(1,3) <--> (1,4)`, `(1,4) <--> (2,4)`, `(2,4) <--> (3,4)`
- Similar connections exist among other points.

### Step 2: Identify Start and End Points
The maze starts at `(0,0)` and the goal is to reach `(3,4)`.

### Step 3: Select and Apply a Pathfinding Algorithm
Given the graphical nature of the maze, Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) could be applicable. However, to ensure we find the shortest path, BFS is more suitable since it explores neighbors level by level. 

### Step 4: Execute BFS
Starting from `(0,0)`, explore all possible routes using BFS until reaching `(3,4)`. During this exploration, maintain a record of each nodeâ€™s parent to reconstruct the path once the target is found.

### Solution:
Performing BFS results in discovering paths and backtracking to form the shortest path from origin to target. After executing the algorithm:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>
```

This path indicates each move from the start point `(0,0)` to the end point `(3,4)` through the maze following the available connections, resulting in a direct and efficient route. The path listed directly moves through horizontally adjacent or vertically adjacent cells, moving right and up, while adhering to the adjacency rules given.
