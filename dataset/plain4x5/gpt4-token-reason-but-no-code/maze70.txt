To solve the maze, I built a graph from the adjacency list provided, and then used a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4).

**Graph Construction**: The adjacency list within the prompt indiciates which nodes (cells in the maze) are directly accessible from each other. I started by converting this textual adjacency list into a graph representation by connecting nodes according to the list.

**Pathfinding**: Using DFS, a path-finding algorithm suitable for exploratory and unweighted problems like mazes, I searched through the graph starting from the origin. The algorithm marks nodes as visited and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Execution**: During the DFS execution, when the target node (3,4) was reached, the path traveled from the starting node (0,0) was recorded. This recorded path is used as the solution to the maze.

**Solution**: Following through with DFS for the maze detailed in the question, the path found from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This specific path was determined by meticulously following each node connection as allowed by the adjacency list, ensuring a solution that does not stray from established paths between nodes, and terminates as soon the target is reached.
