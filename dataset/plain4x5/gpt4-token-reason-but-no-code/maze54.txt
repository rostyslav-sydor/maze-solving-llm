To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we'll need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4). I am using a method to traverse through the graph to determine the shortest or valid path from the entry to the exit point of the maze. The adjacency list essentially creates an undirected graph with nodes representing coordinates in a grid and edges between those nodes depicting paths one can take.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Origin and Target Identification**: From the description, the origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,4).
2. **Graph Construction**: Using the adjacency pairs from the adjacency list to create a graph. Each pair of coordinates is connected, meaning you can move between those two points freely.
3. **Pathfinding Implementation**: Here, a suitable algorithm would be BFS (Breadth-First Search) which is typically used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures that the first time we reach the target node, it must be via one of the shortest possible paths.
4. **Execution**: Using BFS on the constructed graph starting from (0,0), we keep track of our path and previously visited nodes until we reach the target (3,4).

When applied to the graph from the adjacency list, the BFS algorithm would proceed as follows (starting from (0,0)):

- Open the BFS queue with the origin, marking it as visited.
- Explore each neighboring node. From (0,0), we move to (0,1) and (1,0). At each step, keep track of the previous node to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.
- Continue the exploration from new frontiers: from (0,1) go to (1,1) and from (1,0) go to (2,0) and so on, ensuring we only progress through unvisited nodes.
- Progress until the target (3,4) is reached.

Following these principles and tracing through the connectivity from the start node, the proper execution would lead to discovering the following path from (0,0) to (3,4):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence navigates through connected points, steadily advancing toward the destination, ensuring at each step to progress in a way that moves closer or through valid paths to the endpoint, ultimately reaching from the origin to the target in the maze structure provided.
