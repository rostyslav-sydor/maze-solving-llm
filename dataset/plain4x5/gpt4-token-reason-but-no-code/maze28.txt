The maze presented here is represented by an adjacency list linking various nodes (coordinates) in the maze. Each pair of nodes connected by `<-->` indicates a pathway between these two points in the maze grid. To solve the maze, one basically needs to find a connected path from the specified origin point (entry of the maze) to the target point (exit of the maze).

The origin point is marked by `(0,0)` and the target point is `(3,4)`. To solve the maze, we need to navigate through the pathways indicated by adjacency list starting from the origin and exploring possible routes to get to the target.

From the adjacency list:
- From `(0,0)`, one can move to `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`.
- Continuing this exploration methodically and avoiding revisiting nodes (or equivalently, marking nodes as visited), we can trace a path from the origin to the target. 
- By exploring paths (breadth-first or depth-first), we keep looking at adjacent nodes till we find a one leading to the target point. 

Using a pathfinding method (like BFS or DFS adjusted for grid navigation), the steps followed from `(0,0)` to `(3,4)` navigating through valid pathways (adjacent nodes linked in the adjacency list) gives the path.

Hence, the solution to this maze upon examining the adjacency list and routing paths from start to exit results in the traversal:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This path sequences through coordinates demonstrating an accessible path from the entrance at `(0,0)` to the exit at `(3,4)`. The key here is to utilize the adjacency connections provided, ensuring each step moves from one node to its directly connected node, ultimately reaching the maze's exit.
