To solve this maze, first the adjacency list is used to determine the possible paths between nodes of the maze, where each node represents a coordinate (row, column) on the grid. Each adjacent pair indicates a direct connection or passage between two points in the maze, which allows movement from one to the other.

Therefore, the task at hand is to locate a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,4). To do this effectively, a graph traversal method, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), is applied typically. BFS is particularly useful in unweighted grids like this, as it ensures the shortest path is found when moving from node to node. BFS explores all neigbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thus ensuring shortest paths in an unweighted scenario are recognized first.

Upon utilizing BFS:
1. Start from the origin (0,0) and enqueue it.
2. Explore all adjacent (directly connected) nodes.
3. Each explored node is enqueued and its predecessor is noted, until the target (3,4) is reached.
4. Upon reaching the target, backtrack using the noted predecessors to reconstruct the path from the target to the origin.
5. As adjacency denotes passages, follow through the nodes reached to create a sequence from (0,0) to (3,4).

Accordingly, by processing and exploring the adjacency pairs and using BFS, the precise route from (0,0) to (3,4) can be traced and verified to comply with available passages.

Thus, the solution for the maze based on BFS traversal is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence shows a logical progression from the origin to the target, reflecting a plausible and efficient path considering the connections available in the provided maze definition.
