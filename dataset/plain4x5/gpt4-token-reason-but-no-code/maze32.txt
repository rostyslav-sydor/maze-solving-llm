The maze's structure is defined by an adjacency list showing which cells of the maze are directly connected to each other. The main objective is to navigate from the entry point, labeled as the origin, to the exit point, labeled as the target.

From the maze details featuring connections, we recognize that we can employ a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to systematically explore the maze and find a valid path from the origin to the target.

Here, the origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,4). Given the maze size and connections, using BFS is beneficial for this problem as BFS will find the shortest path between the starting and ending points, which is generally preferred for pathfinding in mazes.

Using BFS:
1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all neighboring nodes explicitly connected in the adjacency list.
3. Track visited nodes (or coordinates) to avoid revisits and looping.
4. Continue expanding level by level until the target is reached or all possible paths are explored.

Applying BFS while considering the adjacency relationships defined in the maze:
- From (0,0), explore to (0,1).
- From (0,1), further explore to (1,1).
- (1,1) expands to two more points: (1,2).
- From (1,2), (0,2) can be reached but it doesn't help in progressing towards the target. Instead, (1,2) â†’ (1,3).
- From (1,3), expand to (2,3) and continue to (2,4).
- From (2,4), the adjacency to (3,4) takes you directly to the target.

Compiling these steps, the path to solve the maze from point (0,0) to (3,4) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This solution efficiently demonstrates the maze navigation from the entry to the exit using the shortest path available within the given connections.
