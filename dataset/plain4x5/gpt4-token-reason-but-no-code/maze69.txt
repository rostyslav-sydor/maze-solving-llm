In the provided maze, each coordinate pair corresponds to a location within the maze, and the pairs of coordinate pairs in the adjacency list describe connections between these locations. The objective is to find a path from the origin to the target within this specific structure of connected nodes.

The given origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,4). To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) to systematically visit and explore all possible paths in the shortest-path manner from the origin to the target. BFS is ideal in this case because it explores neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This guarantees that the first time we reach our target node, it's done through the shortest possible path.

Using BFS:
1. Start at the origin node (0,0).
2. Visit all adjacent nodes, recording the paths taken.
3. From each of those nodes, explore their adjacent nodes that haven't been visited.
4. Continue this process until the target (3,4) is reached. 
5. Track the nodes traversed in the shortest path found.

Let's implement this on the maze connections provided:

- Start BFS from (0,0).
- Visit (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1).
- Visit (1,0) via (0,0) <--> (1,0).
- From (0,1), visit (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2).
- From (1,0), visit (2,0) via (1,0) <--> (2,0).
- Continuing this pattern while keeping track of visited nodes and their pathways:
  from (0,3) eventually get to (1,3), then (1,4), (2,4) and finally (3,4).

By marking each visited node and using the adjacency list to check for further possible moves, we can determine that a possible shortest path from (0,0) to (3,4) is:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4).

Thus, the solution path for this maze, in specified format, would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END> 

This path is derived considering the adjacency connections in the list and exploring systematically from the origin towards the target while tracing the shortest route available as described.
