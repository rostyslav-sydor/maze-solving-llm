To solve the maze problem described in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,4), navigating through connected nodes specified in the list.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Construct the Graph**:
   - Translate the adjacency list into a graph format where each node (coordinate pair) has edges representing passages to adjacent nodes.

2. **Finding the Path**:
   - Apply a pathfinding algorithm such as the Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is particularly effective for unweighted graphs like mazes.
   - Start from the origin node (0,0) and explore all possible movements through its connections, adhering to the adjacency rules described.
   - Continue exploring from each node until the target (3,4) is found or all possible paths are exhausted.

3. **Path Tracking**:
   - While traversing, track the path traversed using parent-pointers or a similar mechanism to ensure that once the target node is reached, the full path from origin to target can be reconstructed.

### Reasoning for Using BFS:
- BFS explores the nearest neighbors first before moving on to nodes that are further away, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found - which is efficient for this maze scenario.

### Specific Solution for Given Maze:
Given the problem's specific connections (edges between nodes), we apply BFS starting from (0,0):

- First explore direct neighbors and then their neighbors recursively.
- According to the BFS and given adjacencies, one possible shortest path found from (0,0) to (3,4) is:

  - Start from (0,0), connected to (0,1)
  - From (0,1) move to (1,1), which is connected
  - Then move to (2,1), which has a connection to (1,1)
  - Move to (2,2), connected to (2,1)
  - Progress to (3,2), connected to (2,2)
  - Continue to (3,3), connected to (3,2)
  - Finally, reach (3,4) from (3,3)

### Final Output:
The coordinates, in the order traversed from origin to target, would be represented as:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>
``` 

This specific solution follows the provided adjacency connections in the maze effectively and efficiently finds the path from the given start to the end point.
