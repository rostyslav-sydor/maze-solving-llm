The maze provided is represented as an adjacency list, detailing the possible movements between cells given as coordinates. The objective is to find a route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,4) navigating through interconnected paths.

To solve this maze, we are logically examining connections between points beginning from the start to find a path to the target. Traverse through the maze is guided by the adjacency list which lays out the direct links between neighboring cells. Given that the maze might have loops or multiple paths leading to the target, a strategy to keep track of visited nodes prevents cyclical pathfinding and ensures the solution is efficient.

By systematically exploring available connections, starting from the designated origin (0,0), and marking cells visited once theyâ€™re explored, we push through the maze while ensuring not to backtrack or revisit nodes, thus handling any possible loops effectively.

The steps involve:
- Starting from (0,0), then checking adjacent nodes.
- Gradually, exploring deeper paths while tracking nodes that have been visited to avoid re-exploration.
- Continue expansion until the target (3,4) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted.

Using this strategic and systematic exploration based on the adjacency list, the following solution to traverse from the entry to the exit point in the maze is deduced:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves navigates through connected paths without revisiting any node more than once and successfully covers the progression from the starting point to the destination described.
