**Step 1**: Identify the starting and ending points of the maze.

* Starting point: (0,0)
* Ending point: (3,4)

**Step 2**: Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the starting point to find the shortest path to the ending point.

**Step 3**: Output the path as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>
