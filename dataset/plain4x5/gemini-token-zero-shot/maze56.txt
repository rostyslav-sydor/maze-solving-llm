We can use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a solution.

We start from the entrance point (0,0) and add it to the stack.
Then we visit the neighbors of the current point and add them to the stack if they are not visited.
We keep doing this until we reach the exit point (3,4).

Here is the path from the entrance to the exit:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) <PATH_END>
```
