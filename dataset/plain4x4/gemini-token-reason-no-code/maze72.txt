**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the <ORIGIN_START> token and follow the adjacency list to find a path to the <TARGET_START> token. In this case, the path is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1).
2. From the <TARGET_START> token, follow the adjacency list to find a path to the <TARGET_END> token. In this case, the path is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).
3. The solution path is the concatenation of the paths from <ORIGIN_START> to <TARGET_START> and from <TARGET_START> to <TARGET_END>. Therefore, the solution path is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

**Output:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
