Here is the solution to the maze represented as a coordinate list:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>


**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the starting point and explore all the options until a dead end is encountered. 
2. Backtrack to the most recent intersection. This will be an unvisited neighbor of the current position 
3. Repeat the above two steps until the target is reached.
