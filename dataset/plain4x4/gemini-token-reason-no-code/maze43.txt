Find the path from <ORIGIN_START> to <TARGET_END> by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph represented by the adjacency list.

During the BFS, maintain a queue of nodes to visit and a set of visited nodes:

1. Start by adding the <ORIGIN_START> node to the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty,
    - Dequeue a node from the queue.
    - If the dequeued node is the <TARGET_END> node, then a path has been found.
    - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node,
        - If the neighbor has not been visited, then
            - Add the neighbor to the queue.
            - Mark the neighbor as visited.
3. If the BFS completes without finding the <TARGET_END> node, then there is no path from <ORIGIN_START> to <TARGET_END>.

To output the path, backtrack from the <TARGET_END> node to the <ORIGIN_START> node by following the parent pointers that were recorded during the BFS.
