- Start from the origin point (0,0) and follow path to reach target point (3,3).
- From origin point (0,0) move right to reach (1,0)
- From point (1,0) move up to reach (1,1)
- From point (1,1) move right to reach (2,1)
- From point (2,1) move down to reach (3,1)
- From point (3,1) move right to reach (3,2)
- From point (3,2) move up to reach (3,3)

Therefore, final path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
