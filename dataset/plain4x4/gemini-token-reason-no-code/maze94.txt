**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and follow the path along the adjacencies.
2. At each intersection, choose the path that leads closer to the target point (3,3).
3. Continue following the path until the target point is reached.

**Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
