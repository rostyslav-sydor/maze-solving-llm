**Reasoning:** 

Starting at the <ORIGIN_START> point, we can see that there are two possible paths:
1. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
2. (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Both paths lead to the <TARGET_END> point. Therefore, either path is a valid solution.

**Output:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
