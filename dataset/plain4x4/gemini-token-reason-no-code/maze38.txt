Depth-first search can be used to find a path between two points in a graph. 

A depth-first search would start at the origin point (0,0) and recursively explore all possible paths until it reaches the target point (3,3). 

The path taken would be recorded as a list of coordinates, starting with the origin point and ending with the target point. 

In this case, the path would be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
