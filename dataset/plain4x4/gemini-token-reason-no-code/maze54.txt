To find a path from the start point to the end point in a maze represented as an adjacency list, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how the algorithm would work:

Start at the start point and mark it as visited.
Get the list of adjacent nodes to the current node.
For each adjacent node, if it has not been visited:
If the adjacent node is the end point, then the path has been found.
Otherwise, recursively call the DFS algorithm on the adjacent node.
If none of the adjacent nodes lead to the end point, then backtrack to the previous node.
Continue this process until either the end point is found or all possible paths have been exhausted.

Here's an example of how the DFS algorithm would find a path in the provided maze:

<ADJLIST_START> (1,1) <--> (2,1) ; (0,1) <--> (0,2) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (3,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (2,0) <--> (2,1) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Start at the start point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
The adjacent nodes to (0,0) are (1,0) and (0,1).
Since (1,0) has not been visited, recursively call the DFS algorithm on (1,0).
The adjacent nodes to (1,0) are (2,0) and (1,1).
Since neither (2,0) nor (1,1) have been visited, recursively call the DFS algorithm on (2,0) and (1,1).
The adjacent node to (2,0) is (2,1). Since (2,1) has been visited before, backtrack to (1,0).
The adjacent node to (1,1) is (1,2). Since (1,2) has not been visited, recursively call the DFS algorithm on (1,2).
The adjacent nodes to (1,2) are (1,3) and (1,1).
Since (1,3) has not been visited, recursively call the DFS algorithm on (1,3).
The adjacent node to (1,3) is (2,3). Since (2,3) has been visited before, backtrack to (1,2).
The adjacent node to (1,2) is (1,1). Since (1,1) has been visited before, backtrack to (1,0).
The adjacent node to (1,0) is (0,0). Since (0,0) has been visited before, backtrack to (0,0).
There are no more paths to explore, so the DFS algorithm stops.

The DFS algorithm did not find a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3).
