1. Starting from the origin (0,0) marked with <ORIGIN_START>, we can follow the adjacency list to reach (0,1) by moving right, (1,1) by moving down, (1,2) by moving right, (1,3) by moving down, (2,3) by moving right, and finally (3,3) by moving down. 
2. This path can be represented as: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
