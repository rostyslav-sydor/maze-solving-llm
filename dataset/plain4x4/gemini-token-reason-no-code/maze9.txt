**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

The maze is a simple grid maze with no loops or cycles. The path from the origin to the target is straightforward and follows a straight line from the origin to the target. The path can be represented as a list of coordinates, with each coordinate representing a cell in the maze. The first coordinate in the list is the origin, and the last coordinate is the target.
