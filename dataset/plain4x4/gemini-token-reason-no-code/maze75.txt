1.  Starting from the entry point, find all adjacent nodes. In this case, we have 3 adjacent nodes, so this is valid.
2. For each adjacent node, mark the node as visited and repeat step 1 until the target node is reached. In this case, we visit node (1,3), then (2,3), then (3,3) which is the target node. So this is valid. 
3. Backtrack from the target node to the entry node by following the visited nodes. The path should be (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0). So this is valid. 
4. Output the path in the requested format.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
