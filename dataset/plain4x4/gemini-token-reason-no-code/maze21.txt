**Reasoning:**
- Starting from the starting point (0,0), the maze is traversed by moving along adjacent coordinates. 
 - This process is continued until the ending point (3,3) is reached. 

**Path:** 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Explanation of the Path**: 
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move down to (1,0).
3. Move right to (2,0).
4. Move up to (1,0) and then right to (1,1) 
5. Continue moving right to reach (1,3).
6. Finally move up and right reach the target (3,3).
