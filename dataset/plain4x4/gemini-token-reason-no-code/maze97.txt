1. Mark the start node as visited and add it to the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
  - Dequeue the first node from the queue.
  - If the dequeued node is the target node, then we have found a path from the start node to the target node. Print the path and stop.
  - Otherwise, for each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node, do the following:
    - Mark the neighbor as visited.
    - Add the neighbor to the queue.
3. If the queue is empty and the target node has not been found, then there is no path from the start node to the target node.

The path can be output as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
