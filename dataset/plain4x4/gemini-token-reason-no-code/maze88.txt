1. **Identify the starting and target nodes.** The starting node is (0,0) and the target node is (3,3).
2. **Create a queue of nodes to visit.** The queue starts with the starting node.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    1. **Dequeue** the first node from the queue.
    2. **Check if the node is the target node.** If it is, then a solution has been found and the path can be outputted.
    3. **Add all of the node's adjacent nodes to the queue.**
4. If the queue is empty and a solution has not been found, then there is no solution to the maze.

In this case, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
