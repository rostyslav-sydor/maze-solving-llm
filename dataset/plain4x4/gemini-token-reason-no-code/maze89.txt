A possible solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. From the starting point at (0,0), the shortest path is to the right towards (1,0).
2. From (1,0), the only available path is to the right again, towards (2,0).
3. From (2,0), the only available path is to the right once more, towards (3,0).
4. From (3,0), the only available path is up, towards (3,1).
5. From (3,1), the only available path is right, towards (3,2).
6. Finally, from (3,2), the only available path is up once more, towards the destination point at (3,3).
