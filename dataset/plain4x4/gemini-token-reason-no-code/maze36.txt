To solve the maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the origin point, we can explore all of its adjacent points, and then explore all of the adjacent points of those points, and so on. We can keep track of the path we have taken by storing the coordinates of each point we visit in a list.

Once we reach the target point, we can stop the BFS and output the path we have taken.

Here is the path for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
