This maze is solved by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the origin point (0,0) and terminating at the target point (3,3). 

The BFS algorithm explores all possible paths from the origin point, expanding the search to neighbouring points in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until the target point is reached.

The path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target point to the origin point, following the path of least distance. 

The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
