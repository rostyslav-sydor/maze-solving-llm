**Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the entry and exit points:** The origin and target tokens indicate the starting and ending points, respectively.
2. **Explore paths from the entry point:** Start at the entry point and explore all adjacent nodes.
3. **Recursively find paths:** For each adjacent node, recursively explore paths from that node.
4. **Check for the target:** If the current node is the target, then the path from the entry point is a solution.
5. **Backtrack:** If the target is not reached, backtrack and explore other paths from the current node or its adjacent nodes.
6. **Construct the solution path:** Once a valid path to the target is found, trace back the steps from the target to the entry point to construct the solution path.

**Solution Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
