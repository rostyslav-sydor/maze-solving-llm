1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Check the adjacency list for all possible moves from the current point.
3. If there is a move that leads to the target point (3,3), then stop and output the path.
4. Otherwise, if there are multiple possible moves, choose one and continue checking the adjacency list from that point.
5. If there are no possible moves from the current point, then backtrack to the previous point and try another move.

The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
