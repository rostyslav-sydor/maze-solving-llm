This maze is solvable using depth first search. We first start from the origin and follow any path until we hit a dead end(a node without any unvisited adjacent nodes). If a dead end is reached, then we back track to the last visited node with unvisited nodes and follow that path until we reach a dead end again. This process is continued until the target node is reached or no more paths can be followed (in which case the maze is unsolvable).

The path from origin to target for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
