1. Start from the origin at (0,0), and find all possible adjacent cells. In this case, there are two adjacent cells, (0,1) and (1,0).

2. Choose one of the adjacent cells (e.g., (0,1)) and visit it. Mark this cell as visited.

3. From the current cell, find all possible adjacent cells that have not been visited. In this case, there is only one adjacent cell, (1,1).

4. Choose one of the adjacent cells (e.g., (1,1)) and visit it. Mark this cell as visited.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the target cell. In this case, the target cell is (3,3).

6. Output the path as a list of coordinates. In this case, the path would be <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
