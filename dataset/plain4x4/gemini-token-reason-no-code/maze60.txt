This maze can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). In this example, we will use DFS.

1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore the adjacent nodes of the current node (0,0) and mark them as visited.
3. Repeat step 2 until the target point (3,3) is reached.
4. Backtrack to the previous node if the target point is not reached.

The path from the origin point to the target point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
