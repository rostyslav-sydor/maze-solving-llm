To find a solution for the maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We start at the origin point and explore all of its adjacent nodes. We continue this process until we reach the target point.

The following is a reasoning for the BFS algorithm:

1. Start at the origin point and add it to a queue.
2. While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue and add it to the visited set.
3. For each adjacent node of the current node, if the adjacent node is not in the visited set and not in the queue, add it to the queue.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target point is reached.

If the BFS algorithm reaches the target point, then there is a solution to the maze. The solution can be found by tracing the path from the origin point to the target point.
