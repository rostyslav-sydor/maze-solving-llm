- Start from <ORIGIN_END> and check its adjacency list for a path to <TARGET_START>, this provides starting path: (3,3) (3,2) (2,2)
- At (2,2) check its adjacency list for a path to <TARGET_START>, this extends the path to:  (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1)
- At (2,1) check its adjacency list for a path to <TARGET_START>, this extends the path to:  (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1)
- Repeat previous step to extend the path until <TARGET_END> is reached, which results in the solution: <PATH_START> (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>
