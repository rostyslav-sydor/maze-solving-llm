To solve a maze represented as adjacency list, we could use Depth First Search(DFS), which is a recursive algorithm. The algorithm starts from the origin point, and for each step, explores all the paths from the current point. If a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the most recent unexplored path and continues the exploration until the target point is reached or no more paths are available.
In this specific case, starting from (0,0), the algorithm could explore paths in the following order: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). Therefore, the path to solve the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
