1. Start from the origin `(0,0)` and traverse the maze by finding all the adjacent nodes.
2. Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid loops.
3. If the current node is the target node `(3,3)`, then we have found a solution.
4. If the current node is not the target node, then we need to backtrack and try other paths.
5. The solution path can be outputted by backtracking from the target node to the origin node.

The solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
