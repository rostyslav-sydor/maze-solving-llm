**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and traverse the maze using the adjacency list.
2. Keep track of the path taken as a list of coordinates.
3. Explore adjacent nodes in a depth-first or breadth-first order until the target point is reached.
4. If a dead end is reached, backtrack to the last intersection and explore a different path.

**Solution Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
