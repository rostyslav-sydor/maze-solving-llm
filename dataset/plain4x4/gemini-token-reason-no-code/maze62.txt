1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Find the adjacent points to the current point and check if any of them are the target point (3,3).
3. If the target point is found, path is complete. Output the list of coordinates from the origin point to the target point.
4. If the target point is not found, visit all the adjacent points and repeat step 2 for each of them.
5. If all the adjacent points have been visited and the target point is not found, there is no path between the origin point and the target point.
