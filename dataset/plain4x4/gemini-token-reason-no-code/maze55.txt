This is a valid maze and has one solution. 

**Reasoning**

**1. Breadth First Search (BFS)** 
- The maze can be traversed using Breadth First Search, starting from the starting point. The algorithm adds all the neighboring cells to a queue by order of distance to the starting point. The algorithm then dequeues the cell at the front of the queue and adds the cell to the traversal. The algorithm repeats this process until the ending point is reached.


**Solution**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
