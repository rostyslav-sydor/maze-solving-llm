**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the `(0,0)` which is the entry point and go to `(0,1)`
2. From `(0,1)` go to `(0,2)`
3. From `(0,2)` go to `(1,2)`
4. From `(1,2)` go to `(2,2)`
5. From `(2,2)` go to `(2,3)`
6. From `(2,3)` go to `(3,3)` which is the exit point

**Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
