We start from the origin and follow the path until we reach the target. 

- Starting from (0,0), we can go to (0,1) and (1,0). Since we want to go to (3,3), we choose to go to (1,0).

- From (1,0), we can go to (1,1) and (2,0). We choose to go to (1,1) because it is closer to (3,3).

- From (1,1), we can go to (1,2) and (2,1). We choose to go to (1,2) because it is closer to (3,3).

- From (1,2), we can go to (1,3) and (2,2). We choose to go to (1,3) because it is closer to (3,3).

- From (1,3), we can go to (2,3) and (3,3). We choose to go to (3,3) because it is the target.

The path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
