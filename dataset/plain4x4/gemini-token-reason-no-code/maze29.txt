1. Find the origin and target coordinates from the adjacency list
2. Perform breadth-first search to find the shortest path between origin and target coordinates
3. Output the shortest path as a list of coordinates

Reasoning:
1. The origin and target coordinates are marked with <ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END> tokens respectively in the adjacency list.
2. Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
3. The output is a list of coordinates that represents the shortest path between the origin and target coordinates.
