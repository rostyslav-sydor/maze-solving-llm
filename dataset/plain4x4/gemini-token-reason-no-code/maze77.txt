The maze can be solved by applying Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) and recording the path taken.

**DFS**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Explore the adjacent nodes in any order.
3. If an adjacent node is the target point (3,3), then the path is found.
4. If not, backtrack to the previous node and explore the next adjacent node.
5. Repeat until the path is found or there are no more unexplored adjacent nodes.

**BFS**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Add all adjacent nodes to a queue.
3. Remove the first node from the queue and explore its adjacent nodes.
4. Add all unexplored adjacent nodes to the queue.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty or the target point (3,3) is found.

**Path**

The path for the given maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
