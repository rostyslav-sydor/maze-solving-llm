First of all, starting from the origin, we move along the path (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) because we have an edge between those nodes.

After reaching (0, 3), we backtrack to (0, 2) and move (0, 2) --> (1, 2) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 1) --> (1, 1) --> (2, 1) because we can traverse along those nodes and edges.

From (2, 1), we backtrack to (1, 1) and move (1, 1) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 3) because we have an edge between those nodes.

From (1, 3), we can reach the target at (3, 3) by (1, 3) --> (2, 3) --> (3, 3).

Therefore, the path is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
