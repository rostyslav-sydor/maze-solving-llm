Here is the solution for the provided maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:

Starting from the origin (0,0), we can move right to (1,0). However, there is no path from (1,0) to the target (3,3). So we move down from (0,0) to (0,1). From (0,1), we can move right to (1,1) and then down to (2,1). From (2,1), we can move right to (3,1) and then down to (3,2). Finally, from (3,2), we can move right to the target (3,3).
