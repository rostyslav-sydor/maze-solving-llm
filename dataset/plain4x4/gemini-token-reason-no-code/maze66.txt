1. The maze is a graph of tokens, so we can use a graph search algorithm to find a path from the start to the end.
2. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find a path.
3. DFS will explore all the paths from the start node until it finds a path to the end node.
4. BFS will explore all the paths from the start node, level by level, until it finds a path to the end node.
5. In this case, we can use either DFS or BFS to find a path.
6. The path from the start to the end is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
