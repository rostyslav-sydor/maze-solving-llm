The maze can be solved by applying breadth first search to the graph. Here is the reasoning:

Starting from the origin, we can reach (1,0) and (0,1). From (1,0), we can reach (2,0) which is a dead end. From (0,1), we can reach (0,0) and (0,2). From (0,0), we can reach (1,0) which we have already visited. From (0,2), we can reach (0,3) and (0,1). 

Continuing in this manner, we can explore all the nodes in the graph and find a path to the target. The path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
