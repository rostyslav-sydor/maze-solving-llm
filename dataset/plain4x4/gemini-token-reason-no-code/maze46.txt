1- We use Depth First Search (DFS) to find the path from the source to the destination in the adjacency list of the maze. DFS starts from the starting point and iterates over neighboring nodes until either the destination node is found or there are no more nodes to iterate over.
2- The solution, which is the list of coordinates of the path from the starting point to the destination point, would be the stack of coordinates visited along the path.
3- The path starts with (<ORIGIN_START> 0,0) and ends with (<TARGET_END> 3,3)
4- The valid solution is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
