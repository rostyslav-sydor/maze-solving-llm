**Step 1: Initialization**

Starting from (0,0), we can see that we have two paths to choose from: (1,0) or (0,1). Let's start with (1,0).

**Step 2: Exploration**

From (1,0), we can move to either (2,0) or (1,1). We'll choose (2,0).
From (2,0), we can move to either (3,0) or (2,1). We'll choose (3,0).
From (3,0), we can move to either (3,1) or (3,2). We'll choose (3,1).
From (3,1), we can move to either (3,2) or (3,3). We'll choose (3,3), which is the target.

**Step 3: Backtracking**

Since we reached the target, we can backtrack and mark the path as we go.

From (3,3), we can move to either (3,2) or (3,1). We came from (3,1), so we'll move to (3,2).
From (3,2), we can move to either (3,1) or (3,0). We came from (3,0), so we'll move to (3,1).
From (3,1), we can move to either (3,0) or (3,2). We came from (3,2), so we'll move to (3,0).
From (3,0), we can move to either (2,0) or (3,1). We came from (3,1), so we'll move to (2,0).
From (2,0), we can move to either (3,0) or (2,1). We came from (3,0), so we'll move to (2,1).
From (2,1), we can move to either (2,0) or (1,1). We came from (2,0), so we'll move to (1,1).
From (1,1), we can move to either (2,1) or (1,2). We came from (2,1), so we'll move to (1,2).
From (1,2), we can move to either (1,1) or (1,3). We came from (1,1), so we'll move to (1,3).
From (1,3), we can move to either (1,2) or (0,3). We came from (1,2), so we'll move to (0,3).

**Output**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
