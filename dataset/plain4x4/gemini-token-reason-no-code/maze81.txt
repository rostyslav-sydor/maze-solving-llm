**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0), and try to reach the target point (3,3).
2. From (0,0), we can move to (0,1) and then to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), we can move to (1,2) but get stuck.
4. Backtrack to (0,1) and try to move to (1,1).
5. From (1,1), we can move to (1,2) and then to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), we can move to (2,3) and then to (3,3).

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
