The maze is represented as a graph, where each node is a coordinate and each edge is a connection between two coordinates. The entry and exit points are marked with specific tokens.

To find a solution, we can use a graph search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). BFS is a good choice for this problem because it guarantees to find the shortest path from the entry to the exit point.

Starting from the entry point, we can traverse the graph by adding each node to a queue and then visiting all of its neighbors. We continue this process until we reach the exit point.

Once we have found the solution, we can output it as a list of coordinates in the order they were visited.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
