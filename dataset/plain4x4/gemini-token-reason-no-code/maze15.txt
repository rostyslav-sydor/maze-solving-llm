To find a solution to the maze, you can use a graph traversal algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). 

Starting from the origin, traverse the graph until you reach the target. The path taken during the traversal will be the solution to the maze.

Here is the solution to the given maze in the format of coordinate list:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
