1. **Find the entry and exit points.** The entry point is marked with the token <ORIGIN_END> and the exit point is marked with the token <TARGET_END>.

2. **Find the path from the entry point to the exit point.** To do this, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

3. **Output the path in the format of coordinate list.** The coordinate list should start with the entry point and end with the exit point. Each coordinate should be in the format (row, column).

**In this case, the solution is:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
