**Reasoning**:

1. Start from the origin, which is (0,0) in this case.
2. Explore the adjacent nodes of the origin, which are (1,0) and (0,1).
3. Since the target is (3,3), continue exploring the nodes by prioritizing the paths that are closer to the target.
4. From (1,0), explore the adjacent nodes (2,0) and (1,1).
5. Since (2,0) is closer to the target than (1,1), explore the adjacent nodes of (2,0), which are (3,0) and (2,1).
6. Continue exploring the adjacent nodes that are closer to the target until the target is reached.
7. The path taken from the origin to the target is the solution to the maze.

**Output**:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
