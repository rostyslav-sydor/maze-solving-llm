We will use a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between the two points in the maze.
The BFS algorithm is an efficient way to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph by exploring adjacent vertices at every level of the search.
Starting with the origin position, we explore all of its adjacent nodes, then the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on, until we reach the target position. 
We keep track of the path taken by storing the coordinates of each node in the path. 
Once the target position is reached, we have a list of coordinates of the shortest path and can output it in the desired format.
