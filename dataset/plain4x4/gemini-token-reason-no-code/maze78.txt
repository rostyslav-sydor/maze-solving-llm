The maze can be solved by starting at the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and following the right-hand rule:

- Step 1: Start at origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and move to the next token that is either (0,1) or (1,0). In this case, let's move to (0,1).
- Step 2: From (0,1), move to the next token that is either (1,1) or (0,0). In this case, let's move to (1,1).
- Step 3: From (1,1), move to the next token that is either (1,2) or (0,1). In this case, let's move to (1,2).
- Step 4: From (1,2), move to the next token that is either (2,2) or (1,1). In this case, let's move to (2,2).
- Step 5: From (2,2), move to the next token that is either (3,2) or (2,1). In this case, let's move to (3,2).
- Step 6: From (3,2), move to the next token that is either (3,3) or (2,2). In this case, let's move to (3,3).
- Step 7: From (3,3), move to the target <TARGET_END> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
