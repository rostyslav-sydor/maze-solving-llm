To solve this maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We start from the origin point (0,0) and add it to a queue. We then loop through the queue, dequeuing each point and adding its unvisited adjacent points to the queue. We continue this process until we reach the target point (3,3).

Once we have found the path from the origin to the target point, we can output it in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. The coordinates in the list should be in the order in which they are visited by the BFS algorithm.

The following is a solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
