This is a 4x4 maze with a valid path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

We can solve this maze using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from the origin, we explore all the possible paths until we reach the target. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different path.

The following is a DFS solution to this maze:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

**Reasoning:** Starting from (0,0), we first move right to (0,1), then up to (1,1), then right to (1,2), then right again to (1,3), then up to (2,3), and finally right to (3,3).

This path successfully navigates the maze from the origin to the target without encountering any dead ends.
