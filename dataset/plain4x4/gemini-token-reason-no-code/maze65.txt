**Reasoning :**

The maze is a simple one, with only one possible path from the starting point to the ending point.

- The starting point is at (0,0) and the ending point is at (3,3).
- We start by moving to the right to (0,1)
- Then move down to (1,1)
- Then move right to (1,2)
- Then move down to (2,2)
- Then move right to (2,3)
- Then move down to (3,3)

**Output :**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
