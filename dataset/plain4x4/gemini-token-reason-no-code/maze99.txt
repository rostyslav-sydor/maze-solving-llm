**Reasoning:**
We can use Depth First Search (DFS) to find a path from the origin to the target in the maze. DFS involves traversing a graph by going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Starting from the origin, we can explore all its adjacent nodes, marking each node as visited to avoid revisiting. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack to the last visited node and try another path.

We continue this process until we reach the target. The path taken from the origin to the target can be represented as a coordinate list, where each coordinate represents a node in the maze.

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
