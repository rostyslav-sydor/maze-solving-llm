First, we identify the origin and target coordinates from the input. In this case, the origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3).

Next, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the origin to the target. We start at the origin and recursively explore all of its adjacent nodes, marking visited nodes to avoid loops. When we reach the target, we have found a path.

The path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target to the origin, following the visited nodes. The path will be a list of coordinates, with the first coordinate being the row and the second coordinate being the column.

In this case, the path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
