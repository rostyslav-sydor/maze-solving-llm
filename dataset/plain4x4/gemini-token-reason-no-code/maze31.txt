In order to find a solution for the maze, we can start at the entry point and explore all possible paths. We keep track of the path we have taken so far, and if we reach the exit point, we have found a solution. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different path.

In this case, we can start at the entry point (0,0) and explore the following paths:

* (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
* (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
* (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
* (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

The first path is the solution to the maze. We can output this path in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
