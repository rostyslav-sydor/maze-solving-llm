**Reasoning:**
- We start at the origin point (0,0).
- We can go right to (1,0)
- We can go up to (1,1)
- We can go right to (1,2)
- We can go up to (1,3)
- We can go left to (0,3)
- We can go down to (0,2)
- We can go right to (1,2)
- We can go up to (1,3)
- We can go right to (2,3)
- We can go down to (3,3)

Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
