To solve this maze, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

**DFS Algorithm:**

1. Start from the origin point (0,0).
2. Visit all unvisited neighbors of the current point.
3. If the current point is the target point (3,3), return the path.
4. Otherwise, backtrack to the previous point and visit another unvisited neighbor.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target point is found or all paths have been explored.

**Reasoning:**

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths from the origin point to the target point. It starts from the origin point and visits all unvisited neighbors. If the current point is the target point, the path is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm backtracks to the previous point and visits another unvisited neighbor. This process is repeated until the target point is found or all paths have been explored.

**Output:**

Following the DFS algorithm, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
