To find a path through the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

DFS is an algorithm that starts at the origin and explores all possible paths until it finds a solution or reaches a dead end. 

At each step, the algorithm chooses an unvisited neighbor of the current node and adds it to the path. 

If the neighbor is the target node, then the algorithm has found a solution. Otherwise, the algorithm backtracks to the previous node and tries a different neighbor.

In this case, the DFS algorithm would start at the origin node (0,0) and explore the following path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path leads to the target node (3,3), so the algorithm has found a solution.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
