To find the solution for the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

Starting from the origin point, we can recursively explore all the adjacent nodes until we reach the target point. 

If we reach a dead end (i.e., there are no more adjacent nodes to explore), we can backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring from there. 

Once we reach the target point, we can trace back the path from the target point to the origin point to obtain the solution.

The solution for the given maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
