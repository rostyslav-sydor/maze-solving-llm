1. Start on the (0,0) coordinate from <ORIGIN_START> token with <PATH_START> to mark start 
2. From (0,0) take a (1,0) direction which is in the direction for <TARGET_START> token
3. Follow direction, passing by (1,0) and (1,1), where at this point is the intersection with 2 adjacent path possibilities and we must choose one: (1,2) or (2,1)
4. For this maze <TARGET_START> token is 1 cell to the right than <ORIGIN_START> which guides the algorithm to choose (1,2) direction
5. Next, continue along the path by following to take directions as much to the right as possible in order to stay closest to <TARGET_START>
6. This gives (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) which is correct path in <PATH_END> token as: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
