**Step 1: Identify the starting and ending points:**

- Starting point: (0, 0)
- Ending point: (3, 3)

**Step 2: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the starting point:**

- Initialize a queue with the starting point (0, 0).
- While the queue is not empty:
  - Dequeue the current point (x, y) from the queue.
  - Check if the current point is the ending point (3, 3). If yes, stop the search.
  - Visit all the adjacent points of the current point. For each adjacent point (x', y'):
    - If the adjacent point has not been visited before, add it to the queue.
    - Keep track of the parent point (x, y) for each visited point.

**Step 3: Trace the path back from the ending point:**

- Starting from the ending point (3, 3), follow the parent points to reconstruct the path back to the starting point (0, 0).

**Result:**

The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
