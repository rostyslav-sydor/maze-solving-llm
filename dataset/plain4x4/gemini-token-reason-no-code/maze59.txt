The goal is to find a path from the origin to the target in the given maze represented as a adjacency list. 

Depth First Search algorithm is suitable for solving this problem, as the algorithm explores possible paths in a recursive manner, finding a path once all possibilities have been explored.

The reasoning behind this algorithm is that it will start at the origin and continue down a path until it reaches the target or until there are no more paths to explore. 

If there are no more paths to explore, the algorithm will backtrack to the previous node and try a different path. 
This process will continue until the target is reached or until all possible paths have been explored. 

Once the target is reached, the path from the origin to the target can be extracted by backtracking from the target to the origin. 
The output will be a list of coordinates representing the path from the origin to the target, formatted as <PATH_START> (row, column) (row, column) ... <PATH_END>.
