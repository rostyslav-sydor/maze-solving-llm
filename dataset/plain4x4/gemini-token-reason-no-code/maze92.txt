**Algorithm:** Depth-First Search

**Steps:**

1. Start from the origin point and mark it as visited.
2. For each adjacent point, if it is not visited and it is not a wall, add it to the stack and mark it as visited.
3. Repeat step 2 until the target point is reached.
4. If the target point is reached, backtrack to the origin point by popping elements from the stack.
5. The path is the sequence of points from the origin point to the target point.

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin point (0,0), the algorithm explores adjacent points and marks them as visited. The algorithm continues until the target point (3,3) is reached. The path is then backtracked by popping elements from the stack, which results in the path <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
