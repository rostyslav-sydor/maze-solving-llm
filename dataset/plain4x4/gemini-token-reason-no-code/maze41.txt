To solve this maze, we can use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

DFS starts at the entry point and explores all possible paths until it reaches the exit point. If a path leads to a dead end, DFS backtracks and tries a different path.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning of the solution:

1. Start at the entry point (0,0).
2. Explore the path (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3).
3. Hit a dead end at (1,3).
4. Backtrack to (1,2) and explore the path (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).
5. Reach the exit point (3,3).

The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
