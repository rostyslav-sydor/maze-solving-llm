To solve this maze, we can use the Depth First Search algorithm: starting from the origin point, we visit each adjacent node in a specific order until we reach the target point.

In this case, we can start from the origin point (0,0) and follow the path (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
