- Starting at the origin point (0,0), follow the path (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3).
- From (1,3), there two possible paths (2,3) -> (3,3) and (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) leading to the target point (3,3).
- Since it does not matter which path is taken, any of the paths can be outputted:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
or
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
