1. Start from the origin `<ORIGIN_START>`.
2. Visit its unvisited neighbors in any order.
3. Repeat step 2 until `<TARGET_END>` is found.
4. Backtrack from the `<TARGET_END>` to `<ORIGIN_END>` by following the shortest path from each node to its `<ORIGIN_END>` visited neighbor.

The solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
