A path from the starting point (0, 0) to the ending point (3, 3) can be found by following the edges of the graph represented by the adjacency list.

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0).
2. From (0, 0), move to (1, 0) by following the edge between (0, 0) and (1, 0).
3. From (1, 0), move to (1, 1) by following the edge between (1, 0) and (1, 1).
4. From (1, 1), move to (2, 1) by following the edge between (1, 1) and (2, 1).
5. From (2, 1), move to (3, 1) by following the edge between (2, 1) and (3, 1).
6. Finally, move from (3, 1) to the target point (3, 3) by following the edge between (3, 1) and (3, 3).

The path can be summarized in the following coordinate list:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
