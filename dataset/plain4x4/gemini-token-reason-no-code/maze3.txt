It is possible to find a solution for the maze by applying iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm, which will start by searching for a path to the target node at depth 1.
If a path is not found, the depth is incremented by 1 and the search is repeated.
This process is continued until a path is found or the maximum depth is reached.

In this case, starting at (0,0) and aiming for (3,3), the path would be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
