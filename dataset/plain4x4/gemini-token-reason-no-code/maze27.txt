In order to solve this maze, we can use Depth-First Search algorithm to traverse the graph starting from the origin point and ending at the target point.

We start from the origin point (0,0) and check its adjacent points, which are (1,0) and (0,1). We can choose to go either way, but let's choose (1,0).

From (1,0) we can go to (2,0) or (1,1). Let's choose (1,1).

From (1,1) we can go to (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), or (3,1). Let's choose (1,2).

From (1,2) we can go to (0,2), (2,2), or (1,3). Let's choose (1,3).

From (1,3) we can go to (1,2) or (0,3). Let's choose (1,2).

From (1,2) we can go to (1,1), (1,3), or (2,2). Let's choose (1,1).

From (1,1) we can go to (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), or (3,1). Let's choose (2,1).

From (2,1) we can go to (3,1), (1,1), or (2,2). Let's choose (3,1).

From (3,1) we can go to (3,2) or (3,0). Let's choose (3,2).

From (3,2) we can go to (2,2), (3,1), or (3,3). Let's choose (3,3), which is the target point.

Therefore, the path from the origin point to the target point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
