Reasoning:

1. Start at the starting point (0,0) and traverse the maze using depth-first search or breadth-first search.

2. Mark nodes as you visit to avoid loops.

3. Continue searching until you reach the goal (3,3). 

4. The path will be the sequence of nodes that lead from starting point to the destination point.
5. The path can be represented as a list of coordinates in order of traversal from (0,0) to (3,3).

Output:

 <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
