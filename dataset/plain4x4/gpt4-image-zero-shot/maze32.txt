To solve the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), we can follow a path that navigates through the open passages, avoiding walls. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Start at the entry point (0,0).
2. Move horizontally to the right to (0,1) as there is no wall blocking this movement.
3. From (0,1), move further right to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), you can move downwards to (1,2) because moving right to (0,3) is blocked by a wall.
5. From (1,2), continue moving downward to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), proceed to (3,2) because the path to the right (2,3) is obstructed by a wall.
7. Finally, from (3,2), move to the right to reach the exit point at (3,3).

The complete path from start to finish, avoiding walls and following viable routes, is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequence of moves provides a clear path from the entry to the exit without backtracking or hitting any dead ends.
