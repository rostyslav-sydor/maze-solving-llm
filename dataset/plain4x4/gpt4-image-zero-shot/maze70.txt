To solve the maze:

1. Start at the entrance point (0,0).
2. Move directly right to (0,1) since there are no walls blocking the path.
3. Continue moving right to (0,2) and (0,3) as the path is clear.
4. At (0,3), one must move down to (1,3) because any movement left or right is blocked.
5. From (1,3), continue down to (2,3) and (3,3) where no walls hinder downward movement.

Thus, the path from the entry to the exit is a straight line right until the last column and then straight down to the bottom right corner.

Formatted path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
