Starting at the entry point (0,0), the path needs to find a way to the exit point at (3,3) in this grid-type maze.

1. From the start at (0,0), the only option is to move right to (0,1) because the downward path is blocked by a wall.
2. At (0,1), again, the only option without hitting a wall is to continue right to (0,2).
3. At (0,2), moving right to (0,3) is still unobstructed.
4. From (0,3), moving down to (1,3) is the next valid step, since moving further right is out of the maze's bounds and down does not hit a wall.
5. At (1,3), continue moving down to (2,3) because moving left would revisit visited cells.
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is the exit point.

Path solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves sequentially through available openings, making right or downward moves when possible, guided by the maze's boundaries and walls.
