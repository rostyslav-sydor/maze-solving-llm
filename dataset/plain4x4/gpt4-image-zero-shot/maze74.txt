To solve the maze, we start from the entry point at coordinate (0,0) and aim to reach the exit point at (3,3) by navigating through the open paths, avoiding the walls.

1. Begin at (0,0), the only option is moving downward as right is blocked.
2. Move to (1,0), from here, we can only continue moving downward.
3. Arrive at (2,0), with the next step still moving downward.
4. At (3,0), our path to the right is now open, move to (3,1).
5. From (3,1), continue right to (3,2).
6. Finally from (3,2), move to the exit at (3,3).

Thus, the complete path from entrance to exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
