To solve the maze, we begin at the entry point (0,0) and seek the exit at (3,3). We navigate by moving through cells that are not separated by a wall.

1. Starting at (0,0), the next possible move without encountering a wall is downwards to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move right to (1,1) and continue to (1,2).
3. At (1,2), move downwards to (2,2) since moving right to (1,3) is blocked.
4. Go downwards again from (2,2) to (3,2).
5. Finally, move right from (3,2) to (3,3) where the exit is located.

Thus, the solution path is structured with a series of row and column shifts that avoid walls, as outlined.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
