To find the solution for this maze, let’s follow the possible path starting from the entry point (0,0) and aiming to reach the exit at (3,3) while avoiding the walls.

1. Begin at (0,0). Move right to (0,1), and (0,2) as there are no walls obstructing these cells to the right.
   
2. From (0,2), move down to (1,2). Continue moving down to (2,2), due to an unobstructed path vertically.

3. Move left from (2,2) to (2,1). Continue moving left to (2,0) where again, there are no walls blocking these cells horizontally.

4. Move down from (2,0) to (3,0).

5. From (3,0), now move right to (3,1), and continue to (3,2). From here, proceed to the exit (3,3).

This path successfully navigates around walls:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

Each move was made by checking the availability of adjacent cells free from walls, moving horizontally or vertically as needed to proceed towards the exit.
