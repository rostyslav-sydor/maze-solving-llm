To solve the maze, we'll analyze the paths that can be taken without crossing any thick black lines which represent walls.

1. Starting at the entry point (0,0), we observe that we can only move to the right, as moving down is blocked by a wall.
2. From (0,1), rightward movement to (0,2) is open.
3. From (0,2), we must move down to (1,2) because movement to the right is blocked by a wall.
4. From (1,2), we can move further right to (1,3).
5. Now at (1,3), we go down to (2,3).
6. Finally at (2,3), move down to the exit point at (3,3).

Put into coordinates as per your requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
