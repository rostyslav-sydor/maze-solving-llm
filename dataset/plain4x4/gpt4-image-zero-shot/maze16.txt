To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (3,3), analyze the paths available at each position, avoiding walls.

1. Start at (0,0). The only move leading from this point is to (0,1) because moving downwards is blocked by a wall.
2. From (0,1), there aren't any walls blocking the move to the right, so move to (0,2).
3. Then continue to (0,3) as it's not obstructed.
4. At (0,3), the path downwards is clear, so proceed to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), go directly down without any obstruction to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is the exit point of the maze.

Summarizing the successful path:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

This path avoids all walls and reaches the exit successfully.
