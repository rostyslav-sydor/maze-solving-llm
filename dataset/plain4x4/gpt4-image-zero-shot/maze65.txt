To solve the maze, we'll start from the initial coordinate (0,0) and trace a path to the final coordinate (3,3) where the exit is located.

1. Starting at (0,0), could move directly to the right to (0,1), since there are no walls blocking that path.
2. From (0,1), continue moving to the right to (0,2) as there are no walls directly between these points.
3. From (0,2), move further right to (0,3). Again, there is no wall directly blocking the eastward movement.
4. Now at (0,3), move downward to (1,3) as there's no wall blocking the southward path.
5. From (1,3), continue downward to (2,3), as the path remains unblocked.
6. From (2,3), can either continue toward (3,3) to the bottom or turn left. Both are open, but since the goal is at (3,3), we move down to (3,3).

Thus, the solution path in coordinate form from entry to exit would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This pathway avoids all walls and delivers at the exit point (3,3) effectively.
