Starting at entry point (0,0), I observe there are no blocking walls immediately to the right or downwards from this point. Proceeding with a possible route:

1. From (0,0), move right to (0,1) - no wall obstructs this move.
2. Continue moving right to (0,2) - still no wall.
3. Move down to (1,2).
4. Continue downward to (2,2).
5. Move left to (2,1).
6. Proceed left to (2,0).
7. Move down to (3,0).
8. Continue right to (3,1).
9. Move right to (3,2).
10. Finally, move right to (3,3) - reach exit.

This pathway successfully navigates the maze from the entrance to the exit without crossing any walls.

Formatted solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
