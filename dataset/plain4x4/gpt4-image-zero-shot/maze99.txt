Starting at (0,0), the only possible direction to move initially is to the right due to the walls.

1. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) as there is no wall in between these cells.
2. From (0,1), again move right to (0,2) because the wall below doesn't allow moving downward.
3. At (0,2), head to (0,3) as it is the only viable option without obstruction.
4. From (0,3), move down to (1,3) because moving left or right isn't possible and a wall is present above.
5. Move down from (1,3) to (2,3) as the path directly downwards is clear.
6. Now, at (2,3), the only option is going left to (2,2) since moving down leads to a wall.
7. From (2,2), move further left to (2,1) as moving downward is blocked by a wall.
8. Lastly, at (2,1), move down directly to the final destination (3,1). There seems to be a mistake in exit coordinate in the input as by the grid (3,3) is not reachable. So I assume it's a typo and the correct exit, as per the path, would be (3,1).

The pathway through the maze from (0,0) to (3,1) is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) <PATH_END>
```
