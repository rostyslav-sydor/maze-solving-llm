To solve the maze, start at the entry point (0,0) and find a path to the exit point at (3,3). Analyzing the maze:

1. Begin at (0,0), where the only option is to move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), continue right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
4. At (1,2), the path leads right to (1,3).
5. Moving down from (1,3), reach (2,3).
6. Continue downward from (2,3) to reach the exit at (3,3).

Thus, the sequence of movements through the maze follows this path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

Each step is chosen based on the available paths and avoiding walls, aiming to progress towards the bottom right corner of the maze, which is the designated exit.
