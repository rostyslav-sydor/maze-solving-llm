To solve the maze, I will analyze the paths blocked by walls and identify navigable routes from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3). Here's the logical pathway:

1. Starting from (0,0), move right to (0,1) as the path to the bottom (1,0) is blocked.
2. Continue right to (0,2) since the path downwards to (1,2) is blocked by a wall.
3. Move further right to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move downwards to (1,3) since the left path is blocked.
5. Continue down to (2,3), the only option since it’s blocked to the left.
6. Move further down to (3,3), which is the exit.

Visualizing this trajectory provides a clear continuous path without barriers in the specified movements. Here’s the formatted solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
