The maze's possible paths can be deduced by following routes that are not blocked by the thick black lines (walls).

Starting from the entry point at (0,0), observe the navigable openings:
1. From (0,0), we move to (1,0) as the path downwards is clear.
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0) as the path further downwards is still clear.
3. From (2,0), move to (3,0) since the path continues downward without a blockage.
4. At (3,0), proceed right to (3,1) - as the movement to the right is possible.
5. From (3,1), move further right to (3,2), continuing eastward.
6. Lastly, from (3,2) move right to the exit point at (3,3).

These steps cover permissible movements between cells without crossing any walls, leading from the entry to the exit point of the maze.

Encapsulating this path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
