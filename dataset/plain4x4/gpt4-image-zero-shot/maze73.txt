To solve the maze, we will trace a path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (3,3) by navigating through open pathways, avoiding walls.

1. Start at point (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1), as going downward or right is blocked by walls.
3. Continue to (0,2), (0,3) straightforwardly, since moving downwards is blocked by a wall.
4. From (0,3), the path can now move downwards to (1,3), as heading further right is impossible.
5. Proceed further down to (2,3) and (3,3).

By moving rightwards first while ascending and then descending downwards from (0,3) to (3,3), we utilize the available open passages and avoid walls to reach the exit successfully.
