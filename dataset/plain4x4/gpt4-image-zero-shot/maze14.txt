Upon examining the maze, we start at the entrance point (0,0). Here's the logical step-by-step approach to navigate the maze:

1. From the start (0,0), move right to (0,1), as moving down leads to a dead-end.
2. Continue right to (0,2) and then (0,3), because there are no walls obstructing this path.
3. From (0,3), move down to (1,3). Moving to the left or right is not possible as this leads to either outside of the grid or the path is blocked.
4. From (1,3), continue moving down all the way to (3,3) as there is a clear path free of walls. 

This approach avoids all walls and leads directly to the exit at (3,3).
