To solve this maze, we'll start at (0,0) and make our way to (3,3) by moving through open paths avoiding the walls.

1. Start from (0,0). The only open path is to the right, to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), the path leads down to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), continue moving down to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move right to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), go down to (3,3) which is the exit.

Now, compiling these moves into the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

These steps successfully navigate the maze from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3) without crossing any walls. Each move is chosen based on available paths free of barriers, ensuring connectivity from start to finish.
