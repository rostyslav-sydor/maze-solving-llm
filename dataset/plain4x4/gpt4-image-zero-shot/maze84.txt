To solve this maze, let's analyze the path from the entry point at (0, 0) to the exit point at (3, 3) while avoiding the walls.

Starting at (0,0), the only open path is down to (1,0). From (1,0), again you can only go down to (2,0). At (2,0), you can progress down to (3,0), then move right to (3,1), (3,2), and finally reach (3,3).

This entire path avoids walls and allows movement between cells that are adjacent and not separated by a wall.

Therefore, the path from the entrance at (0, 0) to the exit at (3, 3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
