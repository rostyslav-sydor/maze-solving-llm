To solve the maze, we start at (0,0) and aim to reach (3,3) by navigating through open paths without crossing any walls. 

1. We begin at (0,0) and observe there's no wall directly below, so we move down to (1,0).
2. At (1,0), no wall blocks the right movement; thus, move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), the right-hand side to (1,2) is open, so the next step takes us to (1,2).
4. At (1,2), moving right to (1,3) is possible as there is no obstructing wall.
5. At (1,3), there's an open path downward to (2,3).
6. Then from (2,3), noting there's no wall directly downward, proceed to (3,3) which is the exit point.

Thus, the path solution for the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
