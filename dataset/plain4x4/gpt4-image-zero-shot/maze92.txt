To solve the maze provided, let's start from the entry point at (0,0) and determine a path to the exit point at (3,3), analyzing cell accessibility step by step:

1. From cell (0,0), you can move right to (0,1) since there’s no wall blocking the horizontal move.
2. From (0,1), move further right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move right to (0,3), reaching the extreme right of the grid at the top.
4. From (0,3), move down to (1,3), no walls block the vertical movement.
5. From (1,3), continue moving down to (2,3) as paths are clear.
6. From (2,3), move down again to (3,3), the exit of the maze.

Every move here adheres to typical maze-solving strategies of following open paths in a preferential direction, in this case to the right or downwards when possible, because of the given entry and exit positions. This path strategy avoids all walls while keeping movements legal and direct.
