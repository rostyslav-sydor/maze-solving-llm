To solve the maze, we start from the entry point (0,0) and attempt to find a path to the exit point (3,3) by navigating through the cells without crossing the walls.

1. Begin at (0,0): Only option is to move right to (0,1).
2. At (0,1), continue moving right to (0,2).
3. At (0,2), only possible move is down to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move right to (1,3).
5. Then move down from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. Continue moving down from (2,3) to the final exit at (3,3).

Combining all these steps into the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
