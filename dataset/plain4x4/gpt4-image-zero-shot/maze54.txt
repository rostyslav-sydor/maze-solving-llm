To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (3,3), start by analyzing the accessible paths considering the walls.

From the starting point (0,0), you can move down to (1,0). Moving right is blocked by a wall. 
Next, from (1,0), continue down to (2,0). There's a wall blocking the right side at (1,0).
Now, from (2,0), move right to (2,1) and (2,2) because there's no wall blocking these moves.
From (2,2) move down to (3,2). Moving right from (2,2) is blocked, so the only option is to move down.
Lastly, from (3,2) move right to the exit point at (3,3). No interruption by walls for this final segment.

Formatted path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
