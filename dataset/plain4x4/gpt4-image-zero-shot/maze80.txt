To solve the maze starting at (0,0) and ending at (3,3), we follow a path considering open passages and avoiding walls.

1. From (0,0), move east to (0,1), as there's no wall blocking the path.
2. From (0,1), proceed directly to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), only feasible move without intersecting walls is south to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), continue south to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), go west to (2,1) because there's no wall.
6. From (2,1), again move west to (2,0).
7. Then, head south from (2,0) to (3,0), directed by the lack of walls.
8. Lastly, from (3,0), move east through clear paths to (3,1), (3,2), and ultimately (3,3) for the exit.

Thus, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
