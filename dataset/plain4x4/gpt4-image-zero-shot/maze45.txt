To solve the maze, I will trace a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3) while navigating around the walls marked by thick black lines.

1. Start at (0,0). You can move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), continue to the right to (0,2).
3. At (0,2), continue moving right to reach (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move down to (1,3).
5. Continue moving down from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), keep moving downward to (3,3) which is the exit.

Thus, the solution path through the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
