To solve this maze, start from the entry point at (0,0), and let's analyze the paths without hitting any walls.

1. From (0,0), you can only go to (1,0) as all other directions are blocked by walls.
2. From (1,0), moving to (2,0) is the only option without a wall.
3. From (2,0), you can either go to (3,0) or back to (1,0). Going to (3,0) advances closer to the goal.
4. From (3,0), the only movement without a wall is to (3,1).
5. From (3,1), move to (3,2) since it’s the only way without hitting a wall.
6. Proceed from (3,2) to the exit at (3,3).

Thus, the path through the maze from (0,0) to (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
