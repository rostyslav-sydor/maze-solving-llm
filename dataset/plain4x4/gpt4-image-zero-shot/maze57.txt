To solve the maze, start from the entry point (0,0) and move towards the exit point (3,3) by navigating through the open paths while avoiding the walls.

1. Begin at (0,0). Since moving right to (0,1) is not obstructed, proceed in that direction.
2. From (0,1), we can only move right again to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2) as moving right to (0,3) or left to (0,1) is blocked by walls.
4. At (1,2), the only option is to move down further to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), moving right to (2,3) is clear.
6. Now at (2,3), since a vertical move to (3,3) encounters no walls, proceed down to reach the exit.

Thus, the solution path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (3,3) is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. 

This path avoids all walls and follows the open corridors of the maze directly to the exit.
