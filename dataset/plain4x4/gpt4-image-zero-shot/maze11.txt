To solve this maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), we'll analyze the image to determine viable paths stepping through the grid where walls are absent:

1. Start at the entrance (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1) since moving down is blocked.
3. Move right to (0,2) since moving down is still blocked.
4. Move right to (0,3) since moving down is blocked.
5. Now, move down to (1,3).
6. Continue moving down to (2,3).
7. Then, move down to (3,3), the exit point.

Thus, the solution path, in coordinate format within the specified tokens is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path follows the open corridors avoiding any walls, and effectively reaches the exit point from the starting point.
