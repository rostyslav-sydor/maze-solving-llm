To solve the maze, starting from entry point (0,0) and aiming to reach the exit at (3,3):

1. Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1) as there is no wall blocking the path.
2. From (0,1), move right again to (0,2), continuing in an open path.
3. At (0,2), move right once more to (0,3), still following an open pathway.
4. From (0,3), you can move downward to (1,3). The right side is blocked by a boundary.
5. Continue moving down from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. At (2,3), proceed to move down to (3,3), which is the exit of the maze.

Summarizing the successful path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence follows the open corridors of the maze without crossing any walls, leading directly from the entrance to the exit.
