To solve the maze, we can analyze the layout and move step-by-step through traversable paths from the start point (0,0) to the exit (3,3). We'll ensure that moves are only made into adjacent open cells (not blocked by walls) and use the image's given row (y) and column (x) coordinates.

1. Begin at the start point (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1) as there is no wall blocking this move.
3. Continue moving right from (0,1) to (0,2) and then from (0,2) to (0,3), since the path along the top row is clear.
4. From (0,3), move down to (1,3). 
5. From (1,3), continue moving downward to (2,3), as there is no wall in between these cells within the rightmost column.
6. Move from (2,3) to the exit at (3,3).

Here is the resulting path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This solution is derived after observing clear paths between indicated coordinates without the impedance of marked walls.
