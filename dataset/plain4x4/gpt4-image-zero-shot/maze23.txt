To solve the maze starting from the entry point at (0,0) and reaching the exit at (3,3), we observe the pathways available by following the possible passages without crossing any thick black lines indicating walls:

1. Starting at (0,0), move east to (0,1) because moving south is blocked by a wall.
2. Continue east from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move south to (1,2) because moving east is blocked by a wall.
4. From (1,2) continue moving south to (2,2) since other directions are blocked.
5. Move east from (2,2) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), head south to reach the exit at (3,3).

Thus, the path from the entry to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
