To solve the maze, we start from the entry point at (0,0) and proceed to find a path that leads to the exit at (3,3) without crossing any walls. Observing the maze, the steps can be determined as follows:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1) as moving down is blocked by a wall.
3. Continue right to (0,2) and (0,3) since the path is clear.
4. The path down at (0,3) is blocked, so backtrack slightly and then proceed down from (0,2) to (1,2).
5. Move down again from (1,2) to (2,2).
6. There are walls preventing rightward and downward movement from (2,2), hence move left to (2,1).
7. From (2,1), move down to (3,1).
8. Finally, move right from (3,1) to (3,2) and then to (3,3) which is the exit.

So the solution to the maze, following the path that avoids all walls, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
