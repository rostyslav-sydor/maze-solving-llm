To solve the maze, we can start at the entry point (0,0) and trace a path to the exit point (3,3) while avoiding walls:

1. Start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1) since the path is clear.
2. Move from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), you can move to (0,3).
4. No rightward or downward movement possible from (0,3) due to walls, so move down from (0,3) to (1,3).
5. Continue moving downwards from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move right to (2,4) ï¿½ Note: Assuming there is a mistake in stating the exit as (3,3), the location should be (2,4) based on conventional matriculation limits (0-3 for a 4x4 grid).
7. The final step moves right from (2,4) to (3,4).

Here's the complete path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

Please double-check the layout or boundaries, as it seems the maze surpasses typical grid constraints or there's an error in exit location description.
