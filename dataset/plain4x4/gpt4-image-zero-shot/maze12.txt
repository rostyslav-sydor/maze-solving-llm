To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), observe where the walls are and determine a valid path that does not cross any walls.

Starting from (0,0):
1. Move to (0,1) as moving right does not cross any walls.
2. Continue to (0,2), no walls block the rightward movement.
3. Move down to (1,2) from (0,2) as there is no wall blocking the downward path.
4. Proceed to the right to (1,3) from (1,2).
5. Move downward to (2,3), following the clear path.
6. Continue downward to (3,3) as the path directly below is unobstructed.

Thus, the path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path effectively navigates through the accessible cells without crossing any of the represented black line walls.
