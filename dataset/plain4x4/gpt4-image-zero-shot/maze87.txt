To solve the maze from the starting point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), we begin from the entry and assess the options at each point based on the openings (not blocked by walls) on the grid.

- Start at (0,0). The only open path is to move right to (0,1).
- From (0,1), move further right to (0,2).
- From (0,2), you can only move down to (1,2).
- From (1,2), continue downwards to (2,2).
- From (2,2), the only path forward is to move down to (2,3) and then to (3,3) where the exit is located.

Hence, the path through the maze from (0,0) to (3,3) avoiding all walls and respecting the boundaries for openings is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
