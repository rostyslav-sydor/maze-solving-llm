To solve the maze given the entry point (0,0) and the exit point (3,3), let’s follow a feasible path through the maze analyzing from the entry:

1. Starting at (0,0), move to the right as moving down is blocked by a wall.
2. From (0,1), continue right to (0,2) as down is still not viable because of the wall.
3. Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) since the right is blocked by a wall.
4. Continue down from (1,2) to (2,2) as moving further right is blocked.
5. Again move further down from (2,2) to (3,2).
6. Finally, move right from (3,2) to (3,3) which is the exit.

Formatted path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
