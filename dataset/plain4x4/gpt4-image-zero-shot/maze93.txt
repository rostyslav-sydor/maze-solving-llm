We start at (0,0). Since there is a wall immediately to the right, the only direction we can move is down to (1,0). From (1,0), the available move is to the right to (1,1), following which we move down to (2,1).

At (2,1), we can go right to (2,2). Since the path directly down from (2,2) is blocked by a wall, the next move is to the right to (2,3), and then we proceed upwards to (1,3).

Continuing from (1,3), the path to the left is blocked, but we can go up to (0,3). Finally, the path to the right from (0,3) to (0,4) is open but it's outside the maze boundary. We’ll proceed down from (0,3) to (1,3) (revisiting this cell because there's no other non-wall passage), and then directly to the right from (1,3) to (2,3), then (3,3) which is our designated exit location.

Thus, the path solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
