To solve the maze, we start from the entry point at (0,0). The viable path follows where there are no walls blocking the way.

1. Starting at (0,0), move to (1,0) since moving right is blocked by a wall.
2. From (1,0), move to (1,1) since the path forward (going down to (2,0)) is blocked.
3. From (1,1), move to (1,2) which is open directly to the right.
4. From (1,2), move to (1,3) which is also open to the right.
5. From (1,3), since moving further right is outside the boundaries, move down to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), continue to (3,3), which is the exit point without any obstruction.

So the path from the entry to the exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
