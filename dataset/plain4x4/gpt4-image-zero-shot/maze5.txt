Starting from the entry point at (0,0), we observe that movement to the right (0,1) is open. Continuing down this path, we can move:

1. From (0,1) to (0,2). (Right move)
2. From (0,2) to (0,3). (Right move)
3. Then, from (0,3) to (1,3). (Down move)
4. From (1,3) to (2,3). (Down move)
5. From (2,3) to (3,3) which is the exit point. (Down move)

Here, the path avoids any walls (denoted by the thick black lines) and moves only through open passages. Each move was chosen based on the possible paths available at each coordinate without retracing steps unless required by a dead end, which did not occur in this scenario.
