To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (3,3), follow these steps based on the maze layout:

1. Start at (0,0). You can move downwards as the adjacent right cell (0,1) has a wall.
2. Move to (1,0). Proceed to the right as the path directly below (2,0) is blocked by a wall.
3. Move to (2,0). Here, you again move to the right to (2,1) since downward movement is blocked.
4. From (2,1), move downward to (3,1) as the path to the right (2,2) has a wall.
5. Move right to (3,2), and then finally move right to (3,3).

Hence, your complete path in coordinate format would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
