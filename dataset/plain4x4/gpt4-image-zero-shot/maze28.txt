To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (3,3) while observing the wall placements:

1. Start at (0,0). There is a clear path downward along the first column.
2. Move from (0,0) downwards, as the column walls block movement to the right from rows 0 to 2 at column 0.
3. From (0,0), go to (1,0).
4. Continue from (1,0) to (2,0).
5. At (2,0), movement to the right is possible (since no walls block it), so move to (2,1).
6. From (2,1) move to (2,2). Avoid moving to (2,3) because a wall blocks access.
7. From (2,2), you can move down to (3,2) since it's clear.
8. Then from (3,2), move right to the exit at (3,3).

Final path from entry to exit is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
