To solve the maze starting at (0,0) and finishing at (3,3), let's trace a path avoiding the walls marked by thick black lines:

1. From (0,0) move right to (0,1), (0,2), and then (0,3), since there are no horizontal walls blocking this route in the top row.
2. From (0,3) move down to (1,3) and (2,3) because there are no vertical walls blocking the way along column 3 until row 2.
3. From (2,3), move down to (3,3) which is the exit point.

Combining all moves, the path through the maze with the coordinates is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
