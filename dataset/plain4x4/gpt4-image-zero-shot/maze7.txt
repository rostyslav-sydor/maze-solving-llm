To solve the maze, we start at (0,0) and look for a path leading to (3,3), considering the positions of the walls.

1. Starting at (0,0), we can't move to the left or up as these are outside the maze boundaries. Moving right to (0,1) is blocked by a wall, but we can move down to (1,0).

2. From (1,0), we can only move right to (1,1) because moving down or left is blocked (left returns us to the start, and down leads to a blocked path).

3. Moving right from (1,1) is allowed; hence, we proceed to (1,2).

4. From (1,2), we again move right to (1,3) as it’s the only available path without a wall.

5. At (1,3), the only movement without a wall is down to (2,3).

6. From (2,3), continue moving down to (3,3) which is the exit.

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) avoiding walls is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
