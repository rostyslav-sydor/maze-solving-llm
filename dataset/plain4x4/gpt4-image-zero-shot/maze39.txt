To solve the maze, starting from the entry point (0,0), we should identify a path avoiding the walls, and where possible, move directly towards the exit (3,3):

1. **Start at (0,0).** This cell is open, so we can begin here.
2. **Move to (1,0).** The path directly downward is open.
3. **Move to (2,0).** Continue downward, still open.
4. **Move to (3,0).** Directly downward again, the path is clear.
5. **Move to (3,1).** Now move right as moving downward or upward is blocked.
6. **Move to (3,2).** Continue right, toward the exit.
7. **Move to (3,3).** Final move right to the exit point.

Thus, the path from entry to exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path follows a clear route from the bottom left to bottom right of the maze, avoiding all walls.
