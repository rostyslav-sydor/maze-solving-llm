To solve the maze from (0,0) to (3,3), I will analyze the path visually by tracing possible routes that do not cross the thick black lines representing walls.

1. Beginning at (0,0), we can move downward to (1,0) as no wall blocks this move.
2. From (1,0), move right to (1,1). 
3. From (1,1), move right further to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move right again to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), there are no further possible moves to the right or upward due to the walls. Hence, we go down to (2,3).
6. Continue moving down from (2,3) to (3,3).

Conclusively, the path for escaping the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
