To solve this maze, let's analyze the structure step-by-step:

1. Starting from the entry point at (0,0), you can move to the right because there is no wall blocking the path to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move right again to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move down again to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move down once more to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), move right to the exit at (3,3).

In summary, the path to solve the maze starting from (0,0) and ending at (3,3) avoids any walls and successfully navigates to the exit by moving strategically right when possible and down where applicable.

The sequence of moves is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
