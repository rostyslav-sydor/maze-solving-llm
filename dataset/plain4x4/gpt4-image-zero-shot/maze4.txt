To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), observe and navigate through the paths available:

1. Start at (0,0). There's no wall on the southern boundary, so move down to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move east to (1,1) as the path is open.
3. Continue east to (1,2) due to no wall blocking.
4. Proceed east to (1,3) since the path is clear.
5. At (1,3), no wall blocks the southern direction, so move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), the next step without a wall is south to (3,3), reaching the exit point.

Here is the solution path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
