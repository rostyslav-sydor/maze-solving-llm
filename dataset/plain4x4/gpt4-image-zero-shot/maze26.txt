To solve this maze and find a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), let's analyze and navigate through the grid:

1. Start at (0,0). The only available move is to go down to (1,0) since the right is blocked.
2. At (1,0), we can only continue downwards to (2,0) because the right is blocked.
3. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is the only option, as moving down leads to a dead end.
4. At (2,1), proceed right to (2,2) since the path upwards to (1,1) is blocked.
5. From (2,2), the path forward is to move to (2,3) as the way down to (3,2) is blocked.
6. At (2,3), move upwards to (1,3) because moving right is a dead end.
7. From (1,3), go upwards to (0,3).
8. Finally, from (0,3), move right to (0,2) and then further right to (0,1) to get to the very adjacent point to the start, and then reach the exit at (3,3) by moving downward all the way through column 3.

Resulting path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
