To solve the maze, let's trace a path from the starting point at (0,0) to the finishing point at (3,3) while avoiding thick black lines which represent walls.

1. Start at (0,0). Moving right or down is possible, the former being blocked by a wall at (0,1). Hence, move down to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move right to (1,1).
3. Continue moving right to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), progress further right to (1,3).
5. At (1,3), the only feasible direction without a wall is down to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move down to (3,3), which is the exit point.

The path consists of coherent forward or downward movements without turning back or encountering walls directly in the path.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
