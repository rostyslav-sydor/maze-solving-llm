To solve the maze, I will analyze the paths available without encountering any walls. The maze begins at (0,0) and ends at (3,3):

1. Starting at (0,0), the only open path is moving right to (0,1) as moving downwards is blocked.
2. From (0,1), move further right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), continue right to (0,3) as there are no downward openings until this point.
4. From (0,3), the only available move is down to (1,3) because moving left or right is not possible, and the only available downward path opens here.
5. At (1,3), moving further down to (2,3) is possible.
6. Finally, from (2,3), move down to (3,3), which is the exit of the maze.

Here is the successful path from entry to exit:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
