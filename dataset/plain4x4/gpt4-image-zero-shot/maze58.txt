To navigate this maze from entry (0,0) to exit (3,3), we observe the following possible paths without crossing any thick black walls, which represent blockages:

1. Starting from (0,0), move horizontally to the right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), vertical movements are blocked by a wall to the south, so continue right to (0,2) and then to (0,3).
3. At (0,3), you're at the far right of the first row, move down to (1,3), as moving left or further right is blocked.
4. From (1,3), continue down to (2,3).
5. At (2,3), the only unblocked movement direction is downward. Therefore, move down to the last row, reaching (3,3).

This path keeps you within the open corridors, skirting around the walls that obstruct other potential directions. Here’s the sequence:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
