To solve the maze, start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate using available paths (where no walls block the way) to reach the exit point at (3,3).

1. Start at (0,0) - Movement allowed right to (0,1) since no wall blocks horizontally.
2. Move right to (0,1) - Movement allowed downwards to (1,1) since no wall blocks vertically.
3. Move down to (1,1) - Continue moving right to (1,2) and then (1,3) as the horizontal path is free.
4. At (1,3) - The path right is blocked so move downward to (2,3).
5. Move down to (2,3) - Continue down to (3,3), as the vertical path is free and it leads directly to the exit point.

Thus, the path to exit the maze from point (0,0) to point (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
