To solve the maze, let's analyze the grid considering the walls that block paths and find a route from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

1. Start at (0,0). Moving right to (0,1) is possible since there is no wall.
2. Continue from (0,1) to (0,2), and then (0,3), moving right along the top row which is all open.
3. From (0,3), move down to (1,3) as the path directly downwards is clear.
4. But, there's a wall at (1,3) preventing further movement down or to the left. So, move down from (1,3) to (2,3), and then proceed to (3,3).

The path from the start to the end is then:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route avoids all the walls and navigates directly through the open corridors in the maze.
