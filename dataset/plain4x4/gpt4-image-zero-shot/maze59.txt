To solve the maze, begin at the entry point at (0,0) and navigate through the available paths until reaching the exit at (3,3). Based on the provided image and the walls, here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Start at (0,0). No walls block the path downward, so move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), moving right is blocked, so move down to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), move to the right to (2,1).
4. Continue right from (2,1) to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), moving right further is blocked, so move up to (1,2).
6. Continue moving up from (1,2) to (0,2).
7. From (0,2), moving right to (0,3) as forward is open.
8. From (0,3), all direct paths are blocked expect going down. Move to (1,3).
9. Finally, from (1,3), move down to (2,3) and then further down to (3,3), reaching the exit.

Thus, the solution path from entry to exit, avoiding all walls, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
