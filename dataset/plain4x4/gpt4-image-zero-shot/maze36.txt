Let's examine the maze to determine the best path from the entry point at (0, 0) to the exit at (3, 3).

1. Starting at (0,0), the only option is to move right to (0,1) since the top row doesn't have any walls blocking horizontal movement until the end.
2. Continue right from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2). Movement to the right is blocked by the wall at the last column.
4. From (1,2), we can move left to (1,1), avoiding the vertical wall between columns 2 and 3 at row 2.
5. Move further left from (1,1) to (1,0).
6. Then move down from (1,0) to (2,0).
7. Next, there's no obstacle moving to the right from (2,0) to (2,1) and further to (2,2).
8. From (2,2) continue right to (2,3).
9. Now, move down from (2,3) to the last row (3,3), which is the exit point.

The solution to the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
