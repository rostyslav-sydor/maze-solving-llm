To solve this maze, you start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate through to reach the exit at (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0). The only available movement is right to (0,1).
2. Move right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), you need to move down to (1,2) since moving further right leads to a wall.
4. Continue downward to (2,2) as moving right leads to a wall.
5. From (2,2), there is no wall to the right, so move to (2,3).
6. From here, move downward to (3,3), which is the exit.

This path avoids all walls and navigates effectively to the maze exit. 

Hence, the path coordinates are:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
