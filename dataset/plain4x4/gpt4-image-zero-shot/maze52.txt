To solve the maze, begin at the starting point (0,0) and look for available paths by avoiding walls and advancing towards the goal (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0), you can only move right to (0,1) since moving down is blocked.
2. Move right to (0,2) and (0,3), as these cells are accessible and directly aligned without walls.
3. At (0,3), the path downwards is blocked by a wall, so backtrack to (0,2) and move downwards, as it’s the only available direction to explore.
4. From (0,2) move down to (1,2) and then (2,2) since the downward paths are open.
5. At (2,2), moving right to (2,3) is possible as there is no wall blocking this direction.
6. Move down from (2,3) to the goal at (3,3).

Thus, the solution path through the maze from entry (0,0) to exit (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
