To solve the maze from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), let's analyze the paths that are available:

1. Start at (0,0), the bottom left corner.
2. The path from (0,0) is blocked to the right and up. Move up to (0,1).
3. At (0,1), moving up to (0,2) or to the right are options; the right move goes towards the direction of (3,3). Thus, move right to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), we can move up to (1,2) as moving right is blocked.
5. Continue from (1,2) moving right. Arrive at (2,2) since moving up is blocked.
6. From (2,2), there's an open path down to (2,3).
7. Lastly, from (2,3), you can move right to reach the exit at (3,3).

Here is the simplified valid path from the entry to the exit:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
