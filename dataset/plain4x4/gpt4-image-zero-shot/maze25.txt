The maze can be solved by analyzing the given image, and plotting a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3) based on the openings in the walls.

1. Starting at (0,0), the only open path is to the right.
2. Move right to (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3). At this point, rows 1 and 2 on column 3 are blocked.
3. Move down to (1,3). Here, the only option is to move down again.
4. Continue moving down to (2,3) and then (3,3), which is the exit.

Hence, the path through the maze using the cells' coordinates is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
