To solve the maze, we begin tracing a path from the entry point at (0,0):

1. Start at (0,0) which is open.
2. Move to (1,0), as moving to the right to (0,1) is blocked by a wall.
3. From (1,0), moving downwards to (2,0) is blocked, thus the only option is to move right to (1,1).
4. At (1,1), moving ahead to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
6. At (1,3), you can only move down arriving at (2,3) since left and right are blocked.
7. From (2,3), move down to (3,3) which is the exit point.

Thus, the path from the entry to the exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
