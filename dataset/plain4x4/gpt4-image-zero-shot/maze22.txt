To solve the maze, start from the entry point at (0,0) and examine the possible moves:

1. From (0,0), move straight to (0,1) and (0,2) as there are no walls blocking these cells.
2. At (0,2), moving to (0,3) is not possible because of a wall. Hence, move down to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), move to (1,1) and further down to (2,1) as movement rightwards to (1,3) is blocked by a wall.
4. At (2,1), you can't move left to (2,0) or down to (3,1) because of walls, so move right to (2,2).
5. Move from (2,2) right to (2,3), and then down to the exit at (3,3) since these movements are unhindered by walls.

Thus, the path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
