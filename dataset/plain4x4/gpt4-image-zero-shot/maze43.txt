To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), one must follow a sequence of open paths while observing the walls that obstruct movement between cells.

1. Start at (0,0). The next feasible open path is directly to the right, to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the path to the right is blocked, so move down to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move right to (1,2) and continue right to (1,3).
4. At (1,3), the only option not blocked by walls is to move down to (2,3).
5. Continue from (2,3) down to (3,3) which is the exit.

Hence, the solution path from entry to exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
