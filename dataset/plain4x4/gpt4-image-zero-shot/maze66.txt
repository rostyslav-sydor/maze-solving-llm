To solve the maze, I'll identify a path from the start point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) by observing the open passages and avoiding walls.

1. Starting at (0,0), the only available move is horizontally to the right, as moving down is blocked by a wall. 
2. Move to (0,1) and continue to (0,2) and reach (0,3), as moving downwards at any of these points is blocked.
3. From (0,3), the only available move is down to (1,3) because moving to the left or right is inhibited by the boundary and walls.
4. Now move from (1,3) to (2,3), and then further down to the exit at (3,3) because moving left from (1,3) is blocked by a horizontal wall.

Path traversed considering the specifications:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequential movement bypasses all walls and reaches the exit while adhering to maze boundaries and wall restrictions.
