To solve the maze, start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate while avoiding walls, with the goal of reaching the exit at (3,3).

1. Starting at (0,0), your only option is to move right to (0,1) since the bottom side is blocked by a wall.
2. From (0,1), again, move right to (0,2) as the bottom side is still blocked.
3. From (0,2), move right to (0,3), as moving downward is blocked.
4. At (0,3), you cannot move right anymore and have to move down to (1,3) as moving left is blocked.
5. From (1,3), continue downward to (2,3) as left is blocked.
6. From (2,3), move down to (3,3), the exit point.

Putting it all together, the path to solve the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
