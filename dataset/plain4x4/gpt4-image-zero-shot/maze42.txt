To solve the maze provided, let's trace a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3). We consider the maze layout and wall placements within each cell:

1. Starting at (0,0), the only available move is downward to (1, 0), as (0,1) is blocked by a wall.
2. From (1,0), continue moving downward to (2,0). The rightward movement is blocked.
3. From (2,0), move right to (2,1) as the only feasible move.
4. From (2,1), move again right to (2,2) since a downward movement is blocked.
5. From (2,2), move down to (3,2), then the final feasible move is rightwards from (3,2) to (3,3), reaching the exit.

This creates a sequence of movements that successfully takes from the entrance to the exit, avoiding all walls. Summarizing these moves, the path taken is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
