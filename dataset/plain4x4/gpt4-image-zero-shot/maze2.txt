To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and trace a path to the exit at (3,3). Reviewing each cell and possible movement direction while respecting the indicated walls which restrict movement:

1. Start at (0,0) where the only possible move without encountering a wall is to the right.
2. Move to (0,1) and continue right to (0,2) as moving down is blocked by a wall.
3. From (0,2), move right again to (0,3).
4. The next possible movement from (0,3) is down to (1,3) without crossing any walls.
5. Continuing downward to (2,3), this path remains open.
6. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3) which is the exit point of the maze.

This results in a path from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, navigating around the walls in the maze.

**Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
