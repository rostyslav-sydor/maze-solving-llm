To solve the maze, we will trace a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3). 

Starting at (0,0), we can move right to (0,1) because there is no wall between these cells. Continuing from (0,1), we can again move right to (0,2), followed by further right to (0,3), as there are no walls obstructing these moves.

From (0,3), the next step is down to (1,3) since moving right into the next column is not an option (it's the maze boundary) and there's no wall blocking downward movement.

Continuing from (1,3), we move down to (2,3) and finally, since there are no walls, move further down to the exit at (3,3).

Thus, the path we have traced is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
