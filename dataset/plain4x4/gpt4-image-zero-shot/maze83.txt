To find the path from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3) in the provided maze image, I will trace a route that navigates through open passages while avoiding walls denoted by thick lines.

1. Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1) and (0,2) because no walls are blocking the way.
2. From (0,2), move directly down to (1,2) and then to (2,2) as the path downwards is clear.
3. Continue downwards from (2,2) to the final row, reaching (3,2).
4. Move right from (3,2) to the exit at (3,3). This completes the path from entrance to exit.

Thus the path solution for the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
