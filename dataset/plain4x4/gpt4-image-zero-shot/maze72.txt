To solve the maze and find a path from the entry point (0, 0) to the exit point (3, 3) with the walls represented as black lines, we will visually trace a path:

1. Begin at (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1).
3. Move from (0,1) to (1,1).
4. Move from (1,1) to (1,2).
5. Move from (1,2) to (1,3).
6. Move from (1,3) to (2,3).
7. Move from (2,3) to (3,3).

Thus, the coordinates of the path from entry to exit without crossing any walls are:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
