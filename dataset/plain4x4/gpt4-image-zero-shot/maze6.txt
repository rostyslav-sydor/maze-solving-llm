To solve the maze starting from entry point (0,0) and ending at exit point (3,3), follow the open paths allowed by the maze's walls:

1. Start at the initial position (0,0). From here, the only possible direction to move is to the right as there are walls blocking upward and downward movements.
2. Move right to (0,1) and then to (0,2) and (0,3) since there are no walls obstructing the path to the right.
3. At (0,3), you can only move downward to (1,3) because moving left or right is blocked by walls.
4. From (1,3), continue down to (2,3) and then to (3,3) as there are no walls obstructing movement downwards.
5. At (3,3), you've reached the exit point.

Thus, the solution path in the given format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
