To solve the maze, we'll start at the entry point (0,0) and navigate towards the exit point (3,3). We will look for viable paths that circumvent the walls, which are depicted as thick black lines. We have to ensure that we do not cross any walls.

1. Starting from (0,0), you can move directly to the right to (0,1) because there is no wall between these cells.
2. Continue from (0,1) to (0,2), and then to (0,3), following the open path along the top row.
3. At (0,3), move downwards to (1,3) as no wall blocks this movement.
4. Continue descending from (1,3) to (2,3) and then to (3,3), successfully reaching the exit, still without encountering any walls.

These movements ensure a clear path following permitted openings and therefore complete the traversal from entrance to exit.

**Solution Path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
