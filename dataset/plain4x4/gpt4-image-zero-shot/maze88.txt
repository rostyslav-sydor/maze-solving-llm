To navigate through the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), we analyze the accessible paths, considering the thick black lines as walls blocking the way:

1. Start at (0,0). Movement to the right to (0,1) is possible as there is no wall between these cells.
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2) which is free from any obstacles.
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3). No wall here either.
4. From (0,3), the only option is to move downwards to (1,3) because moving right is blocked by the bounds of the maze.
5. Move down again from (1,3) to (2,3) as there isn't a wall and it progresses towards the target.
6. From (2,3), continue downward to (3,3), which is the designated exit of the maze.

This route covers all accessible paths without being hindered by walls, leading directly from the entrance to the exit.

Final path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
