To solve the maze, we'll analyze the passable paths from the start to the exit.

1. Start at the entry point (0,0). Move right to (0,1).
2. Continue moving right from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move downwards to (1,2).
4. Continue downwards from (1,2) to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move downwards to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), move right to the exit at (3,3).

Considering all possible paths from each accessible cell and avoiding the walls (thick black lines), the optimal solution is the direct path that navigates through available openings, avoiding detours.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
