To solve this maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), observe the configuration of the walls:

1. Start at (0,0). The only possible move is to go right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), continue right to (0,2).
3. At (0,2), the only allowed movement is down to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), proceed further down to (2,2), bypassing a horizontal wall blocking any leftward movement.
5. From (2,2), move down again to (3,2), as moving to the right would hit a wall.
6. Finally, from (3,2), move to the right to reach the exit at (3,3).

This pathway bypasses all walls and achieves the objective of traveling from the entrance to the exit point of the maze. The steps outline a clear path which does not backtrack or hit any dead ends, making use of all available openings. Thus, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
