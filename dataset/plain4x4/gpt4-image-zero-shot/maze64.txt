To solve the given maze, I visually traced the path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3). Here's the reasoning along with each step:

1. Start at (0,0) where there's an opening.
2. Move right to (0,1) because (1,0) is blocked by a wall.
3. Continue right to (0,2) and then (0,3) because moving downwards is obstructed by a wall at (1,3).
4. Move down to (1,3) since there’s no wall blocking the downward path.
5. Move left to (1,2) and then further left to (1,1), avoiding walls that block the direct path downwards.
6. Now move downwards to (2,1) and then to (3,1) as these paths are clear.
7. Finally, move right to (3,2) and then to the exit at (3,3).

Therefore, the correct path from the entry to the exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
