To solve the maze, you begin at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). By examining the walls displayed in thick black lines, you can determine where you can move. You can move right, left, up, or down, unless blocked by a wall.

1. From (0,0), move directly to (0,1) since no wall is blocking the way.
2. Continue from (0,1) to (0,2), again not obstructed.
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3), as this pathway is still open.
4. At (0,3), move down to (1,3), since moving further right is blocked.
5. Continue moving downward to (2,3) to get closer to the exit.
6. Proceed from (2,3) to (3,3), the exit point.

Analyzing the maze in terms of possible routes, this is the only direct way from the start at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3) without encountering walls.

Thus, the solution based on the unobstructed moves can be described as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
