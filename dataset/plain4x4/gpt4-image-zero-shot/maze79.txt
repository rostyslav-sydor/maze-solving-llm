Starting from the entry point at (0,0), we observe the adjacent cells. The path can move right to (0,1) because there is no wall between (0,0) and (0,1).

From (0,1), moving further right to (0,2) and (0,3) is blocked by a wall. Our available move is down to (1,1).

At (1,1), we cannot move upward or downward since there are walls, but moving right to (1,2) is possible.

From (1,2), moving right to (1,3) is allowed because there is no wall blocking the path.

From (1,3), moving downwards is clear and feasible to (2,3) since the path is unblocked.

Finally, from (2,3), moving down again to (3,3) reaches the exit point without encountering walls.

Thus, the path solution from the entry to the exit of the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
