To solve the maze, we will trace a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), navigating through open paths marked by the absence of thick black lines (walls).

1. Start at (0,0). Moving downward is blocked by a wall, so move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), again, going right is blocked, hence move down to (1,1).
3. At (1,1), move right to (1,2) and then further to (1,3).
4. From (1,3), the right edge has no connection, so we move down to (2,3).
5. Continue downwards from (2,3) to (3,3) since no walls are blocking and it is an open path direct to the exit.

Summarizing this path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This trace utilizes clear pathways while avoiding walls, ensuring a valid path from the entry point to the exit point in the maze.
