To solve the maze from entry point (0,0) to exit point (3,3), we can navigate through the maze by avoiding the walls and finding a route that connects these points. Analyzing the image:

1. Start at (0,0). Only possible move is to the right.
2. Move to (0,1). Move right again.
3. At (0,2), move down to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move down to (2,2).
5. Now at (2,2), the right pathway to (2,3) is unblocked.
6. Proceed right to (2,3). Now move down to reach towards the exit.
7. At (3,3), the exit point is reached.

Thus, the path to navigate through the maze without hitting walls comprises of these sequential moves:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
