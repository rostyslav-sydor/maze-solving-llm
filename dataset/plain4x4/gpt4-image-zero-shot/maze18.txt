To solve this maze, we begin at the start point (0,0) and navigate through the cells while avoiding walls, heading towards the exit point (3,3). Here’s the logical path:

1. Starting at (0,0), the right side (east) is open, so move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the only open path is down (south) to (1,1).
3. At (1,1), moving right (east) to (1,2) is allowed.
4. From (1,2), continue right (east) to (1,3).
5. Moving down from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move down again to (3,3), which is the exit.

Mapping these movements, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence avoids all walls and successfully leads from the entry to exit of the maze.
