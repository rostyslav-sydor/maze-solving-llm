Starting at (0,0), move right to (0,1) because moving downward is blocked by a wall. From (0,1), again move right to (0,2) because moving down is still blocked. Move from (0,2) to (0,3), completing all possible moves along the top row. From (0,3), you can move downward as there are no obstacles, advancing to (1,3).

At (1,3), move down again to (2,3) as moving left is blocked. From (2,3), continue down to (3,3), which is the exit point. All movements are free of obstacles, making the path straightforward from (0,3) downward to the exit.

Hence, the path through the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
