To solve this maze, let's follow a simple method by looking at possible pathways from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3), avoiding walls:

1. Start at (0,0). Move right to (0,1) as the right side is open.
2. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2) as there’s no wall blocking the downward path.
4. Continue moving downward from (1,2) to (2,2) since moving right to (1,3) is blocked by a wall.
5. Move right from (2,2) to (2,3) since the right path is clear.
6. Then, move down from (2,3) to (3,3) where the exit is located, as the path is unobstructed.

Each move is chosen based on an accessible path without walls obstructing the way to the adjacent cells. The route traces a path around the center wall, navigating through available corridors created by the spaces without walls.

Here is the path as a coordinate list:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
