To solve the maze provided, we need to find a path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3) by navigating through the open passages and avoiding walls.

1. **Start at (0,0)** - This is the entry point.
2. **Move to (1,0)** - The path directly south from (0,0) is open.
3. **Move to (2,0)** - Continuing south from (1,0) is unobstructed.
4. **Move to (3,0)** - The open passage allows moving further south.
5. **Move to (3,1)** - From (3,0), you can move right (east). 
6. **Move to (3,2)** - Continue moving east from (3,1).
7. **Move to (3,3)** - Continue moving east to reach the exit.

Thus, the successful path through the maze from the entry to the exit point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This route sequentially focuses on first moving down the first column and then moving right along the last row, which the walls of the maze permit.
