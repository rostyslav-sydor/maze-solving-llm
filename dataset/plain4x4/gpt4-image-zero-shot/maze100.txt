To solve the maze from entry (0,0) to exit (3,3), we need to navigate through open paths, avoiding walls.

- Start at (0,0). The only open path is to move right to (0,1).
- From (0,1), continue right to (0,2).
- At (0,2), you can move down to (1,2).
- From (1,2), move down to (2,2).
- At (2,2), continue downward to (3,2) as the path directly to (3,3) is blocked by a wall.
- Finally, from (3,2), move right into the exit at (3,3).

So, the path coordinates are:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
