To solve the maze, start at the entry point (0,0) and move step-by-step, avoiding walls, to reach the exit point (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0). The only open path is moving to the right.
2. From (0,0), move right to (0,1).
3. Continue right to (0,2).
4. Move down from (0,2) to (1,2).
5. Move right from (1,2) to (1,3).
6. Now move down from (1,3) to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), go further down to (3,3) to reach the exit.

Combining the sequence of moves, the path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path avoids all walls and successfully navigates from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
