To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), we analyze the maze's layout and navigate through the pathways while avoiding the walls.

1. Start at (0,0). From here, the only option is to move right.
2. Move to (0,1). Continuing right to the adjacent clear path.
3. At (0,2), continue right as it is the only available path without a wall.
4. At (0,3), the only pathway available is downward to row 1.
5. Now at (1,3), continue downward as the path leads vertically down.
6. At (2,3), there is again only one option, which is to move downward.
7. Finally, moving to (3,3) is a clear path downward from (2,3), reaching the exit point.

The path through the maze from start to finish without crossing any walls is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
