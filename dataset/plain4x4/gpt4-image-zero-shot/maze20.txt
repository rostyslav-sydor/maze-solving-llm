To solve the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), follow the path that avoids walls and navigates through the open passages.

Starting at (0,0), move to the right as the path is clear:
- Move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2) and finally to (0,3).

At (0,3), move downwards because the path to the right is blocked by a wall:
- Move from (0,3) to (1,3).

Continue from (1,3) down to (2,3) since moving left or right is not possible:
- Move from (1,3) to (2,3).

From (2,3), you can move down to the last row:
- Move from (2,3) to (3,3).

This pathway reaches the exit point at (3,3) without encountering any obstructive walls.

Sequence of movements in coordinate format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
