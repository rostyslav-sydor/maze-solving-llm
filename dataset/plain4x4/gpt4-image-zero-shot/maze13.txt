To find the solution for the maze, we can follow the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) by checking open paths without running into walls.

1. Start at (0,0), which is open.
2. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) as moving down leads to a wall. 
3. From (0,1), continue to move right to (0,2) since down is blocked by a wall.
4. Now at (0,2), the only open direction without a wall is down. Move down to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), continue moving down to (2,2).
6. At (2,2), only the right (2,3) and down (3,2) paths are open. Moving to (3,2) sets up for easier access to the exit. Move down to (3,2).
7. Then move right from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the exit point.

This sequence of moves avoids all walls and successfully navigates from entrance to exit and is represented by the coordinates:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
