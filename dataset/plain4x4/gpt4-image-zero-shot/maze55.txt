To solve the maze, we start from the entry point at (0,0) and explore paths that do not cross the black lines (walls). From the visualization and description:

1. Begin at (0,0), which is the entry point.
2. Move right to (0,1), and then to (0,2) - moving further to the right towards (0,3) would cross a wall, so it's not allowed.
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
4. Continue moving down to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move right to (2,3).
6. Since moving right from (2,3) would hit the border, move down to (3,3), which is the exit point.

Thus, the path from the entrance to the exit is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
