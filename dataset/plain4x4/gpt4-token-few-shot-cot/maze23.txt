To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the latest adjacency list, let's analyze the provided maze description.

First, we'll summarize the adjacency pairs provided:

1. (2,1) <-> (1,1)
2. (1,1) <-> (1,0)
3. (0,2) <-> (1,2)
4. (1,2) <-> (1,3)
5. (2,1) <-> (3,1)
6. (3,1) <-> (3,0)
7. (0,2) <-> (0,3)
8. (1,3) <-> (2,3)
9. (1,2) <-> (2,2)
10. (1,0) <-> (0,0)
11. (2,3) <-> (3,3)
12. (0,2) <-> (0,1)
13. (3,2) <-> (3,3)
14. (3,2) <-> (3,1)
15. (3,0) <-> (2,0)

Using these links, the strategy will be to find a sequence of valid moves that connects the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Let's work through the maze.

Starting at (0,0):
1. Move to (1,0) via (1,0) <-> (0,0)
2. Move to (1,1) via (1,1) <-> (1,0)
3. Move to (1,2) via (1,2) <-> (1,1)
4. Move to (1,3) via (1,3) <-> (1,2)
5. Move to (2,3) via (2,3) <-> (1,3)
6. Move to (3,3) via (3,3) <-> (2,3)

This path connects from (0,0) to (3,3) by following the listed movements. The finalized path would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This is the continuous route through the provided maze layout that successfully reaches the target.
