Considering the maze represented by the adjacency list and the origin and target positions indicated, let's trace out the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) From (0,0) move right to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1)
2) From (0,1) move right to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2)
3) From (0,2) move right to and up via (0,2) <--> (1,2)
4) From (1,2) move right to (1,3) via (1,2) <--> (1,3)
5) From (1,3) move down to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (1,3)
6) From (2,3) move left to (2,2) via (2,3) <--> (2,2)
7) From (2,2) move down to (3,2) via (2,2) <--> (3,2)
8) From (3,2) move right to the exit at (3,3) via (3,2) <--> (3,3)

We can confirm each step is valid from the adjacency list provided. Thus, the final solution will be in the formatted requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
