To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the given maze represented as an adjacency list, we can follow these steps based on the connections detailed in the adjacency list:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via adjacency: (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via adjacency: (0,2) <--> (0,1)
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3) via adjacency: (0,3) <--> (0,2)
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via adjacency: (1,3) <--> (0,3)
5) Move left from (1,3) to (1,2) via adjacency: (1,2) <--> (1,1)
6) Move left from (1,2) to (1,1) via adjacency: (1,1) <--> (1,0)
7) Move left from (1,1) to (1,0) via adjacency: (1,0) <--> (1,1) 
8) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0) via adjacency: (2,0) <--> (1,0)
9) Move right from (2,0) to (2,1) via adjacency: (2,1) <--> (2,2)
10) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) via adjacency: (2,2) <--> (2,1)
11) Move right from (2,2) to (2,3) via adjacency: (2,3) <--> (2,2)
12) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via adjacency: (3,3) <--> (2,3)

The final solution path, traversing through these steps without needing to backtrack due to dead ends or missing connections, would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, weâ€™ve navigated according to the adjacency pairs to move from the maze's origin to its target without encountering any blocks or loops that prevent reaching the final destination.
