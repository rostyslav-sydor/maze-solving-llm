For the provided maze represented as an adjacency list, the goal is to find the path from the specified origin, (0,0), to the target, (3,3). Below is the step-by-step tracing of the path based on given connections:

1) Start from origin (0,0).
2) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) using (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) using (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4) Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) using (0,2) <--> (1,2).
5) Move down from (1,2) to (2,2) using (1,2) <--> (2,2).
6) Move right from (2,2) to (2,3) using (2,2) <--> (2,3).
7) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) using (2,3) <--> (3,3).

This series of moves from the origin to the target does not require any backtracking, since a connection exists between each step and the subsequent one, leading all the way to the target.

Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
