To solve the maze provided in the final scenario, we need to find a pathway from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list. Let's plot the solution using the adjacency list:

1) Start at (0,0)
2) Move right to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1)
3) Move down to (1,1) via (0,1) <--> (1,1)
4) Move down to (2,1) via (2,1) <--> (1,1)
5) Move left to (2,0) via (2,0) <--> (2,1)
6) Move down to (3,0) via (3,0) <--> (2,0)
7) Move right to (3,1) via (3,1) <--> (3,0)
8) Move right to (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (3,1)
9) Move right to (3,3) via (3,2) <--> (3,3)

Thus, the path through the maze can be documented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route ensures traversal of the maze from the start to the finish by strictly following adjacency and moving from each vertex to an accessible connected vertex until the target is reached.
