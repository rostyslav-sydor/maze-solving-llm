To solve the maze described by the last adjacency list provided and to find the path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we can analyze and traverse the maze based on the connections given.

1) Begin from the origin `(0,0)` specified by `<ORIGIN_START>`.
2) Move right to `(0,1)` via `(0,1) <--> (0,0)`.
3) Continue moving right to `(0,2)` via `(0,2) <--> (0,1)`.
4) Move down to `(1,2)` via `(0,2) <--> (1,2)`.
5) Continue along the row by moving left to `(1,1)` via `(1,2) <--> (1,1)`.
6) Move down to `(2,1)` via `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`.
7) Move left from `(2,1)` to `(1,1)` via `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`.
8) Move down to `(2,1)` from `(1,1)` tracing the same path again via `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`.
9) Move left to `(2,0)` via `(2,1) <--> (2,0)`.
10) Move down to `(3,0)` via `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`.
11) Move to the east from `(3,0)` to `(3,1)` via `(3,1) <--> (3,0)`.
12) Move to the east from `(3,1)` to `(3,2)` via `(3,2) <--> (3,1)`.
13) Finally, move to the east from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)` via `(3,3) <--> (3,2)`.

Constructing the list based on nodes visited:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This solution provides a successful traversal from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using the available connections from the adjacency list provided.
