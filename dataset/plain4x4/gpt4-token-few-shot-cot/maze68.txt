To solve the last maze described, the maze is presented with adjacency relationships. We need to navigate from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). Using the given adjacency relationships, we can trace a path through the maze. Below, I have used the relationships to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3).

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4. Move right from (0,2) to (0,3) via (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5. Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via (0,3) <--> (1,3).
6. Move down from (1,3) to (2,3) via (1,3) <--> (2,3).
7. Move right from (2,3) to (3,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3).

This direct path is found by following the connections provided in the adjacency list directly, without requiring any backtracking or blocked paths. Each step moves directly adjacent either vertically or horizontally as allowed by the relationships defined.

Here is the required result in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
