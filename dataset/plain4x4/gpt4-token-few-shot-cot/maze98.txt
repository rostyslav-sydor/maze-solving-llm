To find the solution for the maze represented, we'll start by identifying all valid moves given in the adjacency list and then trace a path from the origin to the target. Let's follow these moves step-by-step:

1. Start at the origin (0,0)
2. Move down from (0,0) to (1,0) via (0,0) <--> (1,0)
3. Move to the right from (1,0) to (1,1) via (1,0) <--> (1,1)
4. Move to the right from (1,1) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (1,1)
5. Move further right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2)
6. Move to (0,3) from (0,2) via (0,3) <--> (0,2)
7. Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via (0,3) <--> (1,3)
8. Move to (1,2) from (1,3) via (1,2) <--> (1,3)
9. Move to (2,2) from (1,2) via (2,2) <--> (1,2)
10. Move to (2,3) from (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,3)
11. Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3)

By connecting these paths, we find the route to reach from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) travelling through the available paths:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze leveraging the adjacency connections provided to get from the starting point to the finish effectively.
