To solve the given maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we aim to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Given the adjacency relationships, determining the correct sequence of movements is crucial to creating the path.

Maze Steps:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1), using the connection (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Move right to (0,2), then due to available movements, move down to (1,2) using connection (0,2) <--> (1,2).
4. Move right to (1,3) by (1,3) <--> (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,3), using the connection (1,3) <--> (2,3).
6. Move right to (3,3) via connection (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Here is the solution sequence in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path sequence, (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), successfully navigates from the origin to the target using the established adjacency relationships provided in the maze description.
