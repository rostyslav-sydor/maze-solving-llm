To solve the maze described in the last part, we first need to analyze the adjacency list of the maze, and explore potential paths from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here's the maze's adjacency representation in a readable format along with tracking the path to the exit:

**Adjacency List**:
```
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
(1,1) <--> (0,1)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(1,3) <--> (1,2)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
```

**Path Solution**:

Starting at (0,0), feasible transitions based on the adjacency list:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,0)
2. Move right from (1,0) to (2,0)
3. Move right from (2,0) to (3,0)
4. Move up from (3,0) to (3,1)
5. Move up from (3,1) to (3,2)
6. Move right from (3,2) to (2,2)
7. Move left from (2,2) to (1,2)
8. Move up from (1,2) to (1,3)
9. Move left from (1,3) to (2,3)
10. Move left from (2,3) to (3,3)

Thus, the format for output:

<PATH_START> 
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) 
<PATH_END> 

Each move listed follows directly from one coordinate to an adjacent coordinate following the paths established in the adjacency list. This allows for a completion of the maze from the origin to the target.
