Based on the maze structure provided in the adjacency list and the specified origin and target, the following sequence of movements provides a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3):

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (1,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,2) <--> (0,1) 
3) Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (0,2)
4) Move right from (1,2) to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (1,2)
5) Move down from (2,2) to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (2,2)
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (2,3) 

Presenting the sequence of movements from the origin to the target as a path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
