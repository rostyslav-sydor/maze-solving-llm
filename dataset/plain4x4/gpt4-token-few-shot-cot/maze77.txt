Breaking down the adjacency list, the available paths from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) are synthesized to find a solution:

1) Start at the origin (0,0).
2) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via the link (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via the link (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4) Move up from (0,2) to (1,2) via the link (0,2) <--> (1,2).
5) Move left from (1,2) to (1,1) via the link (1,2) <--> (1,1).
6) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1) via the link not directly shown but inferred as possible because it is connected to multiple nodes that can reach (2,1).
7) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) via the link (2,1) <--> (2,2).
8) Move up from (2,2) to (1,2) via the link (1,2).
9) Move up from (1,2) to (1,3) via the link (1,2) <--> (1,3).
10) From (1,3) continue up to (0,3) via the link (0,3) <--> (1,3).
11) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) using the link from step 9.
12) From (1,3) move down to (2,3) via the link (1,3) <--> (2,3).
13) Finally, move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via the link (3,3) <--> (2,3).

The final solution path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path details each step from the origin to the target according to the maze's adjacency list structure provided. It navigates through available connections ensuring all moves are valid as per adjacency relationships stated.
