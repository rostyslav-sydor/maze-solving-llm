To solve this maze based on the adjacency list provided, the steps to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) are as follows:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. We can go from (0,2) to (1,2) via (0,2) <--> (1,2) and continue navigating through that row.
5. Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) via (0,2) <--> (1,2).
6. Move right from (1,2) to (1,3) via (1,3) <--> (1,2).
7. Move down from (1,3) to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (1,3).
8. Move right from (2,3) to (3,3).

This pathway directly leads you from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3) without any need to backtrack. Here is the exact path encoded in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This pathway is derived step-by-step based on the available direct connections defined in the adjacency list. Each step chooses the right path to move from one node (intersection) to the next based on available exits until the target (3,3) is reached.
