For the provided maze, to find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I will explore the adjacency list while considering valid movements that contribute towards reaching the target.

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1), as indicated in the adjacency list.
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,3) <--> (0,2), as specified in the adjacency list.
3) From (0,2) move right again to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,2).

Since (0,3) is connected to (1,3), we proceed:
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3).

From (1,3), we see it connects with (2,3):
5) Move down from (1,3) to (2,3).

Finally, follow the link from (2,3) to (3,3):
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3), which is the target.

Summarizing the moves:
- We took a horizontal path on the top row reaching from (0,0) to (0,3).
- Then we travelled vertically downward from (0,3) to (3,3).

Outputting this path in the specified format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
