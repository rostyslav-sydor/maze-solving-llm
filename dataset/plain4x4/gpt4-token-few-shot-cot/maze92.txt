To solve the maze given in the final segment, I will analyze the adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) Start from (0,0) and move right to (0,1), since (0,1) <--> (0,0) is in the list.
2) Move from (0,1) to (0,2), since (0,2) <--> (0,1) is in the list.
3) Move from (0,2) to (1,2), since (0,2) <--> (1,2) is in the list.
4) Move from (1,2) to (2,2), since (2,2) <--> (1,2) is not available, so no direct path from (1,2) to (2,2). Instead, we need a different routing from (1,2):
   - First, backtrack to (1,2) to (1,3) since (1,2) <--> (1,3) is in the list.
   - From (1,3) to (2,3) since (2,3) <--> (1,3) is in the list.

Once at (2,3), use:
5) Move from (2,3) to (3,3) since (3,3) <--> (3,2) and (3,2) <--> (3,1) & (3,1) <--> (3,0).

Given the adjacency list, this seems like the correct pathway. Thus the solution path for the maze would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This route navigates from the start to the end efficiently utilizing the available paths indicated in the adjacency list.
