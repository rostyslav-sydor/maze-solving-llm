To solve the last given maze using the given adjacency list which describes the connectivity between different nodes (positions) in the maze, let's map out the path from the specified origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). We will utilize a depth-first search (DFS) strategy based on the given connections:

1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) using connection (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Continue right from (0,1) to (0,2) using connection (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4. Continue right from (0,2) to (0,3) using connection (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5. (0,3) does not connect directly downward; backtrack to (0,2).
6. Backtrack to (0,1).
7. Backtrack to (0,0). Now, take a different path - go right to (0,1) using (0,0) <--> (0,1).
8. Move down diagonally from (0,1) to (1,1) using (1,1) <--> (0,1).
9. Continue downward diagonally from (1,1) to (2,1) using (1,1) <--> (2,1).
10. Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) using (2,1) <--> (2,2).
11. Move left from (2,2) to (2,1), then right again (since there's no other option).
12. Move left from (2,1) to (1,1).
13. Move down diagonally from (1,1) to (2,1) using (1,1) <--> (2,1).
14. Move right and down from (2,1) to (2,2) using (2,1) <--> (2,2) and then (2,2) <--> (2,3).
15. From (2,3), move down to (3,3) using (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Each step above corresponds to moving between nodes that are explicitly connected in the maze's given adjacency list. Given that the maze traversal doesn't backtrack beyond the initial node, this DFS maintains a path leading directly to the target without returning to prior nodes excessively. Other paths may exist but need thorough exploration of the list's adjacency relationships.

Final form of the solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
