To solve this maze, we can follow these steps:

1) Start at the origin point (0,0).
2) Note, there is a connection between (0,0) and (1,0) via (1,0) <--> (0,0).
3) After stepping to (1,0), there is a path to (2,0) via (2,0) <--> (1,0).
4) From (2,0), move right to (2,1) - linked by (2,1) <--> (2,0).
5) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) - there exists (2,2) <--> (2,1).
6) From (2,2), move right to (2,3) - linked by (2,3) <--> (2,2).
7) After reaching (2,3), move up to (1,3) - there's a path (1,3) <--> (2,3).
8) Now move from (1,3) to (0,3) - the link is (0,3) <--> (1,3).
9) From (0,3), we do not have a direct connection to (3,3), thus, backtrack:
   - From (0,3) to (1,3)
   - From (1,3) to (2,3)
10) From (2,3), move right again to (2,2).
11) Then move down from (2,2) to (3,2) - via (3,2) <--> (2,2).
12) Finally move from (3,2) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (3,2) to reach the target.

The final path will look like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This pathway finds the shortest route through the maze using the adjacency relationships from the given list, moving through allowable connections and backtracking as necessary to avoid dead ends and reach the destination.
