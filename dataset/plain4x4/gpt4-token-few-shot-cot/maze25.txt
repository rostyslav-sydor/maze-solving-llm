Considering the adjacency list provided for this maze and the indication of start (origin) position (0,0) and target (destination) at (3,3), let's find the possible path for solving this maze:

1) From the origin (0,0), you can move right to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0).

2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2).

3) Continue moving right from (0,2) to (0,3) via (0,2) <--> (0,3).

4) Now, move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via (0,3) <--> (1,3).

5) Move from (1,3) to (2,3) via (1,3) <--> (2,3).

6) Then from (2,3), move to (3,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Based on the provided adjacency list, the sequence of moves forms a valid path from the start (origin) position to the target (destination). Let's output this path.

<PATH_START> 
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) 
<PATH_END> 

This path indeed moves from the upper left corner (start) directly towards the right and then progressively downwards, only moving left or right when necessary according to the adjacency given, which leads to the bottom right corner (end, target) of the maze.
