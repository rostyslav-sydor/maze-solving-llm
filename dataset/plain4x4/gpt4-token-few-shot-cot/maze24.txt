To solve the maze given in the task, we need to navigate from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) through the available paths defined by the adjacency list. First, let's reconstruct the adjacency relationship and determine the paths:

### Adjacency List 
- (3,0) <--> (3,1) 
- (2,0) <--> (1,0) 
- (3,3) <--> (2,3) 
- (3,1) <--> (3,2) 
- (0,3) <--> (0,2) 
- (0,1) <--> (1,1) 
- (0,0) <--> (1,0) 
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1) 
- (3,0) <--> (2,0) 
- (3,2) <--> (3,3) 
- (3,1) <--> (2,1) 
- (1,3) <--> (0,3) 
- (1,1) <--> (1,2) 
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)

### Pathfinding Process:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Move further right to (1,1) via (0,1) <--> (1,1).
4. Move further right to (1,2) via (1,1) <--> (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2) from (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (2,2).
6. From (2,2), move right to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3). However, direct move is not possible. Move to (1,3).
7. Move down from (1,3) to (2,3) via (1,3) <--> (2,3).
8. Finally, move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Thus, the path from the origin to the target is as follows:

### Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

### Explanation:
The solution navigates from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by following the available paths in the adjacency list. At each step, the direction and adjacency are checked to ensure it moves closer to the target while observing possible legal movements defined in the adjacency list.
