To solve this maze represented by the latest given adjacency list, we can analyze the connections and dependencies between the coordinates to chart the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Here's the description of the pathways based on connections:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2)
3. Move right from (0,2) to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,2)
4. Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via (0,3) <--> (1,3)
5. Move left from (1,3) to (1,2) via (1,3) <--> (2,3)
6. Move down from (1,2) to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (1,2)
7. Move left from (2,2) to (2,1) via (2,1) <--> (2,2)
8. Move up from (2,1) to (1,1) via (1,1) <--> (2,1)
9. Move down from (1,1) back to (2,1) (as previous connections directed to this path for continuity in solving) via (2,1) <--> (1,1)
10. Move down from (2,1) to (3,1) via (3,1) <--> (2,1)   
11. Move left from (3,1) to (3,0) via (3,1) <--> (3,0)
12. Move right from (3,0) back to (3,1) (as a step back on reversed path) via (3,1) <--> (3,0)
13. Move right from (3,1) to (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (3,1)
14. Move right from (3,2) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (3,2)

This gives the following path solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This solution takes you from the entry point (0,0) to the exit (3,3) through a series of movements managed through multiple passes and a complete utilization of the adjacency relations in the maze definition.
