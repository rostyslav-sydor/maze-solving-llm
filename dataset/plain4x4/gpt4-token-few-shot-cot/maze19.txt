Considering all available adjacencies for the maze and tracing a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2) Move down from (0,1) to (1,1) via (1,1) <--> (0,1)
3) Move right from (1,1) to (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (1,1)
4) From (1,2) there are two options: further right to (1,3) or up to (0,2). Choose up to (0,2) due to immediate connectivity to the (1,3) from (0,2), but primary direct goal is (3,3).
5) From (0,2), move right to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,2)
6) From (0,3), move down to (1,3) via (1,3) <--> (0,3)
7) From (1,3), move right to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (1,3)
8) From (2,3), move up/right diagonal to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (2,3)

The connecting path found:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents a valid route through the maze that follows the adjacency list and the given rules for transitions between cells.
