To solve the maze presented in the final block, we first need to establish all available connections from the adjacency list and then use that information to plot the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Adjacency List Analysis:**
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (1,3) <-> (0,3)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (2,1) <-> (2,2)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (2,1) <-> (2,0)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)

**Steps to Solve the Maze:**
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move down to (1,0) using (1,0) <-> (0,0).
3. From (1,0), move right to (1,1) using (1,1) <-> (1,0).
4. From (1,1), move right to (1,2) using (1,2) <-> (1,1).
5. From (1,2), move right to (1,3) using (1,2) <-> (1,3).
6. From (1,3), move down to (2,3) using (1,3) <-> (2,3).
7. From (2,3), move right to (3,3) using (2,3) <-> (3,3).

**Final Solution (Path from Start to Target):**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of steps takes you from the origin to the target using the available connections in the adjacency list without backtracking or hitting any walls.
