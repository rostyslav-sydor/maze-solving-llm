To solve the final maze presented, we first need to organize the adjacency data from the maze description into a readable format. After that, we can trace a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the available adjacency list.

Adjacency list formatted:
- (0,0) --> (1,0)
- (0,1) --> (1,1), (0,2)
- (0,2) --> (0,1), (0,3)
- (0,3) --> (1,3)
- (1,0) --> (0,0), (2,0)
- (1,1) --> (0,1)
- (1,2) --> (1,3), (2,2)
- (1,3) --> (1,2)
- (2,0) --> (1,0), (3,0), (2,1)
- (2,1) --> (2,0)
- (2,2) --> (1,2), (2,3)
- (2,3) --> (2,2), (3,3)
- (3,0) --> (2,0), (3,1)
- (3,1) --> (3,2), (3,0)
- (3,2) --> (3,1), (3,3)
- (3,3) --> (2,3), (3,2)

Now, let's trace the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) Start at (0,0) and move to (1,0)
2) From (1,0), move to (2,0)
3) From (2,0), move to (3,0)
4) From (3,0), move to (3,1)
5) From (3,1), move to (3,2)
6) From (3,2), move to the target (3,3)

Thus, the path traced using the adjacency list from the origin to the target is sequentially connected as follows:

Final solution for the path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path indicates a clear route from the starting point to the finish, following the adjacency relationships provided.
