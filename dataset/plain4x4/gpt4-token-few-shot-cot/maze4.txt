Given the adjacency list for the final maze scenario and the required transformation of place (0,0) to (3,3), the following possible route is determined from the described connections:

1) Start at (0,0).
2) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via connecting path (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3) Continue right from (0,1) to (0,2) via connecting path derived from a vicinity move (at (0,3) --> (0,2) and backward).
4) Move right again from (0,2) to (0,3) also via connecting path (0,3) <--> (0,2).
5) From top row, we navigate vertically. Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) via (0,3) <--> (1,3).
6) Continue moving downwards from (1,3) to (2,3) via (1,3) <--> (2,3).
7) Finally, move down from (2,3) to the exit at (3,3) via the connecting path (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Thus, we have constructed a viable solution traversing from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3).

Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
