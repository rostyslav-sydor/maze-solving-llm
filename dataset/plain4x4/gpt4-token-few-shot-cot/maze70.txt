To find the solution for this maze presented as an adjacency list, I'll use a search algorithm (like BFS) to find the path from the origin to the target coordinate:

1. Start at the origin: (0,0)

**Exploring paths using adjacency connectivity:**
- `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`
- `(0,2) <--> (1,2)`
- `(1,2) <--> (2,2)`
- `(2,2) <--> (3,2)`
- `(3,2) <--> (3,1)`
- `(3,1) <--> (3,0)`
- Now need to move back up because there is no horizontal path at 3rd row or by vertical path from (3,2) to 3,3
- `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`

**Traversing through the Maze:**
2. Move right from (0,0) to (0,1)
3. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
4. Move down from (0,2) to (1,2)
5. Move down from (1,2) to (2,2)
6. Move down from (2,2) to (3,2)
7. Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)

**Final Path:**
- This connects the origin to the target following the available paths indicated in the adjacency list.

Final solution:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`
