To solve the last maze and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can trace possible steps following the adjacency list, examining all possibilities while ensuring efficient backtracking only when necessary:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4. Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (0,2).
5. Continue moving down from (1,2) to (2,2) via (1,2) <--> (2,2).
6. Move right from (2,2) to (2,3) via (2,3) <--> (2,2).
7. Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path effectively utilizes the adjacency connections provided, ensuring each move is valid and leads towards the given target destination.
