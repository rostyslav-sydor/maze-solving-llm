To solve the maze through the given adjacency list and deducing the correct movements to reach from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), follow these steps:

1) Start at the origin (0,0).
2) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) using the adjacency (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3) Continue moving right from (0,1) to (0,2) using the adjacency (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4) Move further right from (0,2) to (0,3) using the adjacency (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3) using the adjacency (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6) Move left from (1,3) to (1,2) using the adjacency (1,3) <--> (1,2).
7) Continue moving left from (1,2) to (1,1) through adjacency (1,2) <--> (1,1).
8) Travel left from (1,1) to (1,0) using the adjacency from (1,1) <--> (0,1), but then use (1,0) which had moved from (0,0).
9) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0) using the adjacency (1,0) <--> (2,0).
10) Move right from (2,0) to (2,1) using the adjacency (2,0) <--> (2,1).
11) Move right from (2,1) to (3,1) through adjacency (2,1) <--> (3,1).
12) Move right from (3,1) to (3,2) following adjacency (3,2) <--> (3,1).
13) Move further right from (3,2) to reach the target (3,3) through the adjacency (3,3) <--> (3,2).

Here is the full path from start to end:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
