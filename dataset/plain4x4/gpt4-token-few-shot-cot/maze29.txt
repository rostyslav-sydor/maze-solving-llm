Considering the given adjacency list of the maze and starting at point (0,0) with the goal of reaching (3,3), we can map out the solution path by following the available connections:

1) Start from (0,0).
2) Move right to (0,1) via the adjacency (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3) Move right from (0,1) to (1,1) through the adjacency (0,1) <--> (1,1).
4) From (1,1), move right to (1,2) using the adjacency (1,1) <--> (1,2).
5) Move right from (1,2) to (1,3) using the adjacency (1,3) <--> (1,2).
6) Move down from (1,3) to (2,3) using the adjacency (1,3) <--> (2,3).
7) Finally, move down from (2,3) to (3,3) using the adjacency (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Final path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
