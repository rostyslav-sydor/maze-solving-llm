The maze's adjacency list format details the connections between each grid coordinate pair. This maze's origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3). Here's the step-by-step solution to navigate through the maze from the origin to the target:

1) Start at the origin (0,0).
2) Move right to (0,1) via the adjacency (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3) Continue right to (0,2) via the adjacency (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4) Move down to (1,2) via the adjacency (0,2) <--> (1,2).
5) Move right to (1,3) via the adjacency (1,2) <--> (1,3).
6) Move down to (2,3) via the adjacency (2,3) <--> (1,3).
7) Finally, move down into the exit at (3,3) via the adjacency (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Thus, the successful path from the origin to the target is: 

<PATH_START> 
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END> 

This sequence directs us through a viable path in the maze from entry to exit based on the connections provided in the adjacency list.
