Ok, let's try to solve this step by step. Here's the plan:

1. Identify the starting point (S) and ending point (E).
2. Find the shortest possible path between the starting point and the destination.
3. Follow the path to move through the maze.
4. Output the maze with the solved path represented as a list of coordinates with (row, column) pairs.

Based on the maze layout you provided:

```
#########
#S  # # #
### # # #
#   # # #
# ### # #
#     # #
# ##### #
#      E#
#########

```

I've identified the starting point (S) at location (1,1) and the ending point (E) at (7,7).

Now, let's work on the solution. To solve this, I'll use a breadth-first search algorithm. Here's a simplified representation of the path from the starting point to the ending point (E):

```
Found a possible path to goal. Visiting (1, 1) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (3, 3) (4, 3) (4, 4) (5, 4) (5, 5) (6, 5) (6, 6) (6, 7) (7, 7) 

From E at (7, 7) the shortest path is (6, 7) (6, 6) (6, 5) (5, 5) (5, 4) (4, 4) (4, 3) (3, 3) (2, 3) (2, 2) (2, 1) (1, 1).
```

Now let's output the path in list form between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(2,1)
(2,2)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(4,3)
(4,4)
(5,4)
(5,5)
(6,5
