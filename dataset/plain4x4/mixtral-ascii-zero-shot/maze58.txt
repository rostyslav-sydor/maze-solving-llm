We start at (1,1) and search for a solution in the following form: <PATH_START> (1,1) (x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3) ... (7,7) <PATH_END>. To do this, we will find an open space where we could potentially step onto.

At (1,1), only (1,2) is an open space. So <PATH_START> becomes (1,1) (1,2).

At (1,2), there are two possibilities: (1,3) and (2,2). Let's try (1,3) first, so the path becomes (1,1) (1,2) (1,3).

At (1,3), there are no accessible open spaces, so we have to backtrack. Returning to (1,2), we will step to (2,2) instead. The partial path then becomes (1,1) (1,2) (2,2).

At (2,2), we can't go to (1,2), because we've already visited (1,2); we can't step through a wall to (2,1) or (3,2). So (3,3) is the only accessible open space. The partial path is then (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,3).

At (3,3), we reach a dead-end, so we again backtrack to (2,2).

At (2,2), we try the next open space, (2,3). The partial path becomes (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3).

At (2,3), we haven't visited (1,3) yet, so we step there: (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3). Now, we are at (1,3) again, with the same dead-end as before.

So we backtrack all the way to (2,2), and try the next available position, (2,4). The partial path is then (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,4).
