Let's decompose this task into its parts.

1. Parse the maze: We first have to convert the ASCII representation of the maze into a more convenient and parsable form.
2. Find path through maze: After we have parsed the maze, we can use a path-finding algorithm to find the solution to the maze.
3. Return answer: We should output the result in the format described in the problem statement.

For the path-finding, we need to choose an algorithm. The following algorithm would be suitable:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: This algorithm is very similar to BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs. The algorithm uses a priority queue to maintain a frontier. The algorithm solves the problem very efficiently if all weighting functions of edges are identical.
  
4. Libraries: Assuming we have access to some programming language like Python or Java, there are many libraries that implement algorithms like Breadth-first Search (BFS, think about basic tree traversal) and Dijkstra's.
5. Revision: Once the path has been found, we can check the result for mistakes and make sure that it looks correct. We should follow the result with <PATH_END> to signify the end of the path.
6. Result: Return the answer.

### Pseudo Code:

1. Import necessary libraries

2. Define function to parse the ASCII maze

3. Use a path-finding algorithm like Dijkstra's to solve the maze.
- Define starting point and ending point (S and E, not hash signs)
- Mark other coordinates as "visited" when they are encountered

4. Wait for the algorithm to finish its search.

5. Review the path to ensure correctness.

6. Return the answer in the format specified: <PATH_START> <path coordinates row1, column1>...<path coordinates rowN, columnN> <PATH_END>.

7. Print the answer to the terminal.

Let's implement the maze parsing function, assuming we are using Python:

```python
def parse_maze(input_string):
