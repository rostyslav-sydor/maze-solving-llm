To find a solution for the given maze, let's first determine the possible movements from the starting point. We can move either horizontally or vertically but not diagonally, and we cannot move into walls (represented by #).

From (1,1) (starting point), we can only move to the right which is (1,2).

Now, at (1,2), we can again only move to the right, which brings us to (1,3).

At (1,3), there's a wall to both the right and bottom, so we can't move further. Therefore, we must backtrack to (1,2) and check other options.

At (1,2), we've already tried moving to the right, so let's try moving down. This brings us to (2,2).

At (2,2), there's a wall above and to the right, so we can only move down to (3,2).

At (3,2), there's a wall above us and open space to the right. We can't move down because that would take us back to a position we've already been to. So, let's move to the right, (3,3).

At (3,3), we can't move up due to the wall, so let's move right to (3,4).

At (3,4), we can't move up or right because of the walls, so let's move down to (4,4).

At (4,4), we can't move up or right due to the walls, so let's move down to (5,4).

At (5,4), we can't move up because of the wall, and moving right brings us to a position we've already visited. So, let's move down to (6,4).

At (6,4), we can't move up due to the wall, and moving right brings us to a position we've already been to. So, let's move down to (7,4).

At (7,4), we can't move up because of the wall, and moving right brings us to a position we've already been to. So, let's move down to (8,
