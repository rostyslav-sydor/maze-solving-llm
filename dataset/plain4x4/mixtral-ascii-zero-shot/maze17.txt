 I need to firstly parse the provided data and convert it into a form my program could process. After analyzing the data, I can create a binary array that encodes different elements of the maze.

Let's assign the following binary codes for each of the sections:
0 - Wall
1 - Empty space
2 - Starting point
3 - Exit point

Using the above encoding, I can create the following binary array:
111111111
111000011
101110111
111100111
111111111
100100101
111011101
100000111
111111111

Now I have a manageable representation of the maze.

Next, the starting and ending points are known. For convenience, I will assign the variable "start" to (1,1) and "end" to (7,7). To determine the path from the start to the end, I can use standard pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.

Here's a rough pseudocode for a basic application of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the maze:

```
dist = {}  // Shortest path distance
prev = {}  // Predecessor in shortest path

for each vertex in grid:
    dist[vertex] = infinity
    prev[vertex] = null

dist[start] = 0
 hips = priority_queue()  // Nodes with lowest dist value has highest priority
 hips.insert((0, start))

while hips is not empty:
    (d, u) = hips.pop()
    if u == end: break
    for each neighbor v of u:
        alt = d + edge_weight(u, v)
        if alt < dist[v]:
            dist[v] = alt
            prev[v] = u
            hips.remove((dist[v], v))
            hips.insert((alt, v))

path = []
u = end
while u != start:
    path.add(prev[u])
    u = prev[
