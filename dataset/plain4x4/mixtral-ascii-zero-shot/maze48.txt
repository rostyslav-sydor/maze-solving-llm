Sure, I will solve the maze for you step by step using a recursive algorithm.

1. I will start from the entry point (1, 1).
2. Checking if the cell is clear or not by seeing the # symbol. If it's an empty space, then proceed. In this case, it's an empty space.
3. I will move to the right (1+1) (1, 2).
4. Checking the cell (1, 2)... It's an empty space. Move again to the right.
5. Checking the cell (1, 3)... It's a wall (#). Can't move further right, so I'll try to go down (1+1, 3).
6. Checking the cell (2, 3)... It's an empty space. Move down.
7. Checking the cell (3, 3)... It's a wall (#). Can't move further down, so I'll try to go left (3, 3-1).
8. Checking the cell (3, 2)... It's a wall (#). Can't move further left, so I'll try to go up (3-1, 2).
9. Checking the cell (2, 2)... It's an empty space. Move left.
10. Checking the cell (2, 1)... It's an empty space. Can move left.
11. Checking the cell (2, 0)... Not valid cell, so can't move further left, so I'll try up (1-1, 1).
12. Checking the cell (1, 1)... It's a wall. Can't go up, so I'll try down.
13. Checking the cell (1, 2)... It's a wall. Can't go down, so I'll try left.
14. Checking the cell (0, 2)... It's a wall. Can't go left, so I'll try right.
15. Checking the cell (1, 3)... It's a wall. Can't go right, so I'll try down.
