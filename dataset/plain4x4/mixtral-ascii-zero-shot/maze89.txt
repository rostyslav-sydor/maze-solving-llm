We can use depth-first search (DFS) to find a path between the entry point and the exit point in the maze. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start from the entry point (1, 1).
2. Check if you can move to any unvisited adjacent cell.
3. If there's an unvisited adjacent cell, add it to the path and make the move.
4. If there are no unvisited adjacent cells, backtrack to the previous cell in the path and check again.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the exit point or until there are no unvisited cells.
6. If you reach the exit point, output the path from the entry point to the exit point.

Now let's apply this strategy to your maze:

<PATH_START>
(1, 1)
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(1, 5)
(2, 5)
(3, 5)
(3, 6)
(3, 7)
(4, 7)
(4, 6)
(5, 6)
(5, 5)
(6, 5)
(7, 5)
(7, 6)
(7, 7)
<PATH_END>
