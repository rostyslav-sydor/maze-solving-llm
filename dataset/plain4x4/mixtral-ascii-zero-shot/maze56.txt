Here are the steps to solve the given maze (assuming we follow a simple algorithm like depth-first search or Dijkstra's algorithm for path finding):

1. Start at the entrance (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Look for the next unvisited position, which is either (1,2) or (2,1) in this case. Choose one of them and move to that position.
3. Repeat step 2, marking each position as visited, and backtracking as needed until you reach the exit (7,7).

Once the solution is found, we can output it as you requested between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. For example, if the solution path is: (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → 
(2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (6,3) → (7,3) → (7,4) → (7,5) → (7,6) → (7,7), the output would look like this:

"<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>"

Note: The actual solution path might differ depending on the algorithm used and the starting position.
