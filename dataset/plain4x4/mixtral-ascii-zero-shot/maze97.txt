The solution for the maze:

#########
#S  #   #
# # # # #
# # # # #
# ### ###
#   #   #
### ### #
#      E#
#########

is:

(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7)

The coordinate list for the solution between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START> (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) (4, 3) (4, 4) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 7) <PATH_END>

Let's think step by step:

1. Identify the start and end coordinates of the maze:
   - Start: (1, 1)
   - End: (7, 7)

2. Use an algorithm, like A* search or Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path between the start and end coordinates while avoiding walls.

3. Convert the solution path into a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

4. Output the solution:

<PATH_START> (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) (4, 3) (4, 4) (5, 4) (
