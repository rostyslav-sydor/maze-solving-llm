Our aim is to find a path from the entry point to the exit point by navigating through a maze, represented in ASCII format. To find a path, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

Here are some general steps:

1. Convert the ASCII representation into a graph data structure, consisting of nodes and edges.

2. Start the search from the entry point, represented by the letter 'S'. You can create a queue for BFS or a stack for DFS to track your search.

3. Expand the search from your current position. For each direction (e.g., up, down, left, and right), check if you are allowed to move in that direction (whether that direction has a wall or not) and try to explore the adjacent node.

4. If you can't move in the chosen direction or the adjacent node is already visited, skip to another direction until all four directions are tried.

5. Add visited nodes and their coordinates to the path. Make sure not to overwrite previous coordinates when you encounter a visited node.

6. Repeat step 3 until you either reach the exit point (letter 'E') or you have exhausted all possible directions from a node and there are no more nodes to visit.

7. Output the coordinates as a path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. Reminder: The path is represented in the format of (row, column) coordinates.

Here are some hints to consider:

- The maze is not symmetrical, so it might have more than one solution.
- Be mindful of checking for repeated moves due to loops in the maze, which may lead to an infinite loop.
- When you complete the path and reach the exit, you can simply trace back the visited nodes to find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.
- Confirm that in the initial ASCII representation of the maze, there is a valid path to move from point 'S' to point 'E'.
- In this case, the result might be a path length of 15: (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (5,4) (6,
