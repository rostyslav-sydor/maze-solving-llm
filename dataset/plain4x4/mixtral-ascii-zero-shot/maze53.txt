Starting from the entry point (1,1), we can visually trace a path to the exit point. Moving one cell right and two cells down, we can clearly see the shortest path, which is (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,5) → (6,5) → (6,6) → (6,7) → (7,7). Expressed in the required format, our path is `<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>`. 

Now let's generalize the process since it might be a bit too tedious to visualize it every time. A common way to solve a maze is through depth-first search or breadth-first search. In our case, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm seems appropriate. 

Breadth-First Search Algorithm:

1. Start at the maze's start point.
2. Keep track of the visited cells to avoid exploring the same cell twice and to avoid getting stuck in loops.
3. Add unvisited adjacent cells from our current location to a queue.
4. Take the next cell from the queue as our current cell and repeat steps 2 and 3 until we reach the destination.

Here's pseudocode we can follow to achieve our goal:

```python
def solve_maze(maze, start, end):
    visited = [[False] * len(maze[0]) for _ in range(len(maze))]
    steps = []
    queue = [(start, [])]

    while queue:
        (row, col), path = queue.pop(0)
        if row == end[0] and col == end[1]:
            return steps
        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0,
