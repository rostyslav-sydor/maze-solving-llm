To solve the provided ASCII representation of the maze, consider the following approach:

1. Define the relative position of the exit (E) and the total height and width of the maze.
   Exit position: (7, 7)
   Maze height: 9 rows (y-axis)
   Maze width: 10 columns (x-axis)

2. Represent the maze in a 2D array of characters with `'#'` as walls, `'S'` as the start, `' '` (space) as walkable paths, and `'E'` as the end.
   Sample mapping:

   ```python
   maze = \
   ["#########",   
    "#S  #   #",   
    "# ### # #",   
    "# #   # #",   
    "# # ### #",   
    "# #   # #",   
    "# ##### #",   
    "#      E#",   
    "#########"]
   ```

   Place holder for the positions that have been explored and added to the path so far.
   ```python
   visited = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
   ```

3. Define the valid directions to explore (up, down, left, right):
   ```python
   directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
   ```
4. Start from the start coordinate (1, 1) and iteratively populate the `visited` array based on the `directions`.
   To traverse in the maze, maintain a list of nodes with its respective (x, y) coordinates.
   Use a First-in, First-Out queue structure to efficiently explore the maze.
   ```python
   queue = collections.deque([(1, 1)])
   visited[1][1] = True
   while queue:
       current_x, current_y = queue.popleft()
       for dx, dy in directions:
           next_x, next_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
           if not (0 <= next_x < height and 0 <= next_y < width
