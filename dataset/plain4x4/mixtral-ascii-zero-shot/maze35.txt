To find a solution for the given maze, we need to find a path from the starting point to the exit point, avoiding the walls represented by # signs. Let's follow the path using depth-first search.

Step 1: Start at the entry point (1, 1)
Step 2: From (1, 1), we can only move right to (1, 2) and then right again to (1, 3)
Step 3: From (1, 3), we can only move down to (2, 3)
Step 4: From (2, 3), we can only move down to (3, 3)
Step 5: From (3, 3), we can only move right to (3, 4)
Step 6: From (3, 4), we can only move down to (4, 4)
Step 7: From (4, 4), there are no available moves, so we need to backtrack
Step 8: Backtrack to (3, 4) and move down to (4, 4) again
Step 9: From (4, 4), we move right to (4, 5)
Step 10: From (4, 5), we move right to (4, 6) and then down to (5, 6)
Step 11: From (5, 6), there are no available moves, so we need to backtrack
Step 12: Backtrack to (4, 6) and move down to (5, 6) again
Step 13: From (5, 6), we move down to (6, 6) and then right to (6, 7)
Step 14: Now we've reached the exit point at (7, 7) 

So the path from the entry point to the exit point is: <PATH_START> (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) (3, 4) (4, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 6) (6, 7) (7, 7) <PATH_END>
