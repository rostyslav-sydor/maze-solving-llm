In the given maze, you see one entrance at coordinate (1, 1) and one exit at coordinate (7, 7). To find a solution, let's begin with the start of the path at (1, 1). We want to consider neighboring grid cells to look for the shortest possible path to the destination. 

1. Start by creating a list for the path, updating it as we explore.
2. We can only move from one cell to an adjacent empty neighbor (where there isn't a # character)
3. At (1, 1), there are three possible empty neighbors: (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 1)
4. When two or more paths can lead to progress, let's select the one with the smallest Manhattan distance to the destination. In this case, path to (1, 2) looks the best with travel distance of 1 row and 1 column.
5. Now from (1, 2), the empty neighbors are (1, 3) and (3, 2).
6. Again, the travel distance to (1, 3) is shorter - (0, 1) - when compared to path to (3, 2). Let's move to (1, 3) and append it to our path list.
7. Continue this process to reach the destination, checking all empty neighbors and selecting the shortest path by distance as needed.
8. Eventually, our mountaineer will reach the exit at (7, 7).
9. In summary, the mountaineer will need to travel via path: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)... and finally, (7, 7).

Expressed as ASCII coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, the path would look like: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) ... (7,7) <PATH_END>

This process demonstrates how a checkpoint-based algorithm, such as A*, helps solve mazes by focusing narrowly on potential path segments that bring the mountaineer closer to the ultimate target - in this case, (7, 7). 

Final solution: 
<PATH_START> (1,1
