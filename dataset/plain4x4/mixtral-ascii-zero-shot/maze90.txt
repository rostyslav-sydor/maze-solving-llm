One approach is a simple Depth First Search from the initial position
```
coordinate (1,1) is not a wall, so mark it as visited, and explore its neighbour pixels
coordinate (0,1) is wall, so immediately backtrack
coordinate (2,1) is wall too, so still backed out
coordinate (1,0) visits neighbour pixels
coordinate (1,1) is visited, so kipping
coordinate (0,1) is wall
coordinate (1,2) visits neighbour pixels
coordinate (1,1) is visited, so kipping
coordinate (2,2) is wall
coordinate (1,3) is final E mark, so DFS found an answer: (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) is <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)\ <PATH_END>
