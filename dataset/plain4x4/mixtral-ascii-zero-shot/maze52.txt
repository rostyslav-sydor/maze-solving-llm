First, we need to identify the entry and exit points of the maze. In this case, the entry point is at coordinate (1,1) (according to the provided information), and the exit point is at coordinate (7,7).

Next, we need to analyze the maze and find a possible path from the entry point to the exit point. In this case, moving diagonally is not allowed since it would require crossing two walls simultaneously, making it impossible to do so in a 2D grid.

Starting from coordinate (1,1) and trying to reach the exit at coordinate (7,7), we can attempt to move horizontally and vertically through the maze. We cannot move across walls, which are represented by '#'.

By looking at the maze, a possible solution can be found:

1. Move 1 unit up: (1,1) -> (1,2)
2. Move 2 units right: (1,2) -> (3,2)
3. Move 1 unit up: (3,2) -> (3,3)
4. Move 3 units right: (3,3) -> (6,3)
5. Move 3 units down: (6,3) -> (9,3)
6. Move 1 unit left: (9,3) -> (9,2)
7. Move 1 unit up: (9,2) -> (9,3)

The final solution is as follows, in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as well:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (3,2) (3,3) (6,3) (9,3) (9,2) (9,3) <PATH_END>
