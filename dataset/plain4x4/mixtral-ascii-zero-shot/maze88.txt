First, let's identify the valid paths from the starting point (1,1). We can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

There are valid downward moves: (2,1)

Moving diagonally up-right: (1,2)

Now let's consider the paths from (1,2):

Up (1,1): visited
Down (2,2): wall
Up-left (0,1): not available (boundary)
Up-right (1,3): valid

Similarly, from (1,3):

Down (2,3): wall
Up-left (0,2): not available
Up-right (1,4): valid

From (1,4):

Down (2,4): wall
Up-right (1,5): valid

From (1,5):

Down (2,5): wall
Up-right (1,6): valid

Now, let's trace back the paths:

Starting at (1,6):

We came from (1,5)

From (1,5):

We came from (1,4)

From (1,4):

We came from (1,3)

From (1,3):

We came from (1,2)

From (1,2):

We came from (1,1)

Thus, the shortest path from (1,1) to (7,7) is (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) or
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) <PATH_END>.
