We need to analyze the maze and determine the optimal path from the entry to the exit points.

0. Identify the maze configuration
   The maze is a 9x9 grid, represented in ASCII format. The brackets in your question suggest you are using numbers as row and column indices. If so, then the input maze is this:

   #|0,0| (|,1| # |,2| # |,3| # |,4| # |,5| # |,6| # |,7| # |,8|
   |1,0| # |1,1| | | | | |  | |   | | # | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   |2,0| # |2,1| | # # # | | # | | | | | # # | | | | | | | | | | |
   |3,0| # |3,1| |  |  | # | | # | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   |4,0| # |4,1| # # # # # # | | # | | | | | | | # | | | | | | |
   |5,0| # |5,1| |  |  |  | # | # # # # | | # # | | | | | | |
   |6,0| # |6,1| # #  | #  # | | | | | | # # # | # | | | | |
   |7,0| # |7,1| # # |  |  | | # # | | # | # | # # | | | | |
   |8,0| # |8,1| # # # # # # # # | | # | | | | # | |

1. Determine the starting and ending points
   The starting point is in row 1, column 1; and the ending point is in row 7, column 7.

2. Find iterative solutions using the pathfinder algorithm, keeping in mind that diagonal and backward movement are not allowed.

 Following is the completion of the pathfinder:
