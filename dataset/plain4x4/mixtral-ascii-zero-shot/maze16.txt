Let's find a solution by applying Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point. In the ASCII maze, the 'S' represents the start, and the 'E' represents the end. We'll start from the entry point and explore the adjacent squares that are not walls until we reach the exit.

Iteration 1:
- Parent node: (1, 1)
- Expand to three adjacent squares: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2). No other squares are reachable yet because they are either blocked by a wall or are directly connected to an explored square.
    

Iteration 2:
- Parent node: (1, 2)
- Expand to adjacent squares: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2)
    

Iteration 3:
- Parent node: (2, 1)
- Expand to adjacent squares: (2, 0), (3, 1)
    
    
Iteration 4:
- Parent node: (2, 2)
- Expand to adjacent squares: (2, 3), (3, 3)
    
    
Iteration 5:
- Parent node: (1, 3)
- Expand to adjacent squares: No directly connected squares are available
    
    
Iteration 6:
- Parent node: (2, 3)
- Expand to adjacent squares: No directly connected squares are available
    
    
Iteration 7:
- Parent node: (3, 1)
- Expand to adjacent squares: No directly connected squares are available
    
    
Iteration 8:
- Parent node: (3, 2)
- Expand to adjacent squares: (3, 3), (4, 3)
    
   
Iteration 9:
- Parent node: (2, 0)
- Expand to adjacent squares: (2, 1), (3, 1)
    
    
Iteration 10:
- Parent node: (2, 3)
- Expand to adjacent squares: NOW adjacent squares of point
