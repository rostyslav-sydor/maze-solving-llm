Let's analyze the ASCII representation of the maze and form a list of valid coordinates.

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(1,2)
(1,3)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(4,3)
(5,3)
(6,3)
(6,4)
(6,5)
(6,6)
(7,6)
(7,7)
<PATH_END>

Having identified the valid coordinates, let's check any obstructions and unwanted loops among the path to provide a shorter list of coordinates, which can be considered a solution to the maze problem.

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(2,1)
(3,2)
(4,2)
(5,3)
(5,4)
(6,5)
(7,6)
(7,7)
<PATH_END>
