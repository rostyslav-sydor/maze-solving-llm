Okay, let's start analyzing the maze!

The maze's entry point is at row 1, column 1 (position S in the ASCII maze) and exit point is at row 7, column 7 (position E in the ASCII maze).

To find a solution, let's first walk through path possibilities:

1. We can choose to walk towards the first not marked with # character cell in the row 1.
2. We can choose to walk towards the first not marked with # character cell in the column 1.

Let's say we choose option 1 - walking towards the first not marked with # character cell in the row 1. 

The first not marked with # cell that we can reach is (1,8). 

Now, we got (1,8) cell and we need only translate that to a (row, column) form. Set row = 1 and column = 8. Now we have reached position (1,8).

Continuing with the same approach:

Let's try to walk to the first not marked with # character cell along the column 1 that we have not reached yet.

The cell that we will reach is (2,1).

Again, we translate that to a (row, column) form. Set row = 2 and column = 1. Now we have reached position (2,1).

Continuing with this approach, we can reach a few more cells. Listing them out in the (row, column) order from the ASCII maze representation:

(3,1), (4,1), (5,1)

We are not reaching the exit point by any of these paths. 

However, if we try the option 2 - walking towards the first not marked with # character cell in the column 1, we land at (7,2). 

Again, translating that into a (row, column) form: row = 7 and column = 2. Now we have reached position (7,2).

Continuing walking towards the exit point along that column, we reach two more cells. Listing them out in the (row, column) order from the ASCII maze representation:

(6,2), (5,2)
