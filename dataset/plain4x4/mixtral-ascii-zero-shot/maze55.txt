To find a solution for the given maze, we need to implement a pathfinding algorithm. Since we don't have any obstacles other than walls, we can use a simple algorithm like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Here, I will demonstrate the solution using DFS:

1. Convert the maze to a graph representation where nodes are empty spaces (spaces without 'S', 'E', or '#').
2. Perform DFS starting from the entry point (1, 1).
3. Track the visited nodes to avoid visiting them again.
4. If the DFS reaches the exit point (7, 7), we have found a solution.
5. Output the solution as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Run the following Python script:

```python
import queue

maze = "\n".join(
    [
        "#########",
        "#S      #",
        "####### #",
        "#     # #",
        "# ##### #",
        "# #     #",
        "# ##### #",
        "#      E#",
        "#########",
    ]
)

def convert_maze_to_graph(maze):
    graph = {}
    for row in range(len(maze)):
        for col in range(len(maze[0])):
            if maze[row][col] != "#":
                key = (row, col)
                graph[key] = []
                if row > 0 and maze[row - 1][col] != "#":
                    graph[key].append((row - 1, col))
                if col > 0 and maze[row][col - 1] != "#":
                    graph[key].append((row, col - 1))
                if row < len(maze) - 1
