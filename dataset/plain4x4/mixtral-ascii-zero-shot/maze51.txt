Okay, let's analyze the maze step by step. We can visualize the maze using the ASCII representation you provided:

```
#########
#S      #
# ##### #
# # #   #
### # ###
#   #   #
# ##### #
#      E#
#########
```

1. The starting position is at (1, 1), the 'S', and the exit is at (7, 7), the 'E'. Walls are marked with hash signs ('\#').

Now, from the 'S' location, we want to move in a direction according to how the walls are positioned. Move until you reach the exit or a wall. Here's an example solution:

```
 <PATH_START>
  (1, 1) -> move right (right is free since there are 5 spaces)
  (1, 2)
  (1, 3) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (2, 3)
  (3, 3) -> move left since the next position leads to a wall
  (3, 2)
  (3, 1) -> move up since the next position leads to a wall
  (2, 1) -> move right (right is free since there are 5 spaces)
  (2, 2)
  (2, 3) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (3, 3) -> move left since the next position leads to a wall
  (3, 2) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (4, 2) -> move right since the next position leads to a wall
  (4, 3) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (5, 3)
  (6, 3) -- move left since the next position leads to a wall
  (6, 2) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (7, 2) -> move right since the next position leads to a wall
  (7, 3) -> move down since the next position leads to a wall
  (8, 3)
  (9, 3)
  (10, 3)
