Let's think through the solution step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify the entry point of the maze - (1,1) starts with a letter "S".
2. Now let's try finding paths - we can move right and down from our current position.
3. We can't move right at (1, 1) due to the wall, so let's move down to (2, 1).
4. There are no possible paths on (2, 1) either, so let's move to (3, 1).
5. At (3, 1), we can move down to (4, 1) or right to (3, 2).
6. However, both of these directions are blocked by walls, so let's move to (5, 1) to explore a new path.
7. From here, we can move right to (5, 2) because there was a space.
8. From there, we can move three times to the right and reach the exit point - (5, 6).

Following this sequence, we can now state the solution:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) <PATH_END>
