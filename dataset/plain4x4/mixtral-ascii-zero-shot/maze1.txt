To solve the maze, we can use a simple algorithm called Depth-First Search (DFS). We will start from the entry point and explore the path in all possible directions (up, down, left, and right). If we encounter a location that we have already visited or a wall, we will backtrack until we find an unexplored location. If we reach the exit point, we will output the path. Here is an ASCII representation of the maze with the path marked with <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(1,2)
(1,3)
(1,4)
(1,5)
(1,6)
(1,7)
(2,7)  <---- Here is a backtrack because encountering visited node
(3,7)
(4,7)
(5,7)
(6,7)  <---- Here is another backtrack
(5,7)
(5,6)
(5,5)
(5,4)
(5,3)
(5,2)
(5,1)
(6,1)  <---- Here we are backtracking again
(5,1)
(4,1)
(3,1)
(2,1)
(2,2)

(7,4)
