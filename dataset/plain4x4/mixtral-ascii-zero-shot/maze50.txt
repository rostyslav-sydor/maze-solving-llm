We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting and ending coordinates:

1. Mark the starting coordinate (1,1) as the current node and add it to the list of visited nodes.
2. Get the neighboring coordinates of the current coordinate. For the starting coordinate, these are (1,2) and (2,1).
3. For each neighboring coordinate, check if it is a possible step and add it to the priority queue with a cost equal to the distance from the starting coordinate. Since we are currently at (1,1), the current cost for each neighboring coordinate is 1.
4. Get the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue and make it the current node.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end coordinate (7,7) is reached or until there are no more possible steps.

Let's start the algorithm:

1. Current node is (1,1) and the current cost is 0.
2. Neighboring coordinates are (1,2) and (2,1). Add them to the priority queue with a cost of 1.
3. The node with the lowest cost from the priority queue is (1,2), so make it the current node.
4. New neighboring coordinates are (1,3) and (2,2). Add them to the priority queue with a cost of 2.
5. The node with the lowest cost from the priority queue is (2,1), so make it the current node.
6. Neighboring coordinates are (1,1) and (3,1). We've already visited (1,1), so we do not add it to the priority queue again. Add (3,1) to the priority queue with a cost of 2.
7. The node with the lowest cost from the priority queue is (1,3), so make it the current node.
8. New neighboring coordinates are (1,4) and (2,3). We've already visited (2,3), so we do not add it to the priority queue again. Add (1,4) to the priority queue with a cost of 3.
9. The node with the lowest cost from the priority queue is (2,2), so make it the current node.
10. New neighboring coordinates are (1
