 To solve the maze, I will apply the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm:

1. Create a set to keep track of visited cells.
2. Create a stack to help with recursion.
3. Start with the entry point (row=1, col=1), mark it as visited, push it to the stack, and set its predecessor as None.
4. While the stack is not empty:
	 a. Pop a cell from the stack (current cell).
	 b. If the current cell is the exit point, we have found a path. Follow the predecessors back to the entry point to get the path coordinates.
	 c. Check all its possible neighbors (up, down, left, right) and visit any unvisited ones. Add the visited cells to the stack and set their predecessor as the current cell.
5. If at any point the stack becomes empty and the exit point hasn't been visited, then there is no path.

Let's implement this algorithm:
```php
function solveMaze(array &$maze, int $sRow, int $sCol, int $eRow, int $eCol): array {
    $rows = count($maze);
    $cols = count($maze[0]);
    $visited = array_fill(0, $rows, array_fill(0, $cols, false));
    $stack = [['row' => $sRow, 'col' => $sCol, 'prev' => null]];
    $visited[$sRow][$sCol] = true;

    while (!empty($stack)) {
        $curr = array_pop($stack);
        $row = $curr['row'];
        $col = $curr['col'];

        if ($row === $eRow && $col === $eCol) {
            $path = [];
            while ($curr !== null) {
                array_unshift($path, array($curr['row'], $curr['col']));
                $curr = $curr['prev'];
            }
            return ['path' => $path, 'success' => true];
        }

        $neighbors = [[$row - 1, $col], [$row + 1, $col], [$
