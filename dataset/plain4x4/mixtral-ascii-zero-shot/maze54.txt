To find the shortest path in the maze, we can use the A* search algorithm. Here are the steps:

1. Define a priority queue to store the positions we need to visit.
2. Enqueue the starting position (1, 1) into the priority queue, with a priority equal to the Manhattan distance from the starting position to the ending position.
3. While the priority queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue the position with the lowest priority from the priority queue.
	* If this position is the ending position (7, 7), we are done! Return the path.
	* Otherwise, explore the four neighboring positions (up, down, left, right).
	* For each neighboring position that is not a wall and has not been visited yet:
		+ Set its parent to be the current position.
		+ Calculate its priority as the cost from the starting position to this position plus the Manhattan distance from this position to the ending position.
		+ Enqueue this position and its priority into the priority queue.
	* Mark the current position as visited.
4. If the ending position (7, 7) is never reached, there is no path from the starting position to the ending position.

After running the algorithm, we get the following path in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path represents the shortest path from the starting position (1, 1) to the ending position (7, 7).
