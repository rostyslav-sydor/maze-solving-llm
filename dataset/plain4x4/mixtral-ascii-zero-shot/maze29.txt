First, let's try to identify the possible movements from the entry point and to the exit point. We can move either to the right or to the down side recursively.

Let's start with the movement to the right:

1. From (1, 1), we can move to the right first, which leads to (1, 2).

Now check if movement is possible to the right or down:

2. From (1, 2), we cannot move to the right anymore since it's blocked by '##'. So let's move down to (2, 2).

3. From (2, 2), moving to lower row will bring us to (3, 2).

4. From (3, 2), moving right will bring us to (3, 3).

5. From (3, 3), we can move down which leads to (4, 3).

6. From (4, 3), we can move down again to (5, 3).

7. From (5, 3), we cannot move down further since it's blocked by '##'. However, we can move to the right, leading to (5, 4).

8. From (5, 4), the only possible move remaining is down to (6, 4).

9. From (6, 4), the only possible move is to the right going to (6, 5).

10. From (6, 5), we cannot move down anymore, however we can move right to (6, 6).

11. Finally, from (6, 6), we found the exit at (7, 7). 

Please output the path coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Let's check the solution visually:
