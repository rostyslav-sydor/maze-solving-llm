Let's consider the ASCII maze and solve it step by step.

First, let's define the initial state of the maze:

```
#########
#S#     #
# # #####
# #     #
# ### # #
#   # # #
### ### #
#      E#
#########
```

Initial state:

```
 
# => {"L": None, "R": None}
D => {"L": None, "R": {"D": None}}
L => None
R => {"D": None}
```

We start at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0), marked as 'S'. The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (row 7, column 7), marked as 'E'. The walls are represented by '#' characters, and empty spaces represent walkable areas.

We need to find a path from 'S' to 'E' while avoiding walls. Let's use the following directions to navigate the maze:

* `U`: Up
* `D`: Down
* `L`: Left
* `R`: Right

Next, let's apply the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path:

1. Initialize the queue with the starting position ('S').
2. While the queue is not empty:
	1. Get the front element of the queue.
	2. Check if it is the goal position ('E'). If yes, retrieve the path and exit the loop.
	3. Remove the element from the queue.
	4. Mark the current position as visited.
	5. Add the neighboring positions to the queue only if they are not visited and valid.
3. If the queue becomes empty without finding the goal position, there is no valid path.
4. Return the path (if found) or indicate that no path exists.

Using the Breadth-First Search algorithm, we can find the shortest path in the given maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (6,2) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5
