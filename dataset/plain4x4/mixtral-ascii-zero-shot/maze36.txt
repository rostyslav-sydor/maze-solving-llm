Step 1: First, we need to understand how maze solving algorithms work. There are various methods, but two popular ones are depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

Step 2: In the provided maze, start from the entrance (1,1). We can follow these directions initially: RRU (Right, Right, Up) to reach the point (3,3). From this point, we can continue exploring the maze following the same directions (in order of priority): Right (R), Down (D), Left (L), and Up (U).

Step 3: The first location we can move to from (3,3) is (3,4), following the direction R (Right). Now, there's no possible movement in this direction, so we go to the next direction, which is D (Down).

At (4,4), the next place we can move to is (4,3) following the direction L (Left).

At (4,3), there are no movement options in any direction other than going back to (4,4) in direction L (Left). Notice that we have reached the same point as before, so we should not proceed in this direction. Instead, we return to point (4,4).

In (4,4), we must move following the direction U (Up), as all possible moves in the other directions lead to the current point.

Continue exploring the maze in a similar way until we reach the exit point (7,7).

Step 4: The path in the format of coordinate list would be <PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,4) (7,4) (7,3) (7,2) (7,1) (7,0) <PATH_END>

Please note that you may need to adjust the solution based on your specific implementation of the pathfinding algorithm. With this example, you can now research a specific maze-solving algorithm and implement it for your use case.

There are open-source maze-solving libraries available, like astar and python-maze, which could facilitate the implementation of your solution.
