Step 1: Create a list to store the path.
Step 2: Create a function to find the starting position.
Step 3: Create a function to find the neighboring cells.
Step 4: Create a function to recursively search for the exit.
Step 5: Call the search function with the starting position.
Step 6: Check if the exit has been found, and if so, return the path.
Step 7: Print the path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
Let's start with step 1.
