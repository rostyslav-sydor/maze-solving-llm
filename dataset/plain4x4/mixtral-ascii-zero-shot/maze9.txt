Here's a possible approach:

1. Convert the ASCII representation to a data structure that represents the maze, like a 2D array or using a graph representation.
2. From the S (start) coordinate, try out each coordinate around S, one by one, and see if it's a valid (not wall) coordinate.
3. For each valid coordinate found in step 2, take the next step and follow the same process: check all surrounding coordinates.
4. Do this process recursively till the E (end) coordinate is found or all coordinate possibilities have been exhausted.
5. Collect and order the coordinates from the first step to the last step. This will provide the solution for the maze.

 Here's the output with a coordinate list in the format you requested:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
Note that this is just one possible solution. There could be multiple ways to solve this maze, depending on how you choose coordinates to explore at each step.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions.
