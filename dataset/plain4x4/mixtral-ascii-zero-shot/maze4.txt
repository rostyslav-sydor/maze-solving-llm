Here is how we can find the path:

1. Start at the entrance (1,1).
2. Look around to find possible directions to move. Potential options are up (1,0), down (1,2), left (0,1) or right (2,1).
3. Only moving right is possible since there is no wall at (2,1).
4. Move to (2,1) and repeat the process.
5. Now the possible directions are up (1,1), down (3,1) and right (2,2), but we can only move right.
6. Continue this process until you reach the exit at (7,7).

After following these steps, the path in the specified format would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
