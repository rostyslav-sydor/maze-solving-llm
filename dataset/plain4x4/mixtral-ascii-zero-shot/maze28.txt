To find the solution, we need to perform a pathfinding algorithm such as the Depth-First Search (DFS) or the Breadth-First Search (BFS). Let's use the BFS algorithm for our purpose. Here are the steps:

1. Create a queue data structure and enqueue the starting position.
2. Set the starting position as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    a. Dequeue the front element from the queue.
    b. Check the neighboring cells of the dequeued position.
    c. If a neighboring cell is not a wall and not visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
    d. If a neighbor is the exit position, return the path.
    e. Continue checking neighboring cells until all neighbors have been processed.
4. If the exit position is not found, return that no path exists.

Now, let's implement the algorithm for our maze:

<PATH_START>
(1, 1) (adjacent to) (1, 2)
(1, 2) (adjacent to) (1, 3)
(1, 3) (adjacent to) (2, 3)
(2, 3) (adjacent to) (3, 3)
(3, 3) (adjacent to) (4, 3)
(4, 3) (adjacent to) (5, 3)
(5, 3) (adjacent to) (5, 4)
(5, 4) (adjacent to) (6, 4)
(6, 4) (adjacent to) (7, 4)
(7, 4) (adjacent to) (7, 5)
(7, 5) (adjacent to) (7, 6)
(7, 6) (adjacent to) (7, 7) Exit found at (7, 7)
<PATH_END>

So, the solution path to reach the exit is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4)
