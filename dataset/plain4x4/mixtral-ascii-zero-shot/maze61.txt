Let's first define the start and end positions:

Start = (1, 1)
End = (7, 7)

Next, we need to determine the possible moves from each position. A valid move is when the position is not a wall (#).

From the start position (1, 1), we can move right (1, 2).
From position (1, 2), we can move right (1, 3) or down (2, 2).
From position (1, 3), we can move down (2, 3).

Continue this process until you reach the end position (7, 7). Keep track of the path taken by storing the coordinates in a list.

Once you reach the end position, the list of coordinates will be the solution to the maze.

Now let's use this step-by-step process to solve the maze:

<PATH_START>
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 5) (6, 5) (6, 6) (7, 6) (7, 7)
<PATH_END>
