To solve the maze provided in the last prompt, we need to parse the adjacency list to understand the connections between the nodes in the graph, which represent the coordinates of the maze. We start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). Here is the processed adjacency list for quick reference using the given data:

Adjacency List:
- (0,0) connects to [(1,0), (0,1)]
- (1,0) connects to [(1,1)]
- (1,1) connects to [(1,2)]
- (1,2) connects to [(1,3), (2,2)]
- (1,3) connects to [(0,3), (2,3)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)]
- (2,2) connects to [(1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,3), (2,2), (3,1)]
- (3,3) connects to [(3,2), (2,3)]
- (2,3) connects to [(1,3), (3,3)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,0), (2,2)]
- (2,0) connects to [(1,0), (2,1), (3,0)]
- (3,0) connects to [(3,1), (2,0)]
- (3,1) connects to [(3,0), (3,2)]

Now let's find a path using the connections between the nodes:

1. Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) using connection between (0,0) and (1,0).
2. Move from (1,0) to (2,0) using connection between (1,0) and (2,0).
3. Continue from (2,0) to (3,0) using connection between (2,0) and (3,0).
4. Travel from (3,0) to (3,1) using connection between (3,0) and (3,1).
5. Navigate from (3,1) to (3,2) using connection between (3,1) and (3,2).
6. Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3) using connection between (3,2) and (3,3).

By following these connections, we have a path from (0,0) to (3,3) across the maze grid.

Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
