To solve the maze and find the correct path from the origin to the target, given that the maze is described as an adjacency list and the maze data is:

<ADJLIST_START> (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (0,1) <--> (1,1) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (3,1) <--> (2,1) ; (1,3) <--> (0,3) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; <ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> 
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

We can follow these steps:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. The adjacency list path options from (0,0) lead to (1,0) and (0,1).
3. Continue to trace the path keeping track of valid movements through the connecting points that lead towards the target (3,3). Avoid going back to previously visited nodes.

Solution path from this trace:
- Start at (0,0).
- Go right to (0,1).
- Move to (1,1) from (0,1) as (0,0) and (1,0) have been considered and carried to dead ends or backtracking.
- Continue from (1,1) to (1,2).
- Progress from (1,2) to (1,3).
- Then from (1,3), go to (2,3).
- Move down from (2,3) to (3,3) which is the target.

Therefore, the path for this maze from the start to the target is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
