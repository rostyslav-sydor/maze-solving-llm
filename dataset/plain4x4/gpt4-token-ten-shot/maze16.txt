To find a path through the maze described by the adjacency list in the provided information, we need to analyze the given connections between the vertices of the graph (where vertices are points in a coordinate grid).

Let's reconstruct the graph from the list and then use a pathfinding algorithm to determine the path from the origin to the target. Given the structure and the constraints, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm will be efficient because it finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs, ensuring all horizontal and vertical moves have equal "cost".

### Reconstruction of the Graph:

**Adjacency List**:
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)

**Origin**: (0,0)
**Target**: (3,3)

### Pathfinding using BFS Algorithm:

1. **Start** at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all adjacent nodes that can be reached from (0,0).
3. Enqueue each unvisited node and mark as visited. Also, store the path leading to each node.
4. Dequeue the next node and repeat the exploration.
5. If the target (3,3) is reached during the exploration, return the path that led to it.
6. If the queue is exhausted before reaching the target, conclude that no path is possible (in a fully connected maze, this shouldn't happen).

Performing BFS using the given adjacency list from the starting point (0,0):

- Starting at (0,0), directly connected: (1,0), (0,1)
- From (0,1): (0,2) 
- From (0,2): (0,3)
- From (0,3): (1,3)
- From (1,3): (2,3)
- From (2,3): (3,3) - Reached the target.

**Solution Path**:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Hence, the solution for the maze with this specific origin and target would be:

**Solution**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
