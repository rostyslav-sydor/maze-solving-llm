To solve the maze given in the adjacency list form, we need to determine a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). To achieve this, we should incorporate a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) that finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Given the adjacency list, we must navigate through the allowable passages to reach the destination. Let's analyze the adjacency list and apply BFS to find the path:

Adjacency List Interpretation:
<ADJLIST_START>
(3,3) <--> (3,2) 
(0,2) <--> (0,3) 
(1,0) <--> (2,0) 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) 
(3,0) <--> (3,1) 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) 
(1,3) <--> (1,2) 
(2,3) <--> (1,3) 
(2,1) <--> (2,0) 
(1,0) <--> (0,0) 
(1,3) <--> (0,3) 
(1,1) <--> (0,1) 
(2,3) <--> (3,3) 
(3,2) <--> (2,2) 
(0,1) <--> (0,0) 
<ADJLIST_END>

<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Solution using BFS:

1. Start at origin (0,0).
2. From (0,0), move to adjacent nodes: (1,0) and (0,1).
3. From (1,0), continue to (2,0).
4. From (2,0), move to (2,1).
5. From (2,1), go to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), progress to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), finally navigate to the target (3,3).

Thus, the path through the maze from the origin to the target would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

In this solution path, nodes are visited level by level, ensuring the shortest path in the unweighted maze graph is found.
