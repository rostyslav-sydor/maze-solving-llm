In order to solve this maze, let's evaluate the adjacency list provided and trace the path from the origin to the target using basic graph traversal techniques, ensuring that all connections (edges) between adjacent coordinates (nodes) are properly accounted for. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS), a common algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this.

Maze adjacency list details:
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)

Origin and Target:
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)

**Solution Finding using Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all accessible nodes: (0,1).
3. From (0,1), explore (0,0) and (0,2).
4. From (0,2), continue to (0,3).
5. At (0,3), you can go to (1,3).
6. Continue from (1,3) to (1,2).
7. From (1,2) to (1,1), and from (1,1) to (1,0).
8. From (1,0), move to (2,0).
9. From (2,0), move on to (3,0).
10. Continue from (3,0) to (3,1).
11. From (3,1) to (3,2).
12. From (3,2) directly to (3,3).

Now, gathering these steps into the solution format:

**Solution:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path efficiently moves from the origin to the destination, traversing through all necessary nodes as per the adjacency list provided.
