To find a path through the maze described by the adjacency list, we need to traverse the maze graph from the origin to the target by following the edges that connect nodes (coordinates). The mazes and solutions provided show the nodes and their connectivity.

Given the adjacency list:
```
<ADJLIST_START> (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (0,2) <--> (1,2) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (0,1) <--> (1,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; <ADJLIST_END>
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

**Mapping the Connectivity:**
- The node `(0,0)` is connected to `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`.
- The node `(3,3)` is connected to `(2,3)`, `(3,2)`.

**Potential Path Calculation:**
- Starting from the origin `(0,0)`, the potential paths to explore are `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`.
- From `(0,1)`, explore further to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, explore further to `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`.
- From `(1,2)`, move to `(0,2)`, `(1,3)`.
- Continuing from `(1,3)`, move to `(2,3)`.
- From `(2,3)`, move to `(3,3)` which is the target.

Thus, the solution that finds a path to the target `(3,3)` is as follows:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Here we noticed the available nodes from the adjancy list and created a path that connects the origin to the target through a valid sequence of moves. Each move should be valid within the described connections.
