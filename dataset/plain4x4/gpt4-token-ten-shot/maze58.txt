To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided.

Here's the adjacency list analysis for the relevant paths:

- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

This allows us to construct the following path from the origin to the target:

**(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)**

Given this information, the solution in the required format would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This confirms the maze connectivity from the starting point to the endpoint through a series of traversable links.
