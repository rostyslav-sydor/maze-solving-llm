To solve this maze represented by the provided adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,3), we need to create a graph representation and search for a viable path. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for this.

The adjacency list is parsed as:
<ADJLIST_START> 
(1,0) <--> (1,1); 
(2,0) <--> (3,0); 
(0,3) <--> (1,3); 
(0,1) <--> (0,0); 
(0,2) <--> (0,1); 
(3,3) <--> (3,2); 
(2,1) <--> (1,1); 
(1,0) <--> (0,0); 
(1,2) <--> (2,2); 
(1,3) <--> (2,3); 
(0,2) <--> (0,3); 
(3,2) <--> (3,1); 
(2,1) <--> (3,1); 
(3,1) <--> (3,0); 
(2,3) <--> (2,2);
<ADJLIST_END> 

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)

We'll construct the graph as a dictionary where keys are coordinates and values are sets of directly connected nodes. Next, we'll use BFS to find the shortest path. Here's a rough setup of BFS:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Check each connection from the current node.
3. Record the node if hasn't been visited and enqueue it for further exploration.
4. Retrace the steps when the target is found to backtrace the path.

After parsing the list and conducting BFS, let's sketch out the possible path findings.

Solution:
Given the configuration, a feasible path could be traced as:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

When realized following the connections:
- From (0,0), move to (1,0)
- From (1,0), move to (1,1)
- From (1,1), move to (2,1)
- From (2,1), move to (3,1)
- From (3,1), move to (3,2)
- From (3,2), move to (3,3)

This path derives from the visibility of available moves and identifies the feasible strategic steps to move from the origin to the target. 

Output the result as required:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
