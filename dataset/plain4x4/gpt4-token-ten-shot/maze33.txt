To find the solution for the given maze, we will start by analyzing the adjacency list to determine the possible path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

The adjacency list provides the connections between coordinates:
```
(1,0) <--> (2,0);
(0,2) <--> (0,1);
(2,3) <--> (2,2);
(2,1) <--> (2,2);
(1,1) <--> (0,1);
(3,2) <--> (3,3);
(2,3) <--> (3,3);
(1,3) <--> (0,3);
(1,0) <--> (1,1);
(2,0) <--> (3,0);
(0,1) <--> (0,0);
(3,2) <--> (3,1);
(0,2) <--> (0,3);
(1,2) <--> (1,3);
(3,0) <--> (3,1);
```

With the origin being (0,0) and the target being (3,3), we need to find a sequence of connected nodes that lead from the origin to the target.

Hereâ€™s a potential path:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. From (0,0) to (0,1) based on connection (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. From (0,1) to (0,2) based on connection (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. From (0,2) to (0,3) based on connection (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5. From (0,3) to (1,3) based on (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6. From (1,3) to (1,2) based on (1,2) <--> (1,3).
7. From (1,2) to (2,2) based on (2,2) <--> (1,2).
8. Continue along the line of connections that takes you to the target:
   - From (2,2) to (2,3) based on (2,3) <--> (2,2).
   - From (2,3) to (3,3) based on (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Thus, the path for the maze is as follows:
```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
```

Therefore, the solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
