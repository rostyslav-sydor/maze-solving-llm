To find the solution for the second maze, we follow a similar process of tracing connections from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Given the constructed graph from the adjacency list, we construct the path to follow:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3)
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3)
5) Move down from (1,3) to (2,3)
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path provides a direct step-by-step route from the origin to the target, utilizing the connections specified in the maze's adjacency list.
