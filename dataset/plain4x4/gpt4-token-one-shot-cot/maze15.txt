Given the maze and its entry (origin) and exit (target) points, we can construct a solution based on the adjacency list provided.

From origin (0,0) to target (3,3), following the provided connections:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1).
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2).
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3).
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3).
5) Move left from (1,3) to (1,2).
6) Move left from (1,2) to (1,1).
7) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1).
8) Move down from (2,1) to (3,1).
9) Move right from (3,1) to (3,2).
10) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3).

Given the series of movements, the path traversed in coordinates:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path guides you from the origin to the target through valid transitions based on the adjacency list, encompassing the solution to the maze challenge.
