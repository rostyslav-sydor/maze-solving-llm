To solve the maze, we start from the origin (0,0) and seek a path to the target (3,3) following the adjacency list provided. Here is the solution path traced:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1).
2) Move down from (0,1) to (1,1).
3) Move down from (1,1) to (1,2). 
4) Move right from (1,2) to (1,3).
5) Move right from (1,3) to (2,3).
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3).

The path from start to finish will therefore be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
