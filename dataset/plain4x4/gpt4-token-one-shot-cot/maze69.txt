To solve the maze using the provided adjacency list, we observe the connections and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) From (0,0) move right to (0,1)
2) From (0,1) move (0,2)
3) From (0,2) move to (1,2)
4) From (1,2) move down to (2,2)
5) From (2,2) move to (2,3)
6) From (2,3) move down to (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
