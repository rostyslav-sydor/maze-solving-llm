To find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) for the second maze, follow these steps based on the adjacency list provided:

1) Start at (0,0).
2) Move right to (0,1).
3) Move right to (0,2).
4) Move right to (0,3).
5) Move downward to (1,3).
6) Move downward to (2,3).
7) Move downward to (3,3).

Here, we can see that there's a direct path mostly moving in the row itself and then dropping down columns strategically as per the adjacency links.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
