To solve the provided maze, we must trace a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using the adjacency list to understand the connections between the points:

1. Start at (0,0) and move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), continue to (2,2).
5. Next, move from (2,2) to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), move to (3,3), which is the target.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
