To navigate through this maze, we must find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Following the connections in the adjacency list, here is the path to move from the origin to the target:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) - is connected
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) - is connected
3) Move down from (0,2) to (1,2) - is connected
4) Move right from (1,2) to (2,2) - is connected
5) Move down from (2,2) to (3,2) - is connected
6) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3) - is connected

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
