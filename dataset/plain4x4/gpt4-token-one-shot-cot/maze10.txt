To solve this maze, we need to find a path connecting the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) by analyzing the provided adjacency list:

1) Start at (0,0).
2) Move right to (0,1), as connected by (0,0) <--> (1,0) and (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3) Move right to (0,2), following (0,1) <--> (0,2).
4) Move right to (0,3), following (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5) Move down to (1,3), following (0,3) <--> (1,3).
6) Move left to (1,2), as connected by (1,2) <--> (1,3).
7) Move left to (1,1), as connected by (1,1) <--> (0,1) and (1,1) <--> (1,2).
8) Move down to (2,1), moving from (2,0) to (2,1).
9) Move right to (2,2), as connected by (2,2) <--> (1,2) and (2,2) <--> (2,3).
10) Move right to (2,3), following (2,2) <--> (2,3).
11) Move down to (3,3), as connected by (3,3) <--> (2,3) and (3,3) <--> (3,2).

Each movement respects the adjacency pairs given. Here is the path represented in the correct format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
