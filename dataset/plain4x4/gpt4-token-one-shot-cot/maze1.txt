To solve the maze:

1) Start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3)
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3)
5) Move down from (1,3) to (2,3)
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3)

The solution path traced is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
