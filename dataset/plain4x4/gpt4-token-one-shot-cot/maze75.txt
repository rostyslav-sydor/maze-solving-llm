To solve the maze from the given adjacency list, we begin at the origin and make our way to the target by transitioning through connected points:

1) Start at (0,0)
2) Move to (1,0)
3) Proceed to (1,1)
4) Next, travel along to (1,2)
5) Continue to (1,3)
6) Head towards (2,3)
7) From there, go to (2,2)
8) Move down to (2,1)
9) Then journey to (2,0)
10) Head down further to (3,0)
11) Proceed right to (3,1)
12) Move right again to (3,2)
13) Finally, reach the target at (3,3).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
