To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). Using the adjacency list information, we can track a path through the connected nodes.

Here's how the solution works, tracing from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) From (0,0), go right to (0,1).
2) From (0,1), go right to (0,2).
3) From (0,2), go right to (0,3).
4) From (0,3), go down to (1,3).
5) From (1,3), go down to (2,3).
6) From (2,3), go right to (3,3).

Combining these moves, we get:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
