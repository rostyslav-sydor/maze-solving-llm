To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided.

From the adjacency list:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0) directly connected
- Move to (2,0) directly connected
- Move to (3,0) directly connected
- Move to (3,1) directly connected
- Move to (3,2) directly connected
- Move to (3,3) directly connected

Thus, the path in coordinate format from the start to the end is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is the most direct path given that from each step the next step is directly reachable without any detours.
