To solve this maze, using the adjacency list provided, we can trace a path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) by following the connections:

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3)
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3)
5) Move left from (1,3) to (1,2)
6) Move left from (1,2) to (1,1)
7) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1)
8) Move right from (2,1) to (3,1)
9) Move down from (3,1) to (3,2)
10) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
