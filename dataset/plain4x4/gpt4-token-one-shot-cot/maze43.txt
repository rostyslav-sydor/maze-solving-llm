To solve the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by analyzing the adjacency list, we need to trace a viable path through connected vertices:

1. Start from (0,0).
2. Follow to (0,1), connected as per the adjacency list.
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2), which is also directly connected.
4. Go to (1,2), reachable from (0,2).
5. Continue to (2,2) from (1,2).
6. Head to (3,2), which is connected to (2,2).
7. Finally, move to (3,3) from (3,2).

Thus, the path from the origin to the target crosses: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), and ends at (3,3).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
