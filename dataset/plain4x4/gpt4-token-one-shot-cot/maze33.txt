To solve the maze, we need a placement and adjacency list visualization of the adjacency list provided:

We need to move from (0,0) to (3,3) by following adjacent accessible points.

- From (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (0,2)
- From (0,2) to (0,3)
- From (0,3) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (1,2) (and potentially back to) (1,1) and then again to (1,0)
- From (1,0) move to (2,0), 
- From (2,0) to (3,0)
- From (3,0) to (3,1)
- From (3,1) to (3,2)
- From (3,2) to (3,3).

This makes a complete path from the origin to the target in the maze. The path sequence in coordinates will be: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
