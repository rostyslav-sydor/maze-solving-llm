To solve the maze represented in the adjacency list format, follow the most direct path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) Move up from (0,2) to (1,2)
4) Move up from (1,2) to (1,3)
5) Move up from (1,3) to (2,3)
6) Continue up from (2,3) to (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
