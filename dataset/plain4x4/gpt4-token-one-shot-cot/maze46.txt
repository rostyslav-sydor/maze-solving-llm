To find the solution for the maze provided, we follow the path from the starting node (0,0) to the ending node (3,3) using the adjacency list to navigate between nodes that are directly connected. Below is the solution, breaking down the path navigated through the maze:

1) From (0,0) move to (0,1)
2) From (0,1) move to (0,2)
3) From (0,2) move to (0,3)
4) From (0,3) move to (1,3)
5) From (1,3) move to (2,3)
6) From (2,3) move to (2,2)
7) From (2,2) move to (2,1)
8) From (2,1) move to (2,0)
9) From (2,0) move to (3,0)
10) From (3,0) move to (3,1)
11) From (3,1) move to (3,2)
12) From (3,2) move to (3,3)

The coordinates of the successive nodes along the path from the entry to the exit points are as follows:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
<PATH_END>
