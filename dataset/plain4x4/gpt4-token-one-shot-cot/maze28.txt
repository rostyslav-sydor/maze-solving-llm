To solve this maze, we will find a route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided:

1. From (0,0) move right to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) move right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) move right to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) move down to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) move down to (2,3).
6. From (2,3) move right to (3,3).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
