To solve the maze with the given adjacency list and the specified entry (origin) and exit (target) points, we first construct a path by navigating through available connections considering the entry (0,0) and the exit (3,3):

1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) 
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3)
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3)
5) Move down from (1,3) to (2,3)
6) Move down from (2,3) to (3,3)

Thus, the path from entry to exit is represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
