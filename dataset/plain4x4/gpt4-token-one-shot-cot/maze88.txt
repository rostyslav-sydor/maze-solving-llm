To solve the maze from the point (0,0) to the point (3,3), we follow the path inferred from the adjacency list provided:

**Steps to Solution:**
1. Start at (0,0), move right to (0,1).
2. Continue right to (0,2).
3. Move up from (0,2) to (1,2).
4. Move right from (1,2) to (1,3).
5. Go up from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. Continue to (3,3).

**Formatted Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path directly connects the origin to the target within the maze, following the valid adjacent linked nodes.
