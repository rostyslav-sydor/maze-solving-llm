To solve the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I analyzed the adjacency list provided and mapped out a path through the graph.

Steps to solve:
1. Start at (0,0). Move to the adjacent node (0,1).
2. From (0,1), continue to its adjacent node (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), move to (1,1).
7. From (1,1), move to (1,0).
8. From (1,0), move to (2,0).
9. From (2,0), move to (2,1).
10. From (2,1), move to (2,2).
11. From (2,2), move to (2,3).
12. From (2,3), move to (3,3).

Hence, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
