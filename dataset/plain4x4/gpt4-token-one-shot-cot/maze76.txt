To solve the maze, we start from the origin (0,0) and use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the target (3,3). Using BFS is advantageous here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target, it has done so using the shortest possible path through the adjacency list.

Following the BFS algorithm process on the given adjacency list:

1) Start from the origin (0,0).
2) From (0,0), move to (1,0) using (0,0) <--> (1,0).
3) From (1,0), proceed to (2,0) using (2,0) <--> (1,0).
4) From (2,0), go to (3,0) using (3,0) <--> (2,0).
5) From (3,0), move right to (3,1) using (3,0) <--> (3,1).
6) From (3,1), go to (3,2) using (3,1) <--> (3,2).
7) From (3,2), reach the destination (3,3) using (3,3) <--> (3,2).

The path in terms of coordinates:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This direct path follows the adjacency relationships given, using each connected pair to efficiently navigate through the maze from the start point to the end point.
