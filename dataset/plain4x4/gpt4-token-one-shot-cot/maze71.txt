For solving the maze described by the adjacency list, we will trace a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

1) Start at (0,0).
2) Move right to (0,1).
3) Continue right to (0,2).
4) Move right to (0,3).
5) Go down from (0,3) to (1,3).
6) Continue down to (2,3).
7) Move left from (2,3) to (2,2).
8) Go down from (2,2) to (3,2).
9) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3).

Here is the description in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
