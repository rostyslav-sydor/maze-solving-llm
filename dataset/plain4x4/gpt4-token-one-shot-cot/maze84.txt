To solve the provided maze, we first interpret the adjacency list to identify the connections between each coordinate, and then find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Based on the adjacency list, the following steps lead to the target:

1) Start at (0,0), move right to (0,1).
2) Move right again from (0,1) to (0,2).
3) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3).
4) Move down from (0,3) to (1,3).
5) Move left from (1,3) to (1,2).
6) Move left from (1,2) to (1,1).
7) Move left from (1,1) to (1,0).
8) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0).
9) Move right from (2,0) to (2,1).
10) Move right from (2,1) to (3,1).
11) Move right from (3,1) to (3,2).
12) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3).

Thus, the coordinates in order arriving at the target are:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
