To find a solution to the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list and determine the connections between various coordinates in the maze. The entry point is at (0,0), and the exit point is at (3,3). We need to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the connections provided. Hereâ€™s a suggested path based on the adjacency list:

1) Start at (0,0).
2) Move to the connected (1,0).
3) Continue to (2,0), which is connected to (1,0).
4) Progress from (2,0) to (2,1).
5) Head to (1,1) from (2,1) which aligns, knowing (1,1) is associated with ((0,1)).
6) Travel to (0,1), then proceed to (0,2).
7) Move from (0,2) to (0,3).
8) Head to (1,3) from (0,3).
9) Proceed to (2,3), which connects to (1,3).
10) Move to (3,3), as it connects to (2,3).

Following this path outline, we navigate through the maze and approach all important points, completing at the exit. This pattern ensures the correct pathway is taken based on the adjacency definitions provided.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
