To solve the maze given, we will trace a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using the provided adjacency list to determine the possible movements. Here is the pathway, step by step:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1), supported by (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Continue right to (0,2), supported by (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. Keep heading right to (0,3), supported by (0,3) <--> (0,2).
5. Go down to (1,3), connected by (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6. Move further down to (2,3), demonstrated by (2,3) <--> (1,3).
7. Head left to (2,2), linked by (2,3) <--> (2,2).
8. Continue to (3,2), supported by (3,2) <--> (2,2).
9. Finally, move right to (3,3), connected by (3,3) <--> (3,2).

The steps to exit from the origin to the target can be encoded as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
