To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Based on the adjacency list, we can build the steps to traverse through the maze.

1) Start at (0,0)
2) Move right to (0,1)
3) Move right to (0,2)
4) Move up to (1,2)
5) Move up to (2,2)
6) Move down to (3,2)
7) Move left to (3,1)
8) Move left to (3,0)
9) Move up to (2,0)
10) Move right to (2,1)
11) Move right to (2,3)
12) Move down to (3,3), the target point

Here is the list of coordinates forming the path from the origin to the destination:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
