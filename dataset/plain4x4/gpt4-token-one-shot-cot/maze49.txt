To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we must find a sequence of connected nodes that form a route from start to finish without retracing steps. 

Hereâ€™s one possible solution:
1) From (0,0) move right to (0,1).
2) From (0,1) move right to (0,2).
3) From (0,2) move right to (0,3).
4) From (0,3) move down to (1,3).
5) From (1,3) move down to (2,3).
6) From (2,3) move right to (3,3).

These steps provide a continuous route from the start node to the end node in the maze.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
