To find the solution for the maze, we'll use Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used pathfinding algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start by creating a set of unvisited nodes, add the start node (S) with a distance of 0, and mark all other nodes as unvisited with a distance of infinity.
2. While the set of unvisited nodes is not empty:

   a. Choose the node in the unvisited set with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.
   b. Update the distance value of each unvisited neighboring node by adding the distance between the current node and the neighbor and comparing it with the neighbor's current distance.
   c. If the updated distance for a neighbor is smaller than its current distance, update the neighbor's distance and its predecessor (so we know how it was reached).

3. Once the target node (E) is marked as visited or there are no more unvisited nodes, backtrace the path from the target node to the start node using the predecessor information.

Here's the maze with distance values and predecessors for each node:

```
  0 48 49  7 48
S ### # ### #
### # ### # 4
# # #   # # 4
# ##### # 4 4
# #   # # 4 4
# # # # # 4 4
#   #  E# 4 4
  4 48 49  4 4
```

Now let's backtrace the path, starting from the target (E) and going backwards to the start (S):

<PATH_START> (7, 7) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 1) (5, 1) (4, 1) (3, 1) (2, 1) (1, 1) <PATH_END>

The output above represents a path following the coordinates for each position visited, starting from the Entry point (row 1, column 1). This is a solution path to the maze from starting
