Create a random maze instead. It could be any size. Entry point must be (1,1) and exit point must be near to the right bottom */

Here is an ASCII representation of a randomly generated maze:

###########
#S   ### # #
#   #  # # #
# # # ### #
# # # #  ##
# #     # #
# # # ### #
# #   #    #
#   #      #
# # # # ####
### #   E ##
###########

The maze's entry point is at coordinate (1, 1) (Letter S), and the exit point is at coordinate (9, 8) (Letter E). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Please find a solution for this maze and output it in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as well, where first coordinate is row and second coordinate is column
 
Please note that because this maze is dynamically generated, the path may differ from the path provided in this example

For example: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

Considering the maze you generated, do you think there exists a shorter path that you have not provided between points S and E?
