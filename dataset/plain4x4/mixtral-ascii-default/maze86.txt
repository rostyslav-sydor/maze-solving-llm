Here is a solution to the given ASCII maze:
```
<PATH_START>
(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7)
<PATH_END>
```
To navigate from the entry point at (1,1) to the exit point at (7,7) using this path:

1. Start at (1,1)
2. Move to (1,2)
3. Move to (2,2)
4. Move to (3,2)
5. Move to (3,4)
6. Move to (4,4)
7. Move to (5,4)
8. Move to (6,4)
9. Move to (6,6)
10. Move to (7,6)
11. Move to (7,7)

This path will lead the user from the starting point to the exit point.
