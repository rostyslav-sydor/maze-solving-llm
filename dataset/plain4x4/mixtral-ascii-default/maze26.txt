 Here is my analysis and listing of the shortest path:

1. Maze sizes (rows and columns): (13, 10)
2. Entrance location: (1, 1)
3. Exit location: (7, 7)
4. The shortest path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 7) <PATH_END>
