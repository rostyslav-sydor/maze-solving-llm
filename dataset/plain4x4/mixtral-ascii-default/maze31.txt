Here is an ASCII representation of the maze and its solution:

#########
#S^>v   #
### #####
#_>^<   #
# ##### #
#<_>^< #
# ### # #
#<_>^  E#
#########

The path is: <PATH_START> (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7) <PATH_END>
This solution represents the path from the start (S) to the end (E) in the maze, taking the directions represented by the arrows as: 
- ^ for going up,
- > for going right,
- < for going left,
- v for going down.
Empty spaces in the path represent when no direction arrow is needed, as the path continues straight in the same direction.
