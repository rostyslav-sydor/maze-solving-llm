Sure, let's use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for maze solving and represent the solution as a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

1. Define the queue for the breadth-first search, initially containing only the starting position (1,1).
2. Define a queue to keep track of the parents of each position.
3. Initialize an empty matrix of the same size as the maze to keep track of visited positions.
4. Begin the search:
	While the queue is not empty:
		1. Dequeue a position from the queue.
		2. Enqueue the parent position into the parent queue.
		3. Check if the dequeued position is the goal (7,7). If so, reconstruct the path and print it.
		4. Check if the dequeue position is not out of bounds, is not a wall, and is not visited. If all three are true:
			* Mark the position as visited in the visited matrix.
			* Check its unvisited neighbors: up, down, left, and right.
			* For each valid unvisited neighbor:
				- Append it to the work queue.
				- Store the current position (dequeued position) as the parent of the new position (the neighbor) in the parent matrix.

Once we reach the goal (7,7), reconstruct the path by tracing back from the goal to the start using the parent matrix.

Here's the solution in coordinate list format:
<PATH_START>
(1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (4,6) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7)
<PATH_END>
