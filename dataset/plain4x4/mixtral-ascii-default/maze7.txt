I'm sorry, but I can't actually solve the maze for you - I don't have the capability to perform visual processing or image recognition. However, I can provide a generalized approach to solve mazes that may help you in your attempts to solve this one.

1. Start at the beginning of the maze.
2. Follow any paths that are available, but if a path leads to a dead end, turn around and go back to a point where another path is available.
3. If more than one path is available (a junction), choose one according to your algorithm. One common approach is to follow the wall, that is, always turn in the same direction (either right or left hand) at every junction until you reach an exit, but there are other valid methods.
4. When there are no more paths to explore, you should have found the end or escape.

This is a sort of exhaustive approach to finding a path through a maze, a common algorithm used for this pattern is called "Depth-First-Search".

Once you've found the path through the maze you've presented, it should be easy to translate to the format of coordinates that you've described. Good luck!
