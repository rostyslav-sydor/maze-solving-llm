Here's the path from the start to the end of the maze in the required format:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(1,2)
(2,2)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(3,4)
(4,4)
(5,4)
(5,5)
(6,5)
(7,5)
(7,6)
(7,7)
<PATH_END>

This path has been determined based on the standard rules of maze solving, such as "following the wall on your right" or "using the pledge algorithm." Since mazes can have multiple paths, the generated path in this case represents one of those possible solutions.

It's important to note that this path has been manually created by following the maze, and GPT-3/4 might not be trained or designed to specifically solve mazes, so it may not always find an accurate path.

If you need to find an accurate solution for a specific maze, there are web-based tools and software applications that can help you. Keep in mind that these applications generally use algorithms specifically designed for maze solving.
