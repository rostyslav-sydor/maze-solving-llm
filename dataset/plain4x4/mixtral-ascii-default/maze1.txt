To solve the given ASCII maze, we can use a simple path-finding algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Both algorithms will work, but for the purpose of this explanation, we will use the DFS algorithm.

First, let's define the state space and the actions that we can take within the maze. The state space will be the coordinates of the cells in the maze, and the actions will be the possible movements from one cell to its neighboring cells.

1. Start at the entry point (1, 1) and add this coordinate to the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty:
	* Pop a coordinate from the stack. Let's call it the current position.
	* Check if the current position is the exit point. If it is, we have found the solution. Terminate the algorithm and return the solution.
	* Otherwise, check all valid neighboring cells of the current position. Valid neighboring cells are those that are within the maze, not a wall, and not visited yet.
	* For each valid neighboring cell, add the coordinate to the stack and mark the cell as visited.
	* Repeat steps 2-4 until the stack is empty or a solution is found.
3. If the stack is empty and no solution is found, there is no path from the entry point to the exit point.

Here's a pseudo-code solution for DFS in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_path(maze, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    stack = deque([start])
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True
    path = []

    while stack:
        row, col = stack.pop()
        path.append((row, col))

        if (row, col) == end:
            return path

        neighbors = [(row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1)]
        for r, c in neighbors:
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0
