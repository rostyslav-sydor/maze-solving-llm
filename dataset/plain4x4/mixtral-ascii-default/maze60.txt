To solve the maze, we can use a recursive backtracking algorithm. Here is the list of coordinates between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens for the solution:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(1,2)
(2,2)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(4,3)
(4,2)
(5,2)
(5,3)
(5,4)
(4,4)
(4,5)
(3,5)
(2,5)
(2,6)
(3,6)
(4,6)
(4,7)
(5,7)
(6,7)
(7,7)
<PATH_END>

This solution will lead the player from the entrance at (1,1) to the exit at (7,7).
