Essentially, you're looking for the path a user should take through a maze. Here is an experimental solution using a depth-first search algorithm to find a path through the maze in Python. This code could be further optimized for performance, but I hope it illustrates the basic idea:

```python
from collections import deque

def solve_maze(maze, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])

    def is_valid(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and maze[r][c] != "#"

    stack = deque([(start[0], start[1])])
    visited = set()
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # right, left, down, up

    while stack:
        r, c = stack.popleft()
        visited.add((r, c))

        if (r, c) == end:
            break

        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc

            if is_valid(new_r, new_c) and (new_r, new_c) not in visited:
                stack.append((new_r, new_c))

    path = []
    current_position = end

    while current_position != start:
        path.append(current_position)
        current_position = (current_position[0] - directions[3][0], current_position[1] - directions[3][1])

    path.append(start)

    # Reverse the path to display in the correct order
    path = path[::-1]

    # Converting to (row, col) format for clarity
    path = [(coord[0][0], coord[1][1]) for coord in path]

    return path


maze = [
    "#########",
    "#S  #   #",
    "# # ### #",
    "# #     #",
    "# ##### #",
