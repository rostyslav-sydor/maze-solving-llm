To find a solution for the given maze, we'll need to provide the coordinates list between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with the start point at (1,1) and the end point at (7,7). Here's a solution using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:

Before describing the algorithm, here's the solution:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(2,1)
(3,1)
(3,2)
(4,2)
(4,3)
(3,3)
(2,3)
(2,4)
(3,4)
(4,4)
(5,4)
(6,4)
(6,5)
(6,6)
(7,6)
(7,7)
</PATH_END>

Now, let's go through the steps of the algorithm:

1. Start at the entry point (1,1), which is indicated by the 'S'. This is our initial position.
2. Create a stack data structure to store cell coordinates (row, column) we've visited or need to explore.
3. Enqueue the entry point (1,1) into the stack.
4. Repeat the following steps until the stack is empty:
	* a. Dequeue a cell (row, column) from the stack.
	* b. Check the surrounding cells to find the next possible move. Our possible moves are up, down, left, and right.
	* c. If the move is within the maze boundaries (0 <= row < 8, 0 <= column < 8) and the cell isn't a wall (#), check if the cell is the exit point (7,7) and if not, enqueue the new cell to the stack.
	* d. If the cell is the exit point (7,7), end the algorithm; otherwise, continue visiting cells until the stack is empty.

After following these steps, the path from (1,1) to (7,7) is printed out in between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

I hope you find this helpful! Now, let's work through the solution step-by-step to understand
