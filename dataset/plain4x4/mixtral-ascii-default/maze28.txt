Let's start at the entry point (1,1). 

1. Looking at the given grid, we can see there's no wall to the right, so we can move to coordinate (1, 2).
2. Now, we need to decide where to go. To the right, there's a wall. To the left, there's also a wall. So, let's consider going down.
3. There's no wall below (1, 2), so we can move down to coordinate (2, 2). Now, we have to make a decision.
4. At coordinate (2, 2), there's a wall to the right and below. So, let's consider going up.
5. At coordinate (1, 2), there's a wall to the right. So, let's consider going left.
6. Coordinate (1, 1) has our starting point, but here, we just made a loop, and went back to the beginning. 
Let's undo this and return to coordinate (2, 2).
7. At coordinate (2, 2), we only have the option to go left.
8. Coordinate (1, 2) is not a good option as we have already been there, and we made a loop. So, let's continue to the left towards coordinate (3, 2).
9. At coordinate (3, 2), we can only go down.
10. At coordinate (4, 2), let's go down.
11. At coordinate (5, 2), let's go down.
12. At coordinate (6, 2), let's go down.
13. At coordinate (7, 2), let's go right.
14. At coordinate (7, 3), let's go right.
15. At coordinate (7, 4), let's go down.
16. At coordinate (8, 4), let's go right.
17. At coordinate (8, 5), let's go up.
18. At coordinate (7, 5), let's go right.
19. At coordinate (7, 6), let's go right.
20. At coordinate (7, 7
