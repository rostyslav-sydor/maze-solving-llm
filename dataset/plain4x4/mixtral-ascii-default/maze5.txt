Since we prefer solutions that humans would come up with, I would suggest following these steps:

- Find the maze entry point.
- Explore the maze by going straight and turning right when encountering a wall.
- After reaching the end, retrace the steps based on the metrics established in the process of exploration.

Considering the maze problem presented above, the solution path (in human steps) is as follows:
(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6) -> (1,7) -> (1,8) -> (2,8) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (6,7) -> (7,7) (exit)

And, here is the output represented in the format requested:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) (2,8) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
