In order to generate and output a solution for the given maze, one could develop a pathfinding algorithm, such as the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm or the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Here's a demonstration of how Breadth-First Search could be implemented to solve this maze:

1. Define a MazeSolver class that contains details about the maze, such as its size, entry point, exit point, walls, and blank spaces.
2. In the MazeSolver class, create a private method that implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
3. Within the Breadth-First Search method, create a queue to store the coordinates of the spaces that need to be explored.
4. Initialize the queue with the coordinate of the entry point.
5. Set the coordinate of the entry point as visited.
6. Use a while loop to continue solving the maze until the queue becomes empty.
7. Within the while loop, dequeue the next space to be explored (i.e., its coordinate) from the queue.
8. For each neighboring coordinate of the dequeued coordinate, perform the following:
   a. If the neighbor is the exit point, terminate the search as the solution has been found.
   b. If the neighbor is a blank space that isn't marked as visited, mark it as visited, add it to the queue, and update a parent dictionary to track which neighbor coordinate belongs to which coordinate. This dictionary will help us reconstruct the path later.
9. If the queue is empty without visiting the exit point, there is no solution to the maze.
10. Reconstruct the path starting from the exit point and looking up corresponding parents in the parent dictionary until reaching the starting point. 
11. Convert the reconstructed path to a flattened list of coordinates and insert it between the "<PATH_START>" and "<PATH_END>" tokens before returning it as a string.

Here's an example of how the path for this maze might be represented:

<PATH_START>
(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 7) ->
(2, 7
