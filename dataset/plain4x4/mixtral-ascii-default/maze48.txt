I have considered the highlighted entries as commands rather than the actual output since they represent actionable instructions. Here's a solution to find the path from the starting point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7) of the maze:

<PATH_START>
(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7),
(2,7),
(3,7),
(4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3),
(5,3),
(6,3),
(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)
<PATH_END>

Keep in mind that (7,7) is the top right corner, not the bottom right corner, in the ASCII representation of the maze. Hope this helps!
