To solve the given maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm:

1. Add the starting point (1, 1) to a queue and mark it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a coordinate (row, col) from the front of the queue and check its neighbors (up, down, left, right) to determine if any of these neighbors are unvisited valid spaces (not a wall) inside the maze.
3. For each valid and unvisited neighbor: add it to the back of the queue and mark it as visited. Also, add the neighbor's coordinates to the path after the dequeued coordinates.
4. Check if any neighbor is the exit point (7, 7). If so, add the coordinates of the exit point to the path after the dequeued coordinates from step 2 and end the search.
5. Once the queue is empty and the exit point is not found, there is no solution.

Here is the solution for the provided maze:

(5, 3)
(5, 4)
(5, 5)
(6, 5)
(7, 5)
(7, 6)
