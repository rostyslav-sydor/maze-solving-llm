 To generate a solution path for the provided maze, we can use a backtracking algorithm or the A* algorithm, as they are suitable for solving problems like this. I will solve it using a depth-first search backtracking algorithm, which will help us to find a valid path from the start to the exit. Please note that this solution may not be the shortest path, though it will be a valid one.

Here's the solution path in the format specified:

<PATH_START>
(1,1)
(1,2)
(2,2)
(3,2)
(3,3)
(4,3)
(4,4)
(5,4)
(5,5)
(5,6)
(6,6)
(6,7)
(7,7)
<PATH_END>

Please keep in mind that there might be more than one solution, depending on the algorithm you decide to use. The solution above is just one of the possible paths obtained using a depth-first search backtracking algorithm.
