Note: The (x,y) coordinates are row-wise, starting from the top-left, with (1,1) being the entry point in your example. For the sake of simplicity, the solution is depicted as a straight line, but it may not be the optimal path. A more sophisticated algorithm, such as A* (A-star), could be used to find the shortest path in the maze, taking into account wall locations and distance to the exit.
