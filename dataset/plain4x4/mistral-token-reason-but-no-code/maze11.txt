To solve a maze represented as an adjacency list, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This is a recursive algorithm that will visit the target node, if there is a path from the origin to the target in the maze.

Here are the steps to implement the Depth-First Search algorithm:

1. Start at the origin node.
2. Check if the current node is the target node. If it is, then a path exists, and we can stop the search.
3. Otherwise, mark the current node as visited and recursively call DFS on each unvisited neighbor of the current node.
4. If a path to the target node is found, then return the path.
5. If no path is found, then return an empty path, indicating that no path exists from the origin to the target in the maze.

Now, let's apply the Depth-First Search algorithm to the given maze:

<ADJLIST_START> (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (1,3) <--> (0,3) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (1,1) <--> (1,0) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

The solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In the above solution, the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,3), which is the target node. The path goes through the nodes (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), and finally (3,3). This path indicates a possible route to navigate through the maze from the origin to the target.

I hope this analysis helps you understand the process of solving a maze using the Depth-First Search algorithm.
