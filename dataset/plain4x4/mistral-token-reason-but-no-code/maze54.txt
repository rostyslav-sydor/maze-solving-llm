To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS starts at the origin, explores all the neighboring nodes, and then moves on to the next level of neighbors until it finds the target. This approach ensures that the first solution found will be the shortest path.

Here's how we can apply BFS to solve the maze:

1. Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.
2. Add the origin to the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue the current node from the queue.
	* If the current node is the target, construct the path by backtracking from the target to the origin and return the path.
	* Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node.
4. If the target is not found, return an empty path.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start at the origin (0, 0).
2. Enqueue neighboring nodes: (0, 1), (1, 0).
3. Dequeue (0, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 2).
4. Dequeue (1, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 1), (2, 0).
5. Dequeue (0, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 3).
6. Dequeue (1, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 2), (2, 1).
7. Dequeue (2, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 1), (3, 0).
8. Dequeue (0, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 3).
9. Dequeue (1, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 3), (2, 2).
10. Dequeue (2, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 2), (3, 1).
11. Dequeue (3, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 1).
12. Dequeue (1, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3).
13. Dequeue (2, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3), (3, 2).
14. Dequeue (3, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 2).
15. Dequeue (2, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 3).
16. Dequeue (3, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: None.
17. Dequeue (3, 3), which is the target.
18. Construct the path by backtracking from the target to the origin: (3, 3) <-- (2, 3) <-- (2, 2) <-- (1, 2) <-- (1, 1) <-- (0, 1) <-- (0, 0).

The solution is: <PATH_START> (3, 3) (2, 3) (2, 2) (1, 2) (1, 1) (0, 1) (0, 0) <PATH_END>
