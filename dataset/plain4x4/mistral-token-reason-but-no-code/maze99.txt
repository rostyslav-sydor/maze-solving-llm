To find a solution for the given maze, we can apply the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, which is a powerful graph traversal technique that can be used to explore all the possible paths in the maze. Here's a step-by-step reasoning on how we can apply DFS to find a solution:

1. Start at the origin (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Check if the current position is the target (3, 3). If yes, we have found the solution, and we can stop.
3. If the current position is not the target, explore the adjacent unvisited positions. For each neighbor, repeat the process from step 2.
4. If there are no more unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the previous position.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until either the target is found, or all positions have been visited without finding the target.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This is the shortest path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3) in the given maze.
