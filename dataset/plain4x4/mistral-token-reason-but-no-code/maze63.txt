To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS will visit all the nodes of the graph by going as deep as possible into the graph, and then backing up when no more nodes can be visited at the current level. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Check the adjacent nodes of the current node. In this case, the adjacent node is (0, 1).
3. Move to the adjacent node (0, 1) and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each new node until you reach the target point (3, 3).
5. If the target point (3, 3) is reached, then we have found a solution.
6. If the target point is not reached, backtrack to the previous node and repeat steps 2-5 for the next unvisited adjacent node.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start at (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to (0, 1) and mark it as visited.
3. Move to (0, 2) and mark it as visited.
4. Move to (0, 3) and mark it as visited.
5. Move to (1, 3) and mark it as visited.
6. Move to (1, 2) and mark it as visited.
7. Move to (1, 1) and mark it as visited.
8. Move to (1, 0) and mark it as visited.
9. Move to (2, 0) and mark it as visited.
10. Move to (3, 0) and mark it as visited.
11. Move to (3, 1) and mark it as visited.
12. Move to (3, 2) and mark it as visited.
13. Move to (3, 3) - the target point is reached, and we have found a solution.

The final path is: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3)

Outputting the solution in the required format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
