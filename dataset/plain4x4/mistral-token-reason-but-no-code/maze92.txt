To solve the maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can use BFS to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here's the reasoning behind using BFS:

1. BFS explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level. This ensures that we find the shortest path to the target.
2. BFS uses a queue data structure to store the nodes to be visited. This allows us to process the nodes in the order they are discovered, which is crucial for finding the shortest path.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize an empty queue and a visited In order to find a solution for the given maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This algorithm will explore the maze by going as far as possible along each path before backtracking.

To implement the DFS algorithm, we will start from the origin point (0,0) and mark it as visited. Then, we will recursively explore all its connected nodes that haven't been visited yet. If we reach the target point (3,3), we've found a solution, and we can return the path. Otherwise, we backtrack and explore other paths.

Here's the pseudocode for the DFS algorithm:

```
function DFS(current_node, target_node, path):
    if current_node == target_node:
        return path + [current_node]
    for neighbor in current_node's unvisited neighbors:
        mark neighbor as visited
        result = DFS(neighbor, target_node, path + [current_node])
        if result is not None:
            return result
    return None
```

Now let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start from (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore its unvisited neighbors: (0,2).
3. Mark (0,2) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (0,1), (1,2).
4. Mark (0,1) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (1,1).
5. Mark (1,1) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (1,0).
6. Mark (1,0) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (2,0), (0,0).
7. (2,0) is a valid move, so mark it as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (3,0).
8. Mark (3,0) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (3,1).
9. Mark (3,1) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (3,2).
10. Mark (3,2) as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors: (3,3).
11. We've found the target point (3,3), so return the path: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

So the final output for the solution to the given maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
