To find a solution for the given maze, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. To implement DFS, we will create a recursive function that takes the current node (cell in the maze) and the path so far as inputs.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the DFS algorithm works:

1. Start from the origin (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Check the neighboring cells of the current cell. If a neighboring cell is not visited and is not a wall, recursively call the DFS function with the neighboring cell as the current cell and add the neighboring cell to the path.
3. If the current cell is the target (3,3), then print the path and return.
4. If the current cell has no unvisited neighbors, then backtrack by removing the current cell from the path and returning to the previous cell.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all cells are visited or the target is found.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

Starting from the origin (0,0), we can go to (0,2) since it is not a wall and not visited yet. Then, we can go to (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and finally reach the target (3,3).

So, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Note: This solution assumes that the maze is a perfect graph, meaning that all cells are connected and there are no isolated cells or subgraphs. If the maze has multiple connected components, you may need to run the DFS algorithm from multiple starting points to find a solution.
