To solve the given maze, we can follow the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm traverses through the maze, starting from the origin point, and explores all possible paths in a layer-by-layer fashion. The BFS algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path to the target if it exists.

Here's how we can apply the BFS algorithm to solve the given maze:

1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes. Enqueue the origin point and mark it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the current node from the queue.
   b. Check if the current node is the target point; if it is, return the path from origin to target.
   c. For each neighbor of the current node:
      i. If the neighbor is not visited and not an obstacle:
         - Enqueue the neighbor and mark it as visited.
         - Update the parent pointer for the neighbor to the current node.
3. If the target point is not found, return an empty path.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

```
<ADJLIST_START> (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

After running the BFS algorithm on the given maze, we find the path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3):

```
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (1, 1) (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
```
