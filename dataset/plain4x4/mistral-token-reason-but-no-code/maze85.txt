To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a graph search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is useful for solving mazes and finding connected components in a graph.

Here's the reasoning behind using DFS for this problem:

1. DFS is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding a path in a maze.
2. It explores all possible paths from the starting point until it reaches the target point.
3. If the target point is unreachable, DFS will backtrack and explore other paths.
4. Once the target point is reached, DFS can trace back the path it took to get there.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0).
2. Explore the neighboring points and add them to the stack: (1, 0), (0, 1).
3. Pop (1, 0) from the stack and explore its neighbors: (2, 0), (1, 1).
4. Pop (2, 0) from the stack and explore its neighbors: (3, 0).
5. Pop (3, 0) from the stack and explore its neighbors: (3, 1).
6. Pop (3, 1) from the stack and explore its neighbors: (3, 2).
7. Pop (3, 2) from the stack and explore its neighbors: (3, 3) (target point).
8. Trace back the path from the target point to the origin point: (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).

The solution path for the given maze is:
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
