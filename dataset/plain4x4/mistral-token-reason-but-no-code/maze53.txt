To solve the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Here's the reasoning behind using DFS for solving the maze:

1. We start from the origin (0,0) and explore the adjacent nodes (neighbors) that are not visited yet.
2. If the adjacent node is the target (3,3), we have found a solution, and we can output the path between the origin and target.
3. If the adjacent node is not the target, we recursively explore its neighbors.
4. If we reach a dead-end or have visited all the neighbors, we backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring other branches.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. We start from the origin (0,0).
2. The neighbors of (0,0) are (1,0) and (0,2).
3. We choose (1,0) and explore its neighbors.
4. The neighbors of (1,0) are (0,0) and (2,0).
5. We have already visited (0,0), so we explore (2,0).
6. The neighbors of (2,0) are (1,0) and (3,0).
7. We have already visited (1,0), so we explore (3,0).
8. The neighbors of (3,0) are (2,0) and (3,1).
9. We have already visited (2,0), so we explore (3,1).
10. The neighbors of (3,1) are (3,0) and (3,2).
11. We have already visited (3,0), so we explore (3,2).
12. The neighbors of (3,2) are (3,1) and (2,2).
13. We have already visited (3,1), so we explore (2,2).
14. The neighbors of (2,2) are (2,3) and (3,2).
15. We have already visited (3,2), so we explore (2,3).
16. The neighbors of (2,3) are (2,2) and (1,3).
17. We have already visited (2,2), so we explore (1,3).
18. The neighbors of (1,3) are (2,3) and (0,3).
19. We have already visited (2,3), so we explore (0,3).
20. The neighbors of (0,3) are (1,3) and (0,2).
21. We have already visited (1,3), so we explore (0,2).
22. The neighbors of (0,2) are (1,2) and (0,0).
23. We have already visited (1,2) and (0,0), so we backtrack to (0,3).
24. We have already visited all the neighbors of (0,3), so we backtrack to (1,3).
25. We have already visited all the neighbors of (1,3), so we backtrack to (2,3).
26. We have already visited all the neighbors of (2,3), so we backtrack to (2,2).
27. We have already visited all the neighbors of (2,2), so we backtrack to (3,2).
28. We have already visited all the neighbors of (3,2), so we backtrack to (3,1).
29. We have already visited all the neighbors of (3,1), so we backtrack to (3,0).
30. We have already visited all the neighbors of (3,0), so we backtrack to (2,0).
31. We have already visited all the neighbors of (2,0), so we backtrack to (1,0).
32. We have already visited all the neighbors of (1,0), so we backtrack to (0,0) and choose the other neighbor (0,2).
33. The neighbors of (0,2) are (1,2) and (0,0).
34. We have already visited (1,2) and (0,0), so we backtrack to (0,2).
35. We have already visited all the neighbors of (0,2), so we backtrack to (0,0).
