To find a solution for this maze, we need to start from the origin point and move through the adjacency list, checking if we can reach the target point. Since this is a graph represented as an adjacency list, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Let's use BFS, as it is more efficient for finding the shortest path in a graph. We will start from the origin point and add it to a queue. At each step, we will remove a coordinate from the queue, check if it's the target point, and if not, we will add all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet to the queue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the BFS algorithm for this maze:

1. Initialize an empty queue and add the origin point (0,0) to it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
	a. Remove a coordinate from the queue and store it in a variable, let's call it current.
	b. If current is the target point (3,3), we've found the solution, break the loop.
	c. Otherwise, add all neighbors of current that haven't been visited yet to the queue.
3. After the loop ends, check if the target point was reached. If so, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target point to the origin point.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Initialize an empty queue and add the origin point (0,0) to it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
	a. Remove a coordinate from the queue: (0,0).
	b. Since (0,0) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (0,1) and (1,0) to the queue.
	c. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (0,1).
	d. Since (0,1) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (1,1) and (0,2) to the queue.
	e. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (1,0).
	f. Since (1,0) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (2,0) to the queue.
	g. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (0,2).
	h. Since (0,2) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (1,2) to the queue.
	i. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (1,1).
	j. Since (1,1) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (2,1) to the queue.
	k. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (2,0).
	l. Since (2,0) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (3,0) and (1,0) to the queue.
	m. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (1,2).
	n. Since (1,2) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (2,2) to the queue.
	o. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (2,1).
	p. Since (2,1) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (3,1) and (1,1) to the queue.
	q. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (2,2).
	r. Since (2,2) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (3,2) and (1,2) to the queue.
	s. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (3,0).
	t. Since (3,0) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (2,0) to the queue.
	u. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (3,1).
	v. Since (3,1) is not the target point (3,3), add its neighbors (2,1) to the queue.
	w. Repeat step 2a with the next coordinate from the queue: (2,3).
	x. Since (2,
