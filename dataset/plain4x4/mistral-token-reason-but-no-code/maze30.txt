The given maze is represented as a graph using an adjacency list. The goal is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) by traversing the connected tokens in the adjacency list.

Reasoning:
To navigate from the origin point to the target point, we need to find a path that connects the two points and avoids any dead ends or loops. We can achieve this by implementing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph. In this case, we'll use DFS as it is more suitable for this problem.

1. Initialize an empty stack to store the path.
2. Start at the origin point (0,0).
3. Push the origin point onto the stack.
4. Visit the current node (the one at the top of the stack).
5. Check if the current node is the target point (3,3). If so, we've found the path, and we can print the contents of the stack.
6. If the current node is not the target point, look for its neighbors in the adjacency list.
7. For each neighbor that has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and push it onto the stack.
8. If there are no more unvisited neighbors, pop the current node off the stack and return to step 4.
9. Continue this process until the stack is empty or we've found the target point.

Now, let's apply this reasoning to solve the specific maze:

<ADJLIST_START>
(0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (1,1) <--> (1,0) ; (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (2,2) <--> (2,1) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0)
<ADJLIST_END>
