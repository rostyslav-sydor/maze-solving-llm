To solve the given maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search algorithm. In this case, let's use Dijkstra's algorithm. The reasoning behind using Dijkstra's algorithm is that it is a simple and efficient way to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.

Here's a brief overview of the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. Start by initializing the distance of the source node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
2. Mark the source node as visited.
3. Find the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes and mark it as visited.
4. Update the distances of all unvisited neighbors of the current node by adding the distance from the source to the current node.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all nodes have been visited or the target node has been found.

Now, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given maze:

1. The source node is (0,0), and the target node is (3,3).
2. Initialize the distance of node (0,0) to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
3. Mark node (0,0) as visited.
4. The unvisited neighbors of node (0,0) are (1,0), (0,1), and (0,2). Update their distances:
   - (1,0): distance = 1
   - (0,1): distance = 1
   - (0,2): distance = 1
5. Find the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes, which is node (1,0), (0,1), and (0,2). Mark the first one (1,0) as visited.
6. The unvisited neighbors of node (1,0) are (1,1) and (2,0). Update their distances:
   - (1,1): distance = 2
   - (2,0): distance = 2
7. Find the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes, which is node (0,1) and (0,2). Mark the first one (0,1) as visited.
8. The unvisited neighbors of node (0,1) are (0,0) and (1,1). Update their distances:
   - (1,1): distance = min(2, 1 + 2) = 2
9. Find the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes, which is node (2,0) and (0,2). Mark the first one (2,0) as visited.
10. The unvisited neighbors of node (2,0) are (2,1) and (3,0). Update their distances:
    - (2,1): distance = 3
    - (3,0): distance = 3
11. Continue this process until the target node (3,3) is visited.

Once the target node (3,3) is visited, we can backtrace the path from the target node to the source node by following the predecessor pointers.

The path from the source node (0,0) to the target node (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is represented in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, where the first coordinate is the row and the second coordinate is the column.
