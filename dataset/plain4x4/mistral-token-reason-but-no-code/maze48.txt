To solve the maze, we will use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is an efficient graph traversal method. BFS guarantees to find the shortest path between the origin and the target if such a path exists.

Before applying BFS, let's understand the given adjacency list representation of the maze:

<ADJLIST_START>
(2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (1,1) <--> (2,1) ; (2,2) <--> (2,1) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (0,1) <--> (0,2) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1)
<ADJLIST_END>
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Now, let's implement the BFS algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty queue and enqueue the origin node (0,0).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the current node from the queue.
   b. If the current node is the target node (3,3), we have found the path, and we can stop.
   c. Otherwise, mark the current node as visited.
   d. For each neighbor node that is not yet visited:
       i. Enqueue the neighbor node to the queue.
       ii. Set the current node as the predecessor of the neighbor node.
3. Reconstruct the path by following the predecessors from the target node back to the origin node.

Applying BFS to the given maze, we obtain the following path:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END>

The path in the format of a coordinate list is enclosed between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. The first coordinate represents the row, and the second coordinate represents the column. The path starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,3).

Note: If there is no path from the origin to the target, the BFS algorithm will still terminate, but the queue will be empty, and no path will be found.
