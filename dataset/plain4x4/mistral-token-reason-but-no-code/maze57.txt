To solve the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can easily traverse the graph and find a path from the origin to the target.

Let's use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the origin node.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.
   b. If the node is the target, return the path.
   c. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.
3. If the target is not found, return "No path found."

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Origin node: (0, 0)
2. Queue: [(0, 0)]
3. Dequeue (0, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 0), (0, 3)
4. Queue: [(1, 0), (0, 3)]
5. Dequeue (1, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 0), (1, 1)
6. Queue: [(0, 3), (2, 0), (1, 1)]
7. Dequeue (0, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 3)
8. Queue: [(2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3)]
9. Dequeue (2, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 1)
10. Queue: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1)]
11. Dequeue (1, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 1)
12. Queue: [(1, 3), (2, 1), (0, 1)]
13. Dequeue (1, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3)
14. Queue: [(2, 1), (0, 1), (2, 3)]
15. Dequeue (2, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 1)
16. Queue: [(0, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)]
17. Dequeue (0, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 1) (already visited)
18. Queue: [(2, 3), (3, 1)]
19. Dequeue (2, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 3) (target found)
20. Return the path: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3)

The shortest path from the origin to the target is:
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
