To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can easily traverse the graph and find a path from the origin to the target.

Let's use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target:

1. Initialize a queue with the origin node (0, 0).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the current node from the queue.
   b. If the current node is the target node (3, 3), we have found the solution. Break the loop and return the path.
   c. Otherwise, add all unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node to the queue.
   d. Mark the current node as visited.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize the queue with the origin node (0, 0): [(0, 0)]
2. Dequeue the current node (0, 0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(1, 0), (0, 1)]
3. Dequeue the next node (1, 0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 0), (1, 1)]
4. Dequeue the next node (0, 1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(1, 1), (0, 2)]
5. Dequeue the next node (2, 0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(1, 0), (3, 0)]
6. Dequeue the next node (1, 1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 1), (0, 1)]
7. Dequeue the next node (0, 2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(1, 2)]
8. Dequeue the next node (3, 0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 0)]
9. Dequeue the next node (2, 1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(3, 1), (1, 1)]
10. Dequeue the next node (1, 2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 2), (0, 2)]
11. Dequeue the next node (3, 1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 1)]
12. Dequeue the next node (2, 2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(3, 2), (1, 2)]
13. Dequeue the next node (0, 3) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(1, 3)]
14. Dequeue the next node (1, 3) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 3), (0, 3)]
15. Dequeue the next node (3, 2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 2)]
16. Dequeue the next node (2, 3) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(3, 3), (1, 3)]
17. Dequeue the next node (3, 3) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: [(2, 3)]

The target node (3, 3) is found in the queue, so we have found the solution. The path from the origin to the target is:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
