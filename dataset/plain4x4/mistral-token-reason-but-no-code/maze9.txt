To find a solution for the given maze, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to the vertices at the next depth level. This algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a maze, as it guarantees that the first path it finds from the origin to the target is the shortest possible.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we can use BFS to solve the maze:

1. Create a queue to keep track of the vertices to visit.
2. Create a set to store the visited vertices.
3. Enqueue the origin vertex into the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue the front vertex from the queue.
	* If the dequeued vertex is the target, retrace the path from the target to the origin and return the solution.
	* Otherwise, mark the dequeued vertex as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors into the queue.
5. If the target is not found after exploring all vertices, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Create a queue and a set: queue = [(0,0)], visited = {(0,0)}
2. Dequeue the front vertex: (0,0)
3. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(1,0), (0,1)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)}
4. Dequeue the front vertex: (1,0)
5. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(1,1), (2,0)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0)}
6. Dequeue the front vertex: (1,1)
7. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(1,2), (2,1)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1)}
8. Dequeue the front vertex: (1,2)
9. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(1,3), (2,2)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2)}
10. Dequeue the front vertex: (1,3)
11. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(0,3)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,3)}
12. Dequeue the front vertex: (0,3)
13. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(0,2)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,3), (0,2)}
14. Dequeue the front vertex: (0,2)
15. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(0,1)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)}
16. Dequeue the front vertex: (0,1)
17. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: queue = [(0,0)], visited = {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0)}
18. Dequeue the front vertex: (0,0)
19. There are no unvisited neighbors
