To solve the maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can easily implement either of these algorithms.

Let's use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. BFS explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first path found to the target will be the shortest one.

Here's the reasoning behind using BFS:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the origin node.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.
   b. If the dequeued node is the target, we have found the shortest path. Break the loop.
   c. Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the dequeued node that have not been visited yet.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize the queue with the origin node: (0,0)
2. Dequeue the origin node: (0,0)
3. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (0,1), (1,0)
4. Dequeue the next node: (0,1)
5. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (0,2)
6. Dequeue the next node: (1,0)
7. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (2,0), (1,1)
8. Dequeue the next node: (0,2)
9. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (0,3)
10. Dequeue the next node: (2,0)
11. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (3,0), (2,1)
12. Dequeue the next node: (1,1)
13. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (1,2)
14. Dequeue the next node: (3,0)
15. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: None (no neighbors)
16. Dequeue the next node: (2,1)
17. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (3,1), (2,2)
18. Dequeue the next node: (0,3)
19. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: None (no neighbors)
20. Dequeue the next node: (1,2)
21. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (2,2)
22. Dequeue the next node: (3,1)
23. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (3,2)
24. Dequeue the next node: (2,2)
25. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: None (no neighbors)
26. Dequeue the next node: (3,2)
27. Enqueue its neighboring nodes: (3,3)
28. Dequeue the next node: (3,3)
29. We have found the target node. The shortest path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
