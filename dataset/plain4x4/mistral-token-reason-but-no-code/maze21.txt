To solve the maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can easily implement either of these algorithms.

Let's use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. BFS explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that we find the shortest path to the target.

Here's the reasoning behind using BFS:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the origin node.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.
   b. If the node is the target, we have found the shortest path. Break the loop.
   c. Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet.
   d. Mark the current node as visited.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.
4. If the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the origin node to find the shortest path.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the origin node (0, 0).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue: (0, 0).
   b. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (0, 1), (1, 0).
   c. Mark the current node as visited.
   d. Dequeue a node from the queue: (0, 1).
   e. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (0, 2).
   f. Mark the current node as visited.
   g. Dequeue a node from the queue: (1, 0).
   h. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (1, 1), (2, 0).
   i. Mark the current node as visited.
   j. Dequeue a node from the queue: (0, 2).
   k. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (0, 3), (1, 2).
   l. Mark the current node as visited.
   m. Dequeue a node from the queue: (1, 1).
   n. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (1, 2), (2, 1).
   o. Mark the current node as visited.
   p. Dequeue a node from the queue: (2, 0).
   q. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (2, 1).
   r. Mark the current node as visited.
   s. Dequeue a node from the queue: (0, 3).
   t. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (0, 2).
   u. Mark the current node as visited.
   v. Dequeue a node from the queue: (1, 2).
   w. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (1, 3), (2, 2).
   x. Mark the current node as visited.
   y. Dequeue a node from the queue: (2, 1).
   z. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (2, 2), (3, 1).
   aa. Mark the current node as visited.
   bb. Dequeue a node from the queue: (2, 2).
   cc. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (2, 3), (3, 2).
   dd. Mark the current node as visited.
   ee. Dequeue a node from the queue: (3, 1).
   ff. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (3, 2).
   gg. Mark the current node as visited.
   hh. Dequeue a node from the queue: (2, 3).
   ii. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (3, 3).
   jj. Mark the current node as visited.
   kk. Dequeue a node from the queue: (3, 2).
   ll. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet: (3, 3).
   mm. Mark the current node as visited.
   nn. Dequeue a node from the queue: (3, 3).
   oo. The target node is found. Break the loop.
3. Backtrack from the target node (3, 3) to the origin node (0, 0) to find the shortest path:
   a. (3, 3) -> (2, 3)
   b. (2, 3) -> (2, 2)
   c. (2, 2) -> (2, 1)
   d. (2, 1) -> (1, 1)
   e. (1, 1) -> (1, 0)
   f. (1, 0) -> (0, 0)

The shortest path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3) is:
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
