The given maze is represented as a graph using an adjacency list. The goal is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), while navigating through the available connections between coordinates.

The reasoning behind choosing a pathfinding strategy can be based on the following points:

1. The graph representation of the maze allows us to use graph traversal algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

2. DFS is a recursive approach and can lead to exponential time complexity in certain cases, whereas BFS has a linear time complexity and is more suitable for finding the shortest path in a graph.

3. In this case, we will use BFS to find the solution, as it is more efficient and guarantees a shortest path, if one exists.

Here are the steps to implement BFS for this maze:

1. Initialize a queue, a set to keep track of visited coordinates, and a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path.

2. Enqueue the origin point and mark it as visited.

3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the current coordinate.
   b. Check if the current coordinate is the target point. If it is, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary and stop.
   c. Otherwise, check all neighboring coordinates of the current coordinate, and enqueue and mark them as visited if they are not visited before.

Applying the BFS algorithm to the given maze with the origin point (0,0) and target point (3,3), we obtain the following path:

<PATH_START>
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(0,3)
(1,3)
(2,3)
(3,3)
<PATH_END>
