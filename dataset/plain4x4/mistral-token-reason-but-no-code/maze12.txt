To solve a maze represented as a graph in adjacency list format, we will follow a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an efficient way to find the shortest path in a graph with unweighted edges, which is our case with the given maze.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the BFS algorithm:

1. Create a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Add the origin point to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the front node from the queue.
   b. Check if the dequeued node is the target point. If so, we have found the solution, and we can stop.
   c. Otherwise, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.
   d. Repeat step 3.

Now let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Parse the adjacency list to create the graph.
2. Initialize the queue with the origin point: (0,0).
3. Initialize the set of visited nodes with (0,0).
4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the front node from the queue: (0,0).
   b. Check if the dequeued node is the target point: (3,3). It is not, so continue.
   c. Add its unvisited neighbors to the queue: (1,0), (0,1).
   d. Mark the neighbors as visited: (1,0), (0,1).
   e. Repeat step 4.

Following the BFS algorithm, we get the following path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path represents the shortest route through the maze.
