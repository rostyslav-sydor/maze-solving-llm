To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since BFS is more efficient in finding the shortest path in a maze, we will implement the BFS algorithm.

The BFS algorithm works by starting at the origin node and exploring all the neighboring nodes first before moving to the next level of nodes. We will maintain a queue (FIFO) to store the nodes to be explored and a visited set to keep track of the nodes already visited. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Create an empty queue and a visited set.
2. Enqueue the origin node and add it to the visited set.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue and check if it's the target node. If it is, we found a solution and can stop the search.
   b. Otherwise, add all the unvisited neighboring nodes to the queue and the visited set.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the given maze:

1. Origin node: (0,0)
2. Queue: [(0,0)]
3. Visited: [(0,0)]
4. Dequeue (0,0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(1,0), (0,1)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)]
5. Dequeue (1,0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(0,1), (2,0)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0)]
6. Dequeue (0,1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(2,0), (1,1), (0,2)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2)]
7. Dequeue (2,0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(1,1), (0,2), (3,0)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (3,0)]
8. Dequeue (1,1) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(0,2), (3,0), (1,2)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (3,0), (1,2)]
9. Dequeue (0,2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
   Queue: [(3,0), (1,2), (0,3)]
   Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (3,0), (1,2), (0,3)]
10. Dequeue (3,0) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
    Queue: [(1,2), (0,3), (2,0)]
    Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (3,0), (1,2), (0,3), (2,0)]
11. Dequeue (1,2) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
    Queue: [(0,3), (2,0), (1,3)]
    Visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (3,0), (1,2), (0,3), (2,0), (1,3)]
12. Dequeue (0,3) and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and visited set:
    Queue: [(2,0), (1,
