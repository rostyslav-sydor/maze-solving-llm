To find a solution for the given maze, we can use the A* (A-Star) algorithm, which is a pathfinding algorithm that combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. A* uses a heuristic function to guide the search and find the optimal path from the origin to the target.

In this case, the heuristic function we will use is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the row and column coordinates of two points.

Here's the reasoning behind using A*:

1. Initialize the algorithm with the origin node (0,0), set its cost (g-cost) to 0, set its estimated cost to the target (h-cost) using the Manhattan distance, and add it to the priority queue.
2. While the priority queue is not empty:
   a. Remove the node with the lowest cost (f-cost = g-cost + h-cost) from the priority queue.
   b. Check if the node is the target node. If it is, construct the path by tracing back the parent pointers and return the solution.
   c. Expand the node and generate its successors (neighboring nodes).
   d. For each successor:
       i. Calculate its g-cost by adding the cost of the current node to the cost of moving to the successor.
       ii. If the successor is not in the priority queue or its g-cost is lower than the previous one, update its g-cost, set its parent pointer to the current node, and add it to the priority queue.

Now let's apply the A* algorithm to the given maze:

1. Initialize the algorithm with origin node (0,0):
   - g-cost = 0
   - h-cost = Manhattan distance from (0,0) to (3,3) = |0 - 3| + |0 - 3| = 6
   - f-cost = g-cost + h-cost = 0 + 6 = 6
   - Add (0,0) to the priority queue

2. While the priority queue is not empty:
   a. Remove the node with the lowest f-cost, which is initially (0,0).
   b. Check if the node is the target node. It's not, so continue.
   c. Expand node (0,0) and generate its successors: (0,1) and (1,0)
   d. For each successor:
       i. Calculate its g-cost:
          - (0,1): g-cost = 0 + 1 = 1
          - (1,0): g-cost = 0 + 1 = 1
       ii. If the successor is not in the priority queue or its g-cost is lower than the previous one, update its g-cost, set its parent pointer to the current node, and add it to the priority queue:
          - (0,1): Add to the priority queue with g-cost = 1, h-cost = 5, and f-cost = 6
          - (1,0): Add to the priority queue with g-cost = 1, h-cost = 5, and f-cost = 6

3. Continue iterating until the target node (3,3) is reached.

The resulting path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is the output in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
