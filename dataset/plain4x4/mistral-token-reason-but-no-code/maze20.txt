To solve the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). In this case, we'll use BFS since it is more suitable for finding the shortest path.

1. First, we need to convert the adjacency list representation into a graph. We can do this by creating a 2D array to represent the maze, where each cell corresponds to a node in the graph.
2. Initialize a queue with the starting point (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue the current node from the queue.
	* Check if the current node is the target (3, 3). If it is, we have found the solution, and we can stop the search.
	* Otherwise, for each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
		+ Enqueue the neighbor in the queue.
		+ Mark the neighbor as visited.
		+ Set the parent of the neighbor to be the current node.
4. Once we find the target node, we can trace back the path from the target to the origin by following the parent pointers.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the given maze:

1. Convert the adjacency list to a graph:
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
2. Initialize the queue with the starting point (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue the current node (0, 0).
	* Check if the current node is the target (3, 3). It is not, so continue.
	* Enqueue and mark as visited the unvisited neighbors of the current node: (1, 0), (0, 1).
	* Set the parent of (1, 0) and (0, 1) to be (0, 0).
	* Repeat the process for the next node in the queue, which is now (1, 0).
	* Continue until the target node (3, 3) is found.
4. Trace back the path from the target to the origin:
```
(3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0)
```
5. Reverse the path to get the solution:
```
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (2, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
```
This is the shortest path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3) in the given maze.
