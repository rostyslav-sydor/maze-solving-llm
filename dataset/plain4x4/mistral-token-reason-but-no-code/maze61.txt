The adjacency list provided represents a maze, where each coordinate pair (x, y) represents a position in the maze. The connections between these positions are represented by the arrows (<-->) and semicolons (;). The origin and target points are marked by the <ORIGIN_START> and <TARGET_START> tokens, respectively.

To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. In this case, we will use the BFS algorithm, as it is more suitable for finding the shortest path in a maze.

Here's how the BFS algorithm works:

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Add all adjacent unvisited nodes to a queue.
3. Dequeue the first node from the queue and mark it as visited.
4. If the dequeued node is the target point (3, 3), we have found the solution and can stop the algorithm.
5. Otherwise, add all adjacent unvisited nodes to the queue and go back to step 3.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the provided maze:

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (1, 0).
2. Dequeue (1, 0) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (0, 1) and (2, 0).
3. Dequeue (0, 1) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (2, 0) and (0, 2).
4. Dequeue (2, 0) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (0, 2), (3, 0), and (2, 1).
5. Dequeue (0, 2) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (3, 0), (2, 1), and (1, 2).
6. Dequeue (3, 0) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (2, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 1).
7. Dequeue (2, 1) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (1, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 2).
8. Dequeue (1, 2) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (3, 1), (2, 2), and (1, 1).
9. Dequeue (3, 1) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (2, 2), (1, 1), and (3, 2).
10. Dequeue (2, 2) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (1, 1), (3, 2), and (2, 3).
11. Dequeue (1, 1) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (3, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 0).
12. Dequeue (3, 2) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (2, 3), (1, 0), and (3, 3).
13. Dequeue (2, 3) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (1, 0), (3, 3), and (1, 3).
14. Dequeue (1, 0) and mark it as visited. The queue now contains (3, 3) and (1, 3).
15. Dequeue (3, 3), which is the target point.

The solution to the maze is the path from the origin point (0, 0) to the target point (3, 3). We can trace this path by following the sequence of dequeued nodes:

(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 0) -> (3, 3)

Therefore, the solution in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END
