To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Here's the reasoning behind using DFS for maze solving:

1. DFS is well-suited for exploring all possible paths in a maze, as it recursively visits all reachable vertices in the graph.
2. The algorithm keeps track of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops and cycles.
3. The maze can be represented as a graph, where each node represents a position in the maze, and edges represent the possible paths between those positions.

Here's a step-by-step description of the DFS algorithm for maze solving:

1. Start at the origin node (`(0,0)` in this case).
2. Mark the origin node as visited and add it to the path list.
3. Find all unvisited neighbors of the current node.
4. If any of the unvisited neighbors is the target node (`(3,3)` in this case), add it to the path list and return the path.
5. If there are no unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the previous node in the path and remove the current node from the path list.
6. If there's a previous node to backtrack to, go to step 3; otherwise, there's no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply the DFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start at `(0,0)` and add it to the path list.
2. Find unvisited neighbors of `(0,0)`: `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
3. Visit `(0,1)` and add it to the path list.
4. Find unvisited neighbors of `(0,1)`: `(0,2)` and `(1,1)`.
5. Visit `(0,2)` and add it to the path list.
6. Find unvisited neighbors of `(0,2)`: `(0,3)`.
7. Visit `(0,3)` and add it to the path list.
8. There are no unvisited neighbors of `(0,3)`, so backtrack to `(0,2)`.
9. There are no unvisited neighbors of `(0,2)`, so backtrack to `(0,1)`.
10. Visit `(1,1)` and add it to the path list.
11. Find unvisited neighbors of `(1,1)`: `(1,2)` and `(2,1)`.
12. Visit `(1,2)` and add it to the path list.
13. Find unvisited neighbors of `(1,2)`: `(2,2)`.
14. Visit `(2,2)` and add it to the path list.
15. There are no unvisited neighbors of `(2,2)`, so backtrack to `(1,2)`.
16. There are no unvisited neighbors of `(1,2)`, so backtrack to `(1,1)`.
17. Visit `(2,1)` and add it to the path list.
18. Find unvisited neighbors of `(2,1)`: `(3,1)`.
19. Visit `(3,1)` and add it to the path list.
20. Find unvisited neighbors of `(3,1)`: `(3,2)`.
21. Visit `(3,2)` and add it to the path list.
22. Find unvisited neighbors of `(3,2)`: `(3,3)`.
23. Visit `(3,3)`, which is the target node. Add it to the path list and return the path.

The solved path is: `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,1) (1,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`
