To find a solution for the given maze, we will use the A* search algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search toward the target node. In this case, our heuristic will be the Manhattan distance between the current node and the target node.

Here's the reasoning for using A*:

1. It's a best-first search algorithm, meaning it tries to find the optimal solution by expanding the most promising node first.
2. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from the current node. In our case, the Manhattan distance is a good heuristic because it provides a lower bound on the actual cost of reaching the target node.
3. A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost) and consistent (monotonic). The Manhattan distance is both admissible and consistent.

Now let's implement the A* search algorithm for the given maze:

1. Start with the origin node (0,0) and add it to the open list.
2. While the open list is not empty:
   a. Select the node with the lowest f-score (f = g + h, where g is the cost of reaching the node from the origin, and h is the estimated cost of reaching the target from the node) and remove it from the open list.
   b. If the selected node is the target node (3,3), then construct the path by backtracking from the target node to the origin node and output the solution between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
   c. Otherwise, expand the selected node by adding its unvisited neighbors to the open list and update their g, h, and f scores.

Now, let's apply the A* search algorithm to the given maze:

1. Start with the origin node (0,0). Its g-score is 0, and its h-score (Manhattan distance to the target) is 6. So, its f-score is 6.
2. Select the node with the lowest f-score, which is (0,0). Remove it from the open list. Its neighbors are (0,1) and (1,0).
3. Expand the selected node (0,0) by adding its unvisited neighbors (0,1) and (1,0) to the open list. Update their g, h, and f scores:
   - (0,1): g = 1, h = 5, f = 6
   - (1,0): g = 1, h = 5, f = 6
4. Select the node with the lowest f-score, which is (0,1). Remove it from the open list. Its neighbors are (0,2) and (1,1).
5. Expand the selected node (0,1) by adding its unvisited neighbors (0,2) and (1,1) to the open list. Update their g, h, and f scores:
   - (0,2): g = 2, h = 4, f = 6
   - (1,1): g = 2, h = 4, f = 6
6. Select the node with the lowest f-score, which is (1,0). Remove it from the open list. Its neighbors are (1,1) and (2,0).
7. Expand the selected node (1,0) by adding its unvisited neighbors (1,1) and (2,0) to the open list. Update their g, h, and f scores:
   - (1,1): g = 2 (already visited), h = 4, f = 6
   - (2,0): g = 2, h = 5, f = 7
8. Select the node with the lowest f-score, which is (0,2). Remove it from the open list. Its neighbors are (0,3) and (1,2).
9. Expand the selected node (0,2) by adding its unvisited neighbors (0,3) and (1,2) to the open list. Update their g, h, and f scores:
   - (0,3): g = 3, h = 3, f = 6
   - (1,2): g = 3, h = 3, f = 6
10. Select the node with the lowest f-score, which is (1,1). Remove it from the open list. Its neighbors are (0,1) (al
