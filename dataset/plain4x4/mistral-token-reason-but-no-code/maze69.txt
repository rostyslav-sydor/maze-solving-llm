To solve the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can easily traverse the graph and find a path from the origin to the target.

Let's use BFS to find the shortest path:

1. Initialize a queue with the origin node (0,0).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the current node from the queue.
   b. If the current node is the target node (3,3), we have found the path. Break the loop.
   c. Otherwise, add all unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node to the queue.
   d. Mark the current node as visited.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.
4. If the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the origin node to find the path.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize the queue with the origin node (0,0).
2. Dequeue the current node (0,0) from the queue.
3. Add its unvisited neighboring nodes (0,1) and (1,0) to the queue.
4. Mark (0,0) as visited.
5. Dequeue the current node (0,1) from the queue.
6. Add its unvisited neighboring node (0,2) to the queue.
7. Mark (0,1) as visited.
8. Dequeue the current node (1,0) from the queue.
9. Add its unvisited neighboring node (2,0) to the queue.
10. Mark (1,0) as visited.
11. Dequeue the current node (0,2) from the queue.
12. Add its unvisited neighboring nodes (0,3) and (1,2) to the queue.
13. Mark (0,2) as visited.
14. Dequeue the current node (2,0) from the queue.
15. Add its unvisited neighboring nodes (2,1) and (3,0) to the queue.
16. Mark (2,0) as visited.
17. Dequeue the current node (0,3) from the queue.
18. Add its unvisited neighboring node (1,3) to the queue.
19. Mark (0,3) as visited.
20. Dequeue the current node (1,2) from the queue.
21. Add its unvisited neighboring node (1,1) to the queue.
22. Mark (1,2) as visited.
23. Dequeue the current node (2,1) from the queue.
24. Add its unvisited neighboring node (2,2) to the queue.
25. Mark (2,1) as visited.
26. Dequeue the current node (3,0) from the queue.
27. Add its unvisited neighboring node (3,1) to the queue.
28. Mark (3,0) as visited.
29. Dequeue the current node (1,3) from the queue.
30. Mark (1,3) as visited.
31. Dequeue the current node (1,1) from the queue.
32. Add its unvisited neighboring node (2,1) to the queue.
33. Mark (1,1) as visited.
34. Dequeue the current node (2,2) from the queue.
35. Mark (2,2) as visited.
36. Dequeue the current node (3,1) from the queue.
37. Add its unvisited neighboring node (3,2) to the queue.
38. Mark (3,1) as visited.
39. Dequeue the current node (3,2) from the queue.
40. Add its unvisited neighboring node (3,3) to the queue.
41. Mark (3,2) as visited.
42. Dequeue the current node (3,3) from the queue.
43. We have found the target node (3,3). Break the loop.

Now, let's backtrack from the target node (3,3) to the origin node (0,0) to find the path:

1. (3,3) was reached from (3,2).
2. (3,2) was reached from (3,1).
3. (3,1) was reached from (3,0).
4. (3,0) was reached from (2,0).
5. (2,0) was reached from (1,0).
6. (1,0) was reached from (0,0).

So, the path from the origin to the target is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
