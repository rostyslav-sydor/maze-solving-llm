The maze is represented as a graph, where each token is a vertex and the edges are defined by the adjacency list. We can solve this maze using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms. Both algorithms can be applied to find a path from the origin to the target.

In this case, let's use the DFS algorithm to find a solution for the given maze. The DFS algorithm starts at the origin vertex and recursively explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here's the reasoning behind the DFS algorithm:

1. Start at the origin vertex (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Choose an unvisited vertex adjacent to the current vertex. If there is no unvisited vertex, backtrack to the previous vertex.
3. Repeat step 2 until the target vertex (3,3) is reached or there are no more unvisited vertices.

Applying the DFS algorithm to the given maze, we get the following solution:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
<PATH_END>

So, the specific solution for this maze in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
