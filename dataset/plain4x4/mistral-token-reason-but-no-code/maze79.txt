To solve this maze, we'll use the A* (A-star) algorithm, which is an efficient pathfinding algorithm that combines the strengths of both Dijkstra's algorithm and the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm. The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide its search towards the goal and finds the shortest path while minimizing the number of nodes it needs to explore.

Here's how we'll apply the A* algorithm to this maze:

1. Create a priority queue to store the nodes that need to be explored. The priority queue will be sorted based on the sum of the actual cost (G) and the estimated cost (H) to reach the target node. This sum is called the F-score.
2. Initialize the priority queue with the origin node (0,0), set its G-score to 0, and calculate its H-score as the Manhattan distance to the target node (3,3).
3. While the priority queue is not empty:
	* Pop the node with the lowest F-score from the priority queue and add it to the path (if the node is not already in the path).
	* If the node is the target node (3,3), we have found the shortest path. Trace the path back from the target node to the origin node using the parent pointers and output the path.
	* Otherwise, expand the current node by considering its adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node:
		+ If the node is not in the path and is not a wall, calculate its G-score (the actual cost to reach the node from the origin) and H-score (the estimated cost to reach the target node). Add the node to the priority queue with its F-score (G + H).
		+ Update the parent pointer of the node to point to the current node.

Now, let's apply the A* algorithm to the given maze:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
</PATH_END>

The output path is given between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, representing the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the maze.
