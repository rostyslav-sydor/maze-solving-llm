The given maze is represented as an adjacency list with entry and exit points marked with the <ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END> tokens, respectively. To find a solution for this maze, we can use a depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph and find a path from the origin to the target.

Here's an example of how we can apply a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to solve the maze:

1. Initialize an empty stack and push the origin node onto the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty:
   a. Pop the top node from the stack.
   b. If the node is the target node, mark the node as visited and return the path.
   c. Otherwise, mark the node as visited and push all its unvisited neighbors onto the stack.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Applying this algorithm to the given maze, we can find a path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3) as follows:

1. Push (0, 0) onto the stack.
2. Pop (0, 0), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbors (0, 1) and (1, 0) onto the stack.
3. Pop (0, 1), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbor (0, 2) onto the stack.
4. Pop (0, 2), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbor (0, 3) onto the stack.
5. Pop (0, 3), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbor (1, 3) onto the stack.
6. Pop (1, 3), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbor (2, 3) onto the stack.
7. Pop (2, 3), mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbor (3, 3) onto the stack.
8. Pop (3, 3), mark it as visited, and return the path from the origin to the target.

The path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3) is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
