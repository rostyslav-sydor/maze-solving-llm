To solve the maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS systematically explores all possible paths from the origin to the target, ensuring we find the shortest path. Here's a step-by-step explanation for the provided maze:

1. Identify the origin and target coordinates:
   Origin: (0, 0)
   Target: (3, 3)

2. Create a graph representation of the maze:
   The adjacency list given represents the graph, with each token separated by ';'. Each token represents an edge between two points in the maze. For example, (3,2) <--> (3,1) means there is a connection between point (3,2) and (3,1).

3. Initialize the search:
   A. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.
   B. Enqueue the origin node (0, 0) into the queue.
   C. Mark the origin node as visited.

4. Begin the Breadth-First Search:
   A. While the queue is not empty:
      i. Dequeue a node from the queue, and set it as the current node.
      ii. Check if the current node is the target node. If it is, we have found the solution, and we can exit the loop.
      iii. If the current node is not the target node, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.

5. Reconstruct the path:
   A. If the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the origin node to find the path, adding each node to a path list.

6. Output the path:
   Enclose the path between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with each coordinate separated by a space.

   For the given maze, the specific solution is:
   <PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (1, 1) (1, 2) (2, 2) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

   This path starts at (0, 0), moves up to (0, 1), then right to (1, 1), down to (1, 2), right to (2, 2), up to (2, 3), and finally right to the target (3, 3).
