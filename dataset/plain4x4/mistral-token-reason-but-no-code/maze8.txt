To find a solution for this maze, we first need to understand the key components of a graph that represent a maze and its adjacency list. A graph is a collection of nodes or vertices connected by edges. In a maze, these nodes are represented by coordinates, and the edges represent the paths between those coordinates.

The adjacency list provided in this problem is a representation of the edges in the graph. Each line in the list represents a connection between two nodes. For example, (3,0) <--> (3,1) means that there is an edge connecting the node (3,0) to the node (3,1).

Now that we understand the structure of the graph, we can apply a search algorithm to find a path from the origin to the target. In this case, the origin is (0,0), and the target is (3,3).

There are two popular search algorithms for finding paths in graphs: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Since BFS is more efficient for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this maze, we will use BFS to find the solution.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:

1. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.
2. Enqueue the origin node (0,0) into the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the front node from the queue.
   b. If the dequeued node is the target node (3,3), return the path.
   c. Otherwise, visit all the neighboring nodes of the dequeued node. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, enqueue it into the queue and mark it as visited.

Now, let's apply BFS to this specific maze:

1. Enqueue (0,0) into the queue.
2. Dequeue (0,0) and enqueue its neighbors (0,1), (1,0) into the queue.
3. Dequeue (0,1) and enqueue its neighbors (0,2) into the queue.
4. Dequeue (1,0) and enqueue its neighbors (2,0) into the queue.
5. Dequeue (0,2) and enqueue its neighbors (0,3) into the queue.
6. Dequeue (2,0) and enqueue its neighbors (3,0) into the queue.
7. Dequeue (0,3) and enqueue its neighbors (1,3) into the queue.
8. Dequeue (3,0) and enqueue its neighbors (3,1) into the queue.
9. Dequeue (1,3) and enqueue its neighbors (2,3) into the queue.
10. Dequeue (3,1) and enqueue its neighbors (3,2) into the queue.
11. Dequeue (2,3) and enqueue its neighbors (3,3) into the queue.
12. The target (3,3) has been found, so we can stop and trace back the path from the target to the origin:
    
    <PATH_START> (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (1,0) (0,0) <PATH_END>

The path is the reverse of the order in which the nodes were enqueued. The solution path, in the required format, is:

<PATH_START> (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (1,0) (0,0) <PATH_END>

This path represents the shortest possible route from the origin to the target in the given maze.
