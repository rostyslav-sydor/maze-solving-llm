To solve a maze represented as an adjacency list, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the origin point and systematically explores all the neighboring vertices (or coordinate pairs) until it finds the target point. Here's how we can apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Create a queue to hold the vertices to be explored.
2. Add the origin point to the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Remove the first vertex (coordinate pair) from the queue.
   b. If the vertex is the target point, then we have found the solution, and we can output the path.
   c. Otherwise, add all the neighboring vertices (coordinate pairs) of the current vertex to the queue, and mark them as visited.
4. If we have not found the target point, then there is no solution.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the given maze:

1. The origin point is (0, 0), so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
2. The neighbors of (0, 0) are (0, 1) and (1, 0), so we add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
3. The next vertex in the queue is (0, 1), but it has no unvisited neighbors, so we remove it from the queue.
4. The next vertex in the queue is (1, 0). Its neighbors are (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 0), but (0, 0) and (1, 0) have already been visited, so we only add (1, 1) and (2, 0) to the queue and mark them as visited.
5. The next vertex in the queue is (1, 1). Its neighbors are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), but (1, 0) and (1, 1) have already been visited, so we only add (1, 2) and (2, 1) to the queue and mark them as visited.
6. The next vertex in the queue is (2, 0). Its neighbors are (1, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0), but (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1) have already been visited, so we only add (3, 0) to the queue and mark it as visited.
7. The next vertex in the queue is (1, 2). Its neighbors are (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 2), but (1, 1) and (1, 2) have already been visited, so we only add (1, 3) and (2, 2) to the queue and mark them as visited.
8. The next vertex in the queue is (3, 0). Its neighbors are (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 0), but (2, 0), (3, 0), and (3, 1) have already been visited, so we only add (4, 0) to the queue and mark it as visited.
9. The next vertex in the queue is (2, 1). Its neighbors are (1, 1), (2, 0), and (3, 1), but (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1) have already been visited, so we don't add any vertices to the queue.
10. The next vertex in the queue is (1, 3). Its neighbors are (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 3), but (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) have already been visited, so we only add (2, 3) to the queue and mark it as visited.
11. The next vertex in the queue is (4, 0). Its neighbors are (3, 0), (4, 1), and (5, 0), but (3, 0), (4, 0), and (4, 1) have already been visited, so we only add (5, 0) to the queue and mark it as visited.
12. The next vertex in the queue is (2, 2). Its neighbors are (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 2), but (
