To solve the given maze, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm explores all the possible paths in the maze by adding the neighboring cells to a queue, and then traverses the queue to find the shortest path. We will start from the origin (0,0) and search for the target (3,3).

1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Add the origin node to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.
   b. If the dequeued node is the target, return the path.
   c. For each neighbor of the dequeued node:
       i. If the neighbor is not visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
       ii. Update the parent of the neighbor to be the dequeued node.
4. If the queue is empty and the target is not found, there is no path from origin to target.
5. Trace the path from the target to the origin by following the parent pointers.

Now, let's apply the algorithm to our specific maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution path is (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), as represented by the tokens between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.
