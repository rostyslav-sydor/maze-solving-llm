To solve the maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we can use BFS to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here's the reasoning behind using BFS:

1. BFS explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level. This ensures that we find the shortest path to the target.
2. BFS uses a queue data structure to store the nodes to be visited. This allows us to process the nodes in the order they are discovered, which is crucial for finding the shortest path.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze:

1. Initialize an empty queue and add the origin node (0,0) to it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the first node from the queue and mark it as visited.
   b. If the dequeued node is the target node (3,3), we have found the solution. Break the loop and output the path.
   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of the dequeued node.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply BFS to the given maze and find the shortest path:

1. Initialize an empty queue and add the origin node (0,0) to it.
2. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0,0). Mark it as visited.
3. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (0,0): (1,0), (0,1).
4. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1,0). Mark it as visited.
5. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (1,0): (2,0).
6. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0,1). Mark it as visited.
7. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (0,1): (0,2).
8. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2,0). Mark it as visited.
9. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (2,0): (3,0).
10. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0,2). Mark it as visited.
11. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (0,2): (1,2).
12. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1,2). Mark it as visited.
13. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (1,2): (0,2), (1,3).
14. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3,0). Mark it as visited.
15. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (3,0): (3,1).
16. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1,3). Mark it as visited.
17. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (1,3): (2,3).
18. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2,3). Mark it as visited.
19. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (2,3): (2,2).
20. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3,1). Mark it as visited.
21. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (3,1): (3,2).
22. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2,2). Mark it as visited.
23. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (2,2): (2,1).
24. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3,2). Mark it as visited.
25. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (3,2): (3,3).
26. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2,1). Mark it as visited.
27. Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of (2,1): (1,1).
28. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3,3). Mark it as visited.
29. The target node (3,3) is found. Break the loop and output the path.

The shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
