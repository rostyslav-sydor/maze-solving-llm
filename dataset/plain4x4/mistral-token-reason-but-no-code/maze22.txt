To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). In this case, we will use BFS, as it is more suitable for finding the shortest path in a maze.

BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the algorithm finds the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works for this maze:

1. Initialize a queue with the origin node (0, 0).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the first node from the queue.
   b. If the dequeued node is the target node (3, 3), we have found the solution. Break the loop and return the path.
   c. Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the dequeued node that have not been visited yet. Mark these nodes as visited.
3. If the target node is not found, there is no path from the origin to the target.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. Initialize the queue with the origin node (0, 0).
2. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0, 0).
3. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (0, 0) that have not been visited yet: (0, 1), (1, 0).
4. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0, 1).
5. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (0, 1) that have not been visited yet: (0, 2).
6. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1, 0).
7. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (1, 0) that have not been visited yet: (1, 1), (2, 0).
8. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (0, 2).
9. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (0, 2) that have not been visited yet: (1, 2).
10. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1, 1).
11. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (1, 1) that have not been visited yet: (1, 2).
12. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2, 0).
13. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (2, 0) that have not been visited yet: (2, 1), (3, 0).
14. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1, 2).
15. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (1, 2) that have not been visited yet: (1, 3).
16. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2, 1).
17. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (2, 1) that have not been visited yet: (2, 2).
18. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3, 0).
19. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (3, 0) that have not been visited yet: (3, 1).
20. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (1, 3).
21. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (1, 3) that have not been visited yet: (2, 3).
22. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2, 2).
23. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (2, 2) that have not been visited yet: (2, 3), (3, 2).
24. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (2, 3).
25. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (2, 3) that have not been visited yet: (3, 3).
26. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3, 1).
27. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (3, 1) that have not been visited yet: (3, 2).
28. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3, 2).
29. Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of (3, 2) that have not been visited yet: (3, 3).
30. Dequeue the first node from the queue: (3, 3).

We have found the target node (3, 3). Now, we can backtrack from the target node to the origin node to find the path:

(3, 3) <-- (2, 3) <-- (2, 2) <-- (2, 1) <-- (2, 0) <-- (1, 0) <-- (0, 0)

Reverse the path to get the solution:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
