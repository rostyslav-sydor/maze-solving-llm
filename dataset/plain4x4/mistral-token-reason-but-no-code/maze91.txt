To solve the given maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices in a graph at the same level before moving on to the next level. In this case, the graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is a coordinate (row, column).

1. First, we initialize a queue and add the origin coordinates to it. We also create a visited set to keep track of the vertices we have already visited.
2. Then, we start a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, we remove the first vertex from the queue and check if it's the target coordinate. If it is, we have found a solution, and we can output the path.
3. If the vertex is not the target coordinate, we add it to the visited set and add its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited yet.
4. We repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or we find the target coordinate. If the queue becomes empty before finding the target coordinate, then there is no path between the origin and target coordinates.

To output the solution, we can use a dictionary to store the parent of each vertex. When we add a vertex to the queue, we set its parent to the current vertex. Then, we can trace back the path from the target coordinate to the origin by following the parent pointers.

Here's how we can apply this algorithm to the given maze:

1. Initialize the queue with the origin coordinates (0, 0) and the visited set with an empty set.
```python
queue = [(0, 0)]
visited = set()
```
1. Start the loop:
	1. Remove the first vertex from the queue: (0, 0)
	2. Check if it's the target coordinate: No, so add it to the visited set.
	```python
	visited.add((0, 0))
	```
	3. Add its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited yet. The neighbors of (0, 0) are (0, 1) and (1, 0), so we add them to the queue and set their parents:
	```python
	queue.append((0, 1))
	queue.append((1, 0))
	```
2. Remove the next vertex from the queue: (0, 1)
	1. Check if it's the target coordinate: No, so add it to the visited set.
	2. Add its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited yet. The neighbors of (0, 1) are (0, 0) and (0, 2), but (0, 0) has already been visited, so we only add (0, 2) to the queue and set its parent:
	```python
	queue.append((0, 2))
	```
3. Repeat this process for all vertices in the queue.
4. Eventually, we will reach the target coordinate (3, 3).
5. To output the solution, we can trace back the path from (3, 3) to (0, 0) by following the parent pointers:
	```python
	path = [(3, 3)]
	current = (3, 3)
	while current != (0, 0):
	    current = parents[current]
	    path.append(current)
	path.reverse()
	```
6. Finally, we can output the path between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:
```python
print(f"<PATH_START> {' '.join(map(str, path))} <PATH_END>")
```
The output should be:
```
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
```
This path represents the sequence of coordinates that the agent must follow to reach the target coordinate starting from the origin.
