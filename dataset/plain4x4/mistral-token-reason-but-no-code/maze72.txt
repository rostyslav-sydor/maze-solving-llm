To find a solution for this maze, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which explores all the adjacent neighbors of a given node before moving to the next level of nodes. This ensures that we find the shortest path between the origin and the target.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for the BFS algorithm:

1. Initialize a queue with the origin node (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Dequeue a node from the queue, and check if it's the target node (3, 3). If it is, we've found the solution, and we can stop.
3. If the dequeued node is not the target, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or we've found the target node.

Now let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. We start with the origin node (0, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 1) and (1, 0).
2. We dequeue (0, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 2) and (1, 1).
3. We dequeue (1, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 1) and (2, 0).
4. We dequeue (0, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 3) and (1, 2).
5. We dequeue (1, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 2) and (2, 1).
6. We dequeue (2, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 1) and (3, 0).
7. We dequeue (0, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 2) and (1, 3).
8. We dequeue (1, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 3) and (2, 2).
9. We dequeue (1, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (1, 2) and (2, 1).
10. We dequeue (2, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 2) and (3, 1).
11. We dequeue (3, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 1) and (2, 0).
12. We dequeue (0, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 3) and (1, 2).
13. We dequeue (1, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3) and (1, 3).
14. We dequeue (2, 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3) and (3, 2).
15. We dequeue (2, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 2) and (3, 1).
16. We dequeue (3, 1) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 2) and (2, 1).
17. We dequeue (3, 0) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 1) and (2, 0).
18. We dequeue (0, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (0, 2) and (1, 3).
19. We dequeue (1, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (2, 3) and (1, 3).
20. We dequeue (2, 3) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: (3, 3).
21. We dequeue (3, 3) and find that it's the target node, so we've found the solution.

Now let's trace the path from the target node (3, 3) back to the origin node (0, 0):

21. (3, 3) was enqueued from (2, 3).
20. (2, 3) was enqueued from (1, 3).
19. (1, 3) was enqueued from (0, 3
