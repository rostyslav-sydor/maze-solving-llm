To solve the maze, we can use A* search algorithm, which is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from the origin to the target. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and the greedy best-first search. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, where the priority is determined by a heuristic function that estimates the cost of reaching the target from the current node.

Here is the reasoning behind the A* algorithm:

1. The algorithm starts at the origin and initializes the priority queue with the origin node.
2. At each iteration, the algorithm selects the node with the lowest priority (i.e., the node with the smallest estimated cost) from the priority queue.
3. If the selected node is the target, the algorithm has found a solution and can stop.
4. Otherwise, the algorithm expands the selected node by considering all of its neighbors. For each neighbor, it calculates the estimated cost of reaching the target from that node.
5. The algorithm then updates the priority queue by adding any new neighbors that were not already in the queue and by updating the priorities of any existing neighbors that have a lower estimated cost.
6. The algorithm repeats steps 2-5 until the target is reached or the priority queue is empty (in which case there is no solution).

Here is a solution for the specific maze in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
