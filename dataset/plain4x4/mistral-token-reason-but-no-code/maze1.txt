To find a solution for the given maze, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from the origin and explores all the neighboring vertices at the present depth before moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:

1. Create a queue (FIFO) and add the origin vertex to the queue.
2. Mark the origin vertex as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the front vertex from the queue.
   b. Iterate through all the adjacent vertices of the current vertex.
     i. If an adjacent vertex has not been visited:
       - Mark it as visited.
       - Add it to the queue.
       - Set the current vertex as its parent.
4. Once the target vertex is dequeued, we can backtrack from the target vertex to the origin vertex by following the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. We create a queue and add the origin vertex (0, 0) to the queue.
2. We mark the origin vertex as visited and set its parent to None.
3. We dequeue the origin vertex (0, 0) from the queue.
4. We iterate through its adjacent vertices: (1, 0) and (0, 1).
5. Since both (1, 0) and (0, 1) have not been visited, we mark them as visited, add them to the queue, and set their parent to (0, 0).
6. We repeat the process for the next vertex in the queue, which is (1, 0).
7. We dequeue (1, 0) from the queue and iterate through its adjacent vertices: (2, 0) and (1, 1).
8. We mark both (2, 0) and (1, 1) as visited, add them to the queue, and set their parent to (1, 0).
9. We continue the process until the target vertex (3, 3) is dequeued from the queue.

Now, let's reconstruct the path from the target vertex (3, 3) to the origin vertex (0, 0) by following the parent pointers:

1. The parent of (3, 3) is (3, 2).
2. The parent of (3, 2) is (3, 1).
3. The parent of (3, 1) is (2, 1).
4. The parent of (2, 1) is (1, 1).
5. The parent of (1, 1) is (1, 2).
6. The parent of (1, 2) is (1, 3).
7. The parent of (1, 3) is (0, 3).
8. The parent of (0, 3) is (0, 2).
9. The parent of (0, 2) is (0, 1).
10. The parent of (0, 1) is (0, 0).

The path from the origin vertex (0, 0) to the target vertex (3, 3) is:
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3)

Output the path in the required format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
