To solve the given maze using the adjacency list representation, we can use a graph search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's use BFS for this explanation.

1. We will start by creating a queue to hold the nodes to be explored and a set to keep track of the visited nodes.
2. We will start the search from the origin node, which in this case is (0,0).
3. We will add the origin node to the queue and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:
	* Dequeue the first node from the queue and check if it is the target node (3,3). If it is, we have found the solution.
	* If it is not the target node, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.
5. If the queue becomes empty and the target node has not been found, there is no solution to the maze.

Now, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the given maze:

1. We start the search from the origin node (0,0). We add (0,0) to the queue and mark it as visited.
2. We dequeue (0,0) and check its neighbors: (1,0) and (0,1). Both are unvisited, so we add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
3. We dequeue (1,0) and check its neighbors: (2,0) and (1,1). Both are unvisited, so we add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
4. We dequeue (0,1) and check its neighbors: (0,0) and (1,1). (0,0) has already been visited, so we only add (1,1) to the queue and mark it as visited.
5. We dequeue (2,0) and check its neighbors: (3,0) and (2,1). Both are unvisited, so we add them to the queue and mark them as visited.
6. We dequeue (1,1) and check its neighbors: (1,0) and (1,2). (1,0) has already been visited, so we only add (1,2) to the queue and mark it as visited.
7. We dequeue (3,0) and check its neighbors: (3,1) and (2,0). (2,0) has already been visited, so we only add (3,1) to the queue and mark it as visited.
8. We dequeue (2,1) and check its neighbors: (2,0) and (2,2). (2,0) has already been visited, so we only add (2,2) to the queue and mark it as visited.
9. We dequeue (1,2) and check its neighbors: (1,1) and (1,3). (1,1) has already been visited, so we only add (1,3) to the queue and mark it as visited.
10. We dequeue (3,1) and check its neighbors: (3,0) and (3,2). (3,0) has already been visited, so we only add (3,2) to the queue and mark it as visited.
11. We dequeue (2,2) and check its neighbors: (2,1) and (3,2). (2,1) has already been visited, so we only add (3,2) to the queue and mark it as visited.
12. We dequeue (1,3) and check its neighbors: (1,2) and (0,3). (1,2) has already been visited, so we only add (0,3) to the queue and mark it as visited.
13. We dequeue (3,2) and check its neighbors: (3,1) and (2,2). Both have already been visited, so we do not add any new nodes to the queue.
14. We dequeue (0,3) and check its neighbors: (1,3) and (0,2). (1,3) has already been visited, so we only add (0,2) to the queue and mark it as visited.
15. We dequeue (0,2) and check its neighbors: (0,3) and (1,2). (0,3) has already been visited, so we do not add any new nodes to the queue.
16. The queue is now empty, and we have not found the target node (
