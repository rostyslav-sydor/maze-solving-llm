Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has a single exit point, which is located at (3,3). To reach the exit point, you can follow the path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

The path has a total of 8 steps.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
