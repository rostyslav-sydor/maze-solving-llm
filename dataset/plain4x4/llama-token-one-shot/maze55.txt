Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze can be solved by starting at the origin (0,0) and following the arrows to reach the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move right (1,0) to reach (1,0).
2. Move down (0,1) to reach (0,1).
3. Move right (1,1) to reach (2,1).
4. Move down (2,2) to reach (2,3).
5. Move right (3,2) to reach (3,3).

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the target, with no need to backtrack or explore dead ends.
