Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has a single exit point at (3,3), and the shortest path to the exit point is as follows:

Starting from the origin (0,0), take the following steps:

1. Move north (up) to (0,1).
2. Move east (right) to (1,0).
3. Move north (up) to (2,0).
4. Move east (right) to (3,0).
5. Move north (up) to (3,1).
6. Move east (right) to (3,2).
7. Move north (up) to (3,3).

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the exit point, with a total of 7 steps.
