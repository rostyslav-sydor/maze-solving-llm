Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze can be solved by starting at the origin (0,0) and following the arrows to the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move right (2,0)
2. Move down (0,1)
3. Move right (2,1)
4. Move down (3,2)
5. Move right (2,2)
6. Move down (3,3)

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the target, with no loops or backtracking.
