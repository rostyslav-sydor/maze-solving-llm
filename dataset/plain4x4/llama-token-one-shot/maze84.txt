Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze can be solved by starting at the origin (0,0) and following the arrows to the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move east (0,0) to (1,0)
2. Move south (1,0) to (2,0)
3. Move east (2,0) to (3,0)
4. Move north (3,0) to (3,1)
5. Move east (3,1) to (3,2)
6. Move north (3,2) to (2,2)
7. Move west (2,2) to (1,2)
8. Move south (1,2) to (1,3)
9. Move west (1,3) to (0,3)
10. Move north (0,3) to (0,2)
11. Move west (0,2) to (0,1)
12. Move north (0,1) to (3,1)
13. Move west (3,1) to (2,1)
14. Move south (2,1) to (2,0)
15. Move west (2,0) to (1,0)
16. Move north (1,0) to (0,0)

The total distance traveled is 16 steps.
