Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has 8 nodes, and the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3) is as follows:

1. (0,0)
2. (1,0)
3. (2,0)
4. (3,0)
5. (3,1)
6. (2,1)
7. (2,2)
8. (3,2)
9. (3,3)

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the target, passing through the nodes in the order listed above.
