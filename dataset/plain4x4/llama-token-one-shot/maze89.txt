Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has 8 nodes, and the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3) is as follows:

1. (0,0)
2. (1,0)
3. (2,0)
4. (3,0)
5. (3,1)
6. (2,1)
7. (2,2)
8. (3,2)
9. (3,3)

Note that the path is represented as a list of coordinates, where each coordinate is a row and column index in the maze. The first coordinate in each pair is the row index, and the second coordinate is the column index.
