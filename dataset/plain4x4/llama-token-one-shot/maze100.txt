Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

[PATH_START] (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) [PATH_END]

The maze has 8 nodes, and the shortest path between the maze's origin (0,0) and target (3,3) is as follows:

1. (0,0)
2. (1,0)
3. (2,0)
4. (3,0)
5. (3,1)
6. (2,1)
7. (2,2)
8. (3,2)
9. (3,3)

Please find the solution in the format you provided, with the first coordinate being the row and the second coordinate being the column.
