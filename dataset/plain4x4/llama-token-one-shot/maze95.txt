Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze can be solved by starting at the origin (0,0) and following the arrows to the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move down (0,0) (1,0)
2. Move right (1,0) (2,0)
3. Move down (2,0) (3,0)
4. Move right (3,0) (3,1)
5. Move up (3,1) (2,1)
6. Move right (2,1) (2,2)
7. Move down (2,2) (3,2)
8. Move right (3,2) (3,3)
9. Move up (3,3) (3,0)
10. Move left (3,0) (2,0)
11. Move up (2,0) (1,0)
12. Move left (1,0) (0,0)

The solution is a simple path that follows the arrows and avoids any dead ends.
