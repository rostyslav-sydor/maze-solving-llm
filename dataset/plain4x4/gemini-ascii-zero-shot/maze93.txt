To find the solution to this maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the entry point, we explore all possible paths one step at a time, until we reach the exit point.

The solution to this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
