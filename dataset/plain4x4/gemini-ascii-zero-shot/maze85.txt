First, we can go right to (1,2).
Then, we can go right again to (1,3).
Then, we can go right again to (1,4).
Next, since we can't go right, we can go down to (2,4).
Then, we can go down again to (3,4).
Now, we can go right to (3,5).
And finally, we can go down to (4,5) and right to reach the exit at (4,6).

So, the solution is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
