First, we move right from the starting point to (1,2). 
Then, we go down to (2,2), then move right to (2,3), down to (3,3), right to (3,4), up to (2,4), right to (2,5), and lastly we go down to (3,5).

So, the complete path is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) <PATH_END>
