To solve this maze, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from the entry point, we can explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point.

Here is the solution for the given maze:

```
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
```
