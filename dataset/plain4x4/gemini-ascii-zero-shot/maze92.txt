* The entry point is at (1,1), so the path must start from there. <PATH_START> (1,1)
* From (1,1) there is only one possible move, which is right to (1,2). (1,2)
* From (1,2) there are two possible moves, but the one going up is a dead end, so the path must go right to (1,3). (1,3)
* From (1,3) there is only one possible move, which is down to (2,3). (2,3)
* From (2,3) there is only one possible move, which is right to (2,4). (2,4)
* From (2,4) there are two possible moves, but the one going up is a dead end, so the path must go down to (3,4). (3,4)
* From (3,4) there are two possible moves, but the one going right is a dead end, so the path must go down to (4,4). (4,4)
* From (4,4) there is only one possible move, which is right to (4,5). (4,5)
* From (4,5) there are two possible moves, but the one going up is a dead end, so the path must go down to (5,5). (5,5)
* From (5,5) there are two possible moves, but the one going left is a dead end, so the path must go down to (6,5). (6,5)
* From (6,5) there are two possible moves, but the one going left is a dead end, so the path must go down to (7,5). (7,5)
* From (7,5) there is only one possible move, which is right to (7,6). (7,6)
* From (7,6) there is only one possible move, which is down to (7,7), the exit point. <PATH_END>

So the solution path is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
