1. From the starting point (1,1), we can move right to (1,2)
2. From (1,2), we can move right again to (1,3)
3. From (1,3), we can move down to (2,3)
4. From (2,3), we can move down again to (3,3)
5. From (3,3), we can move right to (3,4)
6. From (3,4), we can move down to (4,4)
7. From (4,4), we can move down again to (5,4)
8. From (5,4), we can move right to (5,5)
9. From (5,5), we can move down to (6,5)
10. From (6,5), we can move right to (6,6)
11. From (6,6), we can move down to (7,6)
12. Finally, from (7,6), we can move right to the exit point at (7,7)

Therefore, the solution path for the maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
