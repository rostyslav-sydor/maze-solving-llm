1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right until a wall is reached.
3. Move down until a wall is reached.
4. Move right until the next wall is reached.
5. Move up until the next wall is reached.
6. Move right until the intersection with multiple paths.
7. Choose the path that leads to the exit point (7,7).
8. Continue moving until the exit point is reached.
9. Record the path taken from the entry point to the exit point.

The solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
