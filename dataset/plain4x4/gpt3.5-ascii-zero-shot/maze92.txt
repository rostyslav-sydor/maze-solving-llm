First, let's mark the valid paths with dots and walls with hash signs:

#########
#S#.....#
#.#.#.###
#...#...#
#.#.###.#
#.#.....#
#.#######
#.....E#
#########

To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point (7,7). 

One possible solution path could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

We have successfully navigated through the maze by following the valid paths marked with dots. This solution path is just one of the many possible paths that could be taken to reach the exit point in this maze.
