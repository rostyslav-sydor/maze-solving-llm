- Start by moving from (1,1) to (2,1) to avoid the wall
- Move from (2,1) to (3,1) to continue on the path
- Continue moving up to (4,1), then right to (4,2)
- Move up to (4,3) and then right to (4,4)
- Continue moving right to (4,5) and then down to (5,5)
- Move right to (6,5) and then down to (6,6)
- Continue moving right to (6,7) and then down to (7,7) to reach the exit

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
