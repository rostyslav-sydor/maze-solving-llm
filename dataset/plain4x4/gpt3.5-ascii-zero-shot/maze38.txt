First, we can see that the best way to approach this maze is by following the right-hand rule, which means we always keep our right hand on the wall as we navigate through the maze.

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we follow the right-hand rule and navigate through the maze. We take the following path:
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7)

This path leads us to the exit point at (7,7). Therefore, the solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
