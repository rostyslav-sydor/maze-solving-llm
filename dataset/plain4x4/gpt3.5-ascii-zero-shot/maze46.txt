First, we need to explore the maze and find the best path to the exit point. From the starting point at (1,1), we can go right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), (3,2) and (4,2). Then, we can move right to (4,3), (4,4) and up to (3,4). Continuing in this manner, we can ultimately reach the exit point at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution to this maze would be: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
