1. We can start exploring the maze from the entry point (1,1) by moving in different directions while avoiding walls.
2. We can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and finally (7,2) to reach the exit point.
3. The path can be represented as <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2) (6,2) (7,2) <PATH_END>.

This solution successfully navigates through the maze from the entry point to the exit point while avoiding walls.
