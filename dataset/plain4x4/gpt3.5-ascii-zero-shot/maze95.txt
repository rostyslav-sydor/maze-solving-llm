First, we need to explore the maze to find all possible paths from the entry point to the exit point. We can do this by using a depth-first search algorithm or a breadth-first search algorithm.

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
1. Start at the entry point (1,1).
2. Move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2).
3. Move right to (2,3), then down to (3,3).
4. Move right to (3,4), then down to (4,4).
5. Move left to (4,3), then down to (5,3).
6. Move right to (5,4), then down to (6,4).
7. Move down to (7,4), then right to (7,5).
8. Move down to (8,5), then left to (8,4).
9. Move down to (9,4) and reach the exit point (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (8,5) (8,4) (9,4) <PATH_END>.
