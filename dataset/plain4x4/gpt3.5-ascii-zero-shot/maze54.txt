To solve this maze, we can use the depth-first search algorithm. 

Starting from the entry point (1,1), we will explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point (7,7). 

One possible solution is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (5,4) (5,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze, avoiding walls (#), and finally reaches the exit point. 

Depth-first search is a reliable method for solving mazes like this, ensuring that all possible paths are explored until a solution is found.
