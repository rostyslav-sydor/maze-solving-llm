1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and move right (1,2).
2. Continue moving right until you reach the wall at (1,7).
3. Move down to (2,7) and then move left to (2,1).
4. Move up to (1,1) and then move right to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2), right to (2,4), down to (3,4), left to (3,2), up to (2,2).
6. Move right to (2,4), down to (3,4), right to (3,7), down to (4,7), left to (4,1).
7. Move down to (5,1), right to (5,3), up to (4,3), right to (4,6), down to (5,6), left to (5,4) then to (5,7).
8. Finally, move down to reach the exit point at (7,7).

Thus, the solution path for the maze is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,4) (3,4) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
