First, we need to explore the maze to find a path from the entry point to the exit point. We can do this by following a simple rule: always move to an adjacent cell that is not a wall.

Starting at (1, 1), we can move right to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), right to (2, 3), down to (3, 3), right to (3, 4), down to (4, 4), right to (4, 5), down to (5, 5), right to (5, 6), down to (6, 6), right to (6, 7), and finally down to (7, 7) - the exit point.

So, the solution path would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>.
