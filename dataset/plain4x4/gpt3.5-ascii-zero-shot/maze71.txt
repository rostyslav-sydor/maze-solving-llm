First, we need to identify a path from the starting point (1,1) to the ending point (7,7) without crossing any walls. Based on the maze layout, we can see that there are multiple possible paths to reach the exit.

One possible solution is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path moves down initially, then takes a right turn and continues moving until reaching the exit at (7,7). This solution avoids all walls and successfully navigates from the starting point to the ending point.

It's important to note that there may be other possible paths that achieve the same result, but this is one example of a valid solution for the given maze.
