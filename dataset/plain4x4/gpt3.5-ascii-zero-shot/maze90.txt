First, let's explore the maze starting from the entry point (1,1) and try to reach the exit point (7,7). We can denote possible paths as follows: 

Start at (1,1). Move right to (1,2). Then move right again to (1,3). Move down to (2,3), then right to (2,4), down to (3,4), down to (4,4), left to (4,3), down to (5,3), right to (5,4), right to (5,5), up to (4,5), up to (3,5), right to (3,6), up to (2,6), up to (1,6), right to (1,7), down to (2,7), right to (2,8), right to (2,9), down to (3,9), right to (3,10), down to (4,10), right to (4,11), down to (5,11), left to (5,10), down to (6,10), left to (6,9), down to (7,9), and finally right to (7,10) where the exit point (7,7) is located.

Therefore, the solution path can be represented as: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (3,6) (2,6) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (2,8) (2,9) (3,9) (3,10) (4,10) (4,11) (5,11) (5,10) (6,10) (6,9) (7,9) (7,10) <PATH_END>
