First, analyze the maze. From the starting point (1,1), you can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), left to (2,1), down to (3,1), right to (3,2), down to (4,2), right to (4,3), down to (5,3), right to (5,4), down to (6,4), right to (6,5), down to (7,5), right to (7,6), and finally down to the exit point at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path for the maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path follows a logical route through the maze from the starting point to the exit, avoiding the walls (#) and reaching the destination successfully.
