First, we need to explore the maze to find a solution. We can start by going right from the entry point (1,1) and then moving down until we reach the exit point (7,7). 

Here is the solution path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (5,2) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze, avoiding the walls and reaching the exit point successfully.

In summary, the solution path starts at (1,1) and moves right until it reaches the exit point at (7,7), following a path that avoids walls and leads to the end of the maze.
