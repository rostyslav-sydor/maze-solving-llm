First, we need to explore the maze to find the exit. Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can move down until we reach another wall. Then, we can move right until we hit another wall, and continue moving down until we reach the second row. From there, we can move right until we hit the wall at the fourth column, then move up to reach the third row. We can then move right, down, right, down, right, and down to reach the exit at (7,7).

The solution path can be summarized as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (4,6) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
