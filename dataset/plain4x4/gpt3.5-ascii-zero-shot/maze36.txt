First, we need to find a path from the entry point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7) while avoiding the walls. 

Starting from the entry point, we can move down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), down to (3,2), right to (3,3), down to (4,3), right to (4,4), down to (5,4), right to (5,5), down to (6,5), right to (6,6), and finally down to (7,6) and right to (7,7) which is the exit point.

So, the solution path for this maze would be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path avoids all the walls and leads directly to the exit point.
