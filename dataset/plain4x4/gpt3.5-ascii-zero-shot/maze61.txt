First, we need to identify all possible paths from the entry point to the exit point. We can start exploring the maze through different routes, always prioritizing paths that have not been visited yet.

One possible solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we avoid all walls and reach the exit point at coordinate (7,7).

Remember to always mark visited paths to avoid getting stuck in loops. Also, keep in mind that there may be multiple solutions to this maze, so feel free to explore and try different routes until you find the one that works.
