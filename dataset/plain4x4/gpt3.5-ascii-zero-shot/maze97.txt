First, we need to identify all possible paths from the entry point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7). We can start exploring the maze by moving in all four directions - up, down, left, and right. 

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
1. Move right from (1,1) to (1,2)
2. Move right from (1,2) to (1,3)
3. Move down from (1,3) to (2,3)
4. Move down from (2,3) to (3,3)
5. Move down from (3,3) to (4,3)
6. Move right from (4,3) to (4,4)
7. Move right from (4,4) to (4,5)
8. Move right from (4,5) to (4,6)
9. Move right from (4,6) to (4,7)
10. Move down from (4,7) to (5,7)
11. Move down from (5,7) to (6,7)
12. Move right from (6,7) to (6,8)
13. Move down from (6,8) to (7,8)
14. Move left from (7,8) to (7,7)

So, the solution path would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,8) (7,8) (7,7) <PATH_END>
