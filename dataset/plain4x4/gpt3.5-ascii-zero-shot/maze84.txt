To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. Start at the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths until reaching the exit point (7,7).

One possible solution for this maze could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move down until reaching a dead end, then backtrack and explore another path until finally reaching the exit point.

The depth-first search algorithm explores one path as far as possible before backtracking and trying another path. This approach ensures that we will reach the exit point while exploring all possible paths.

By following this solution, we can navigate through the maze from the entry point to the exit point successfully.
