First, let's explore the maze and see if there is a possible solution. We can see that there are multiple paths that can potentially lead to the exit point.

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we can move down to (2,1) and then to (3,1). From there, we can either move right to (3,2) or continue downwards to (4,1). Continuing with the latter option, we can then go right to (4,2), down to (5,2), right to (5,3), down to (6,3) and finally right to (6,4).

At this point, we have reached a dead end. Therefore, let's backtrack to (5,3) and explore the other option at (4,2). From (4,2), we can go right to (4,3), down to (5,3), right to (5,4), down to (6,4) and right to (6,5), downwards to (7,5) and finally right to (7,6) which is our exit point.

Therefore, the solution to this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) <PATH_END>
