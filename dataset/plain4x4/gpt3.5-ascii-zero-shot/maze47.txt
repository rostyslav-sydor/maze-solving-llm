First, we need to explore the maze to find a path from the start point (1,1) to the end point (7,7). We can start by marking our current location and then exploring all possible adjacent paths.

One possible solution for this maze is:
(PATH_START) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) (PATH_END)

In this solution, we move down until we reach row 4, then move right until we reach column 4, then move down again until we reach the exit point (7,7).

This solution avoids any walls and successfully navigates from the start point to the exit point using a series of coordinated moves.

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
