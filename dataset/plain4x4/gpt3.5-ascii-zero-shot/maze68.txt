First, we can start from the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited. Then, we can explore all possible paths from this point, following the right-hand rule (always turn right when possible). 

By following this right-hand rule, we can navigate through the maze and reach the exit point (7,7). The solution path would be as follows: 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (2,4) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path takes us from the entry point to the exit point, navigating around the walls and obstacles in the maze. By following the right-hand rule, we can ensure that we always find a way through the maze to the exit point.
