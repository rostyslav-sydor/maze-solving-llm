1. Start from the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6).
3. Move down to (2,6), then right to (2,7), and down to (3,7).
4. Move left to (3,6), then down to (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6).
5. Move up to (6,5), then left to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and (6,1).
6. Move down to (7,1), then right to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), and (7,6).
7. Finally, move up to the exit point (7,7) and mark it as visited.

So the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (6,2) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
