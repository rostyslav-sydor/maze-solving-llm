Step 1: Start at the entrance (1,1) and mark it as visited. 
Step 2: Explore adjacent cells (1,2) and (2,1) since they are not walls. 
Step 3: Move to cell (1,2) and mark it as visited. 
Step 4: Explore adjacent cells (1,3), (2,2), and (2,1). 
Step 5: Move to cell (1,3) and mark it as visited. 
Step 6: Explore adjacent cells (1,4) and (2,3). 
Step 7: Repeat steps of exploring and moving until you reach the exit at (7,7) 
Step 8: Record the path taken from entrance to exit in the format <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) ... (7,7) <PATH_END>.

The final solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
