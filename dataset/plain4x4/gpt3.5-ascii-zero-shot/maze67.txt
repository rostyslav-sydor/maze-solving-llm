1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore the neighboring cells and choose one to move to, marking it as visited as well.
3. Repeat the process until reaching the exit point (7,7).
4. To find the solution, backtrack from the exit point to the entry point, marking the path taken.
5. Here is a possible solution path: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (3,6) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
6. The path above follows the open spaces in the maze to reach the exit point while avoiding the walls.
