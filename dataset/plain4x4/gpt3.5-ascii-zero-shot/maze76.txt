We can start at the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths while avoiding walls. 
One possible solution for this maze would be to move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), then move down to (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), then move left to (7,7) which is the exit point. 
So the solution path would be: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) (2,8) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) (7,7) <PATH_END>
