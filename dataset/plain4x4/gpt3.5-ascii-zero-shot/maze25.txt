First, let's explore the maze to find the possible paths that can be taken. We will mark the explored paths with dots and the walls with hash signs.

Starting from (1,1) we can move right to (1,2) and then down to (2,2). From there, we have multiple options. We can continue down to (3,2) and then right to (3,3) and down to (4,3) or we can try going left to (2,2) and then down to (3,2) and so on.

Continuing this process, we can eventually find a path that leads us to the exit at (7,7). We can list the coordinates of this path within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Here is a possible solution:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Remember to always check for dead ends and backtrack if needed to find the correct path to the exit.
