1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right (1,2) and mark it as visited.
3. Move down to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) and mark them as visited.
4. Move right to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) and mark them as visited.
5. Move down to (5,6) and mark it as visited.
6. Move left to (5,5) and then up to (4,5) and mark them as visited.
7. Move right to (4,6) and up to (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) and mark them as visited.
8. Move up to (1,5) and mark it as visited.
9. Move right to (1,6) and then down to (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) and mark them as visited.
10. Move up to (2,4) and then right to (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) - the exit point (7,7).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (3,6) (2,6) (2,5) (1,5) (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) <PATH_END>
