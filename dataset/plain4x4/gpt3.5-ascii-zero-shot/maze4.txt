First, we need to find a way from the start point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7). 

One possible solution for this maze could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move down the first column until we reach the fifth row. Then we move right until the exit point is reached.

This solution is just one possible path through the maze. There could be multiple ways to solve it depending on the choices made at each intersection. 

It is important to remember that mazes can have multiple solutions, so there may be other valid paths that can be taken to reach the exit point.
