First, let's start from the entry point at (1,1). We can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), and so on until we reach the exit point at (7,7). Following this path, we can successfully navigate through the maze while avoiding the walls.

Continuing this pattern, the solution for the maze in coordinate format would look like this:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (6,2) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path follows a systematic approach of moving right until reaching a wall, then moving down to avoid the obstacle, and continuing until finally reaching the exit point. We successfully solve the maze by traversing through it step by step.
