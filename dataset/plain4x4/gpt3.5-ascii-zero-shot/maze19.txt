1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and explore the adjacent squares. 
2. Move to the right (1,2) and continue exploring.
3. Move down (2,2) and then right (2,3).
4. Continue moving down until you reach the bottom wall, then move right until you reach the right wall.
5. Move up until you reach the top wall, then move left towards the exit point (7,7).
6. Once you reach the exit point, mark this path as the solution.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
