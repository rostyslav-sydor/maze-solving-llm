We can start by exploring the maze using a depth-first search algorithm. We can keep track of the visited cells and the path taken so far.

Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can move in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and check if the neighboring cell is not a wall and has not been visited before. If we reach the exit point (7,7), we have found our solution.

As we explore the maze, we can mark the visited cells and update our path. We should backtrack if we reach a dead-end or if we reach a visited cell.

Here is a possible solution path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (3,4) (5,4) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the entry point to the exit point.

By following this approach, we can find a solution for the given maze.
