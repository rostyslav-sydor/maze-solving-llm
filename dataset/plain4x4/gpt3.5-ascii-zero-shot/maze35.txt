First, we need to always prioritize moving in the order of up, right, down, left. So we will try to move up, right, down, left as much as possible until we hit a wall.

Following this strategy, we can move from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1). At this point, we have hit a dead end.

So we need to backtrack and try a new path. We can then move from (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (7,3) to (7,4) to (7,5) to (7,6) to (7,7), which is the exit point.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>.
