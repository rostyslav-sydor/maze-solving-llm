First, let's start from the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths using a depth-first search algorithm. We can move in four directions - up, down, left, and right - as long as there's no wall blocking our way.

As we explore each path, we mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them. We continue this process until we reach the exit point (7,7).

By following this algorithm, we can find the solution to the maze. Once the solution is found, we can list the coordinates of the path taken between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

The final output will look something like this:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This represents the path taken from the entry point to the exit point in the maze.
