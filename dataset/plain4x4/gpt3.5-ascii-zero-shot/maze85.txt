First, we need to explore the maze to find the best path from the entry point to the exit point. Starting at position (1,1), we can explore in a depth-first manner, marking visited positions and backtracking when hitting a wall or a dead end.

After exploring the maze, we find that the optimal path is as follows:
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)

Thus, the solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze, avoiding any walls and reaching the exit point at coordinate (7,7).
