Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can move right to (1,2). We then move down to (2,2), and continue down to (3,2). From there, we can move right to (3,3), down to (4,3), and then right to (4,4). Moving down to (5,4) and continuing to (6,4), we then go right to (6,5) and finally down to the exit point at (7,5). 

Therefore, the solution path for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (7,5) <PATH_END> 

By following this path, the maze can be successfully navigated from the entry point to the exit point.
