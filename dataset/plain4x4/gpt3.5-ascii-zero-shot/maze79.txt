First, we need to navigate through the maze from the starting point S to the exit point E. As we move through the maze, we should always prioritize paths that are not blocked by walls.

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
Start at (1,1) and move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), down to (3,2), right to (3,3), right to (3,4), down to (4,4), right to (4,5), down to (5,5), right to (5,6), then down to (6,6), and finally right to the exit at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path can be represented as:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the starting point to the exit point without crossing any walls.
