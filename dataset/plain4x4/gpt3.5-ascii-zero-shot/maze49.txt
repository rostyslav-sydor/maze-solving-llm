First, let's analyze the maze. We see that there is a clear path from the start point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7) if we navigate around the walls.

One possible solution is to first move down 6 steps to reach row 7, then move right 6 steps to column 7. This path avoids all the walls and leads directly to the exit.

The solution in coordinate list format would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that we reach the exit while avoiding the walls. This maze was relatively simple, but the solution demonstrates the importance of careful navigation to reach the desired destination.
