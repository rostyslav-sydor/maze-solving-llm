First, let's start from the entry point at (1,1) and explore the possible paths to reach the exit point at (7,7). 

One possible solution for this maze could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To reach the exit point at (7,7), we follow a path that avoids the walls (#) and leads us to the destination. By carefully navigating through the maze, we were able to find our way out by following the coordinates listed above.

Remember, mazes can have multiple solutions, so this is just one possible path among many. The key is to carefully examine the maze and make strategic decisions to navigate through it efficiently.
