First, we need to explore the maze to find a path from the start point to the end point. To do this, we can use a depth-first search algorithm.

Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can move in all possible directions (up, down, left, right) and mark the cells we have visited to avoid repeated visits.

As we move through the maze, we need to continuously check if we have reached the exit point (7,7). If we do, then we have found a solution.

To output the solution in the requested format, we can keep track of the coordinates we have visited along the path from the start point to the end point. Once we reach the exit point, we can list out these coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

By following these steps, we can successfully navigate through the maze and find the solution.
