First, we need to navigate through the maze by following a set of rules. We can start by moving in a specific direction until we hit a wall, then we can turn and continue until we find the exit point.

One possible path for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we start at coordinate (1,1), move down until we reach the exit at (7,7).

It's important to note that there may be multiple valid paths through the maze, but the key is to follow the rules and adapt to the obstacles presented by the walls. Happy exploring!
