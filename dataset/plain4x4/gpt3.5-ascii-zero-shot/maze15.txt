First, we need to explore the maze and find a path from the entry point to the exit point. We can do this by following a certain strategy, such as always choosing the right-hand wall to follow.

Starting from the entry point (1,1), we can move right until we reach a wall. Then, we can turn left and continue until we reach the next intersection. At each intersection, we can continue following the right-hand wall until we reach the exit point (7,7).

Following this strategy, we can find the solution for the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path represents the coordinates of the cells we need to visit in order to reach the exit point while following the right-hand wall strategy.
