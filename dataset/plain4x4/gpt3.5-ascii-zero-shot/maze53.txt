To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. Start at the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths until reaching the exit point (7,7). 

One possible solution would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move down the maze until reaching the bottom row, then move right until reaching the exit point. 

This solution is just one of the many possible paths that can be taken to solve the maze. The depth-first search algorithm will ensure that all possible paths are explored until the exit is reached.
