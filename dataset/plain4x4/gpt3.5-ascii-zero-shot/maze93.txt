First, we need to explore the maze to find the path from the starting point to the exit point. We can do this by following a depth-first search algorithm. Starting at the entrance (1,1), we move in all possible directions (up, down, left, right) until we reach the exit point (7,7).

As we move through the maze, we need to keep track of the visited cells and the path we have taken so far. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try another direction. By following this process, we will eventually reach the exit point.

After finding the path, we can output the coordinates of the path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. The final output will look something like this:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This indicates the coordinates of the path from the starting point to the exit point. The solution may vary depending on the specific path found during exploration of the maze.
