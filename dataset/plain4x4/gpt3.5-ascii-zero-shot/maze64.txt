First, let's explore the maze. From the starting point at (1,1), we can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3). 

From (2,3), we can go down to (3,3), then right to (3,4), down to (4,4), right to (4,5), down to (5,5), right to (5,6), down to (6,6), and finally right to (6,7).

Now, we are at (6,7) and need to reach the exit at (7,7). We can move down to (7,7) to complete the maze.

Therefore, the solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
