Start from the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited. Then, check the adjacent cells and move to the cell that is not a wall and hasn't been visited before. Continue this process until you reach the exit point (7,7).

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path goes down from (1,1) to (4,1), then moves right to (4,6) and finally goes down to reach the exit point at (7,7).

Remember to avoid walls and previously visited cells while searching for the path. You can use algorithms like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search to find the solution efficiently.
