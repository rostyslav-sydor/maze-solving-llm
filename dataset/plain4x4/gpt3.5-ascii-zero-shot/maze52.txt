First, let's explore the maze. From the starting point at (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) and then down to (2,2). From there, we can go left to (2,1) and down to (3,1). Then, we can move right to (3,2), down to (4,2), right to (4,3), and down to (5,3). Next, we can go right to (5,4), up to (4,4), right to (4,5), down to (5,5), and right to (5,6). From (5,6), we can go down to (6,6) and finally right to (6,7) where the exit is located at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) <PATH_END>
