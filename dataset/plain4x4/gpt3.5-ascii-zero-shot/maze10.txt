First, let's start from the entry point (1,1). We can move right, down, or diagonally. 

The first optimal move would be to move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2) as there is a clear path in these directions.

From (4,2), we can go right to (4,3), then right again to (4,4), down to (5,4), and down again to (6,4).

Now, we are at (6,4) and there are only two possible moves - right to (6,5) or down to (7,4). Since (7,4) is closer to the exit, let's choose that path.

Then, we can move right to (7,5), and finally down to the exit at (7,7).

The solution path would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the start point to the exit point while avoiding walls and dead ends.
