First, we need to navigate through the maze while avoiding walls. We can start by moving right until we hit a wall, then move down until we reach the bottom, then move left until we hit another wall, and finally move up to reach the exit.

To represent this path in the format requested, we can start with the entry point (1,1) and move right until (1,7), then move down until (7,7), then move left until (7,1), and finally move up until we reach the exit point (7,7).

So the solution path in the requested format is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) (7,6) (7,5) (7,4) (7,3) (7,2) (7,1) (6,1) (5,1) (4,1) (3,1) (2,1) <PATH_END>
