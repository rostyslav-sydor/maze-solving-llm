1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right to (1,2) and continue moving right until reaching (1,7).
3. Move down to (2,7) and then continue down to (7,7) to reach the exit point.
4. However, we encounter a dead end at (4,7) where a wall blocks our path.
5. Backtrack to the previous junction at (2,7) and take a different route.
6. Move left to (2,1) and then down to (7,1).
7. Move right to (7,2) and then down to (7,7) to successfully reach the exit point.
8. The solution path is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (3,7) (2,7) (2,6) (2,5) (2,4) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
