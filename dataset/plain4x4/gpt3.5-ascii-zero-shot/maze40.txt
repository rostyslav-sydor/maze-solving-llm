First, let's explore the maze and find a possible path from the entrance (S) to the exit (E). 

Looking at the maze, a possible path could be: move right 5 steps, move down 4 steps, move right 2 steps, move down 1 step, and finally move right 1 step to reach the exit.

So the solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

By following this path, one can successfully navigate the maze from start to finish.
