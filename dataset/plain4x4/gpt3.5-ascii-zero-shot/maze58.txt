To solve this maze, we can use the depth-first search algorithm. Start at the entry point (1,1) and explore each possible direction one by one until reaching the exit point (7,7). 

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (6,2) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the entry point to the exit point while avoiding the walls. The depth-first search algorithm ensures that we explore each possible path before backtracking and trying a different one if needed. This method guarantees that we find a solution to the maze without missing any potential routes.
