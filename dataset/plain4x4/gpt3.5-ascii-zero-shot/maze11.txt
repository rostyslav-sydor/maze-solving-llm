First, we need to define the possible moves in the maze: up, down, left, and right. We can navigate through the maze by checking each possible move until we reach the exit point.

Starting from the entry point (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) as it is not a wall. From (1,2), we can move right to (1,3) and then down to (2,3). 

From (2,3), we can continue down to (3,3), then right to (3,4), down to (4,4), and continue moving in this manner until we reach the exit point at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path through the maze can be represented as: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>.
