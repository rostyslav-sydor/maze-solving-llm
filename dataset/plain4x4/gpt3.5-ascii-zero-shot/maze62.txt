1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right to (1,2) as it is a valid path.
3. Move down to (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2) as they are also valid paths.
4. Move right to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (4,6) to reach the bottom right corner of the maze.
5. Move up to (3,6), (2,6), and (1,6) to reach the final path.
6. Move right to (1,7) and reach the exit point at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (3,6) (2,6) (1,6) (1,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
