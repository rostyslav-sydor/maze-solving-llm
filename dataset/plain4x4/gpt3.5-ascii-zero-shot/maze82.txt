First, we need to identify the possible paths through the maze. From the entry point at (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1). However, moving right would lead to a dead end, so let's move down to (2,1).

From (2,1), we can keep moving down to (3,1) or move right to (2,2). Moving right would again lead to a dead end, so let's continue down to (3,1).

From (3,1), we can move right to (3,2) or down to (4,1). Moving right would eventually lead us to the exit point at (7,7). 

Following this path, we can reach the exit point by going through the coordinates: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze and reach the exit point at (7,7).
