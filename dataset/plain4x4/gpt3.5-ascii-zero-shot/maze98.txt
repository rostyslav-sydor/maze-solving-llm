1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right (1,2) and mark it as visited.
3. Move to the right (1,3) and mark it as visited.
4. Move down to (2,3), mark it as visited.
5. Move down to (3,3), mark it as visited.
6. Move to the right to (3,4), mark it as visited.
7. Move down to (4,4), mark it as visited.
8. Move to the left to (4,3), mark it as visited.
9. Move down to (5,3), mark it as visited.
10. Move down to (6,3), mark it as visited.
11. Move to the right to (6,4), mark it as visited.
12. Move down to (7,4), mark it as visited.
13. Move to the right to (7,5), mark it as visited.
14. Move to the right to (7,6), mark it as visited.
15. Move down to the exit point (7,7) and mark it as visited.

So the solution path is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
