First, let's analyze the maze. The starting point is at (1,1) and the exit point is at (7,7). We need to find a path from the starting point to the exit point without crossing any walls (hash signs).

One possible solution for this maze could be as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move downwards until we reach the bottom of the maze, then we move right until we reach the exit point at (7,7). This path avoids all walls and successfully leads from the starting point to the exit.

Another possible solution could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we initially follow the same path as before but then take a different route towards the exit point at (7,7). This path also avoids all walls and successfully leads from the starting point to the exit.

Overall, there could be multiple solutions to this maze, but the key is to navigate through the open spaces without crossing any walls.
