1. Start from the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths.
2. Move to the right until reaching a wall.
3. Move down until reaching another wall.
4. Move right again, then down, then left until reaching the bottom wall.
5. Move up until reaching the top wall, then move right.
6. Continue moving right until reaching the exit point (7,7).
7. The solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (4,6) (4,5) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
