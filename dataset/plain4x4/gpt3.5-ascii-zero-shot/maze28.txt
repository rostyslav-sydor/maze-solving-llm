1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move to the right to coordinate (1,2) and mark it as visited.
3. Move down to coordinate (2,2) and mark it as visited.
4. Move down to coordinate (3,2) and mark it as visited.
5. Move right to coordinate (3,3) and mark it as visited.
6. Move down to coordinate (4,3) and mark it as visited.
7. Move down to coordinate (5,3) and mark it as visited.
8. Move right to coordinate (5,4) and mark it as visited.
9. Move right to coordinate (5,5) and mark it as visited.
10. Move down to coordinate (6,5) and mark it as visited.
11. Move right to coordinate (6,6) and mark it as visited.
12. Move down to coordinate (7,6) and mark it as visited.
13. Move down to the exit point at coordinate (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
