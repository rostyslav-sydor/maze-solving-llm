1. Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we can move down to (2,1).
2. Then, we can move down again to (3,1) and move right to (3,2).
3. Next, we can move right to (3,3) and down to (4,3).
4. From (4,3), we can move right to (4,4) and down to (5,4).
5. Continuing, we move down to (6,4) and then move right to (6,5).
6. From (6,5), we can move right to (6,6) and then down to (7,6).
7. Finally, we move right to (7,7), which is the exit point.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
