1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and mark it as visited.
2. Move right to (1,2), mark as visited and continue to (1,3).
3. Move down to (2,3), mark as visited and continue to (3,3).
4. Move right to (3,4), mark as visited, then down to (4,4) and then right to (4,5).
5. Move down to (5,5), mark as visited, then right to (5,6) and then down to (6,6).
6. Move right to (6,7), mark as visited and reach the exit point at (7,7).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
