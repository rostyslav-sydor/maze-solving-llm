1) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0) via (1,0) <--> (0,0)
2) Move right from (1,0) to (1,1) via (1,1) <--> (1,0)
3) Move right from (1,1) to (1,2) via (1,2) <--> (1,1)
4) Move right from (1,2) to (1,3) via (1,2) <--> (1,3)
5) There is no direct pass down from (1,3) to (2,3), so we need to backtrack to (1,2)
6) There are no another paths in (1,2) so we need to backtrack to (1,1)
7) There are no another paths in (1,1) so we need to backtrack to (1,0)
8) There are no another paths in (1,0) so we need to backtrack to (0,0)
9) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0)
10) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,2) <--> (0,1)
11) Move right from (0,2) to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,2)
12) There is no direct pass up from (0,3) to (1,3), so we need to backtrack to (0,2)
13) There are no another paths in (0,2) so we need to backtrack to (0,1)
14) There are no another paths in (0,1) so we need to backtrack to (0,0)
15) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0) via (1,0) <--> (0,0)
16) Move right from (1,0) to (1,1) via (1,1) <--> (1,0)
17) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1) via (2,1) <--> (1,1)
18) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,1)
19) Move down from (2,2) to (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (2,2)
20) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (3,2)
Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
