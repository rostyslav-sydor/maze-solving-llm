1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2)
3) There is a wall on the right, so move down from (0,2) to (1,2)
4) To the right is the wall, so move down to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,3)
5) Move right from (2,2) to (2,3)
6) To the right is the wall, so move down from (2,3) to (3,3) via (3,2) <--> (3,3)
Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
