1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (0,2) via (0,2) <--> (0,1)
3) There is no direct path down from (0,2) to (1,2), so we need to backtrack to (0,1)
4) Move right from (0,1) to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,1) 
5) There is no direct pass up from (0,3) to (1,3), so we need to backtrack to (0,2)
6) There are no another paths in (0,2) so we need to backtrack to (0,1)
7) There are no another paths in (0,1) so we need to backtrack to (0,0)
8) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0) via (1,0) <--> (0,0) 
9) There is no direct pass right from (1,0) to (2,0), so we need to backtrack to (0,0)
Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) <PATH_END>
