Considering all available ajacencies:
1) Move right from (0,0) to (0,1) via (0,0) <--> (0,1)
2) Move down from (0,1) to (1,1) via (0,1) <--> (1,1)
3) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1) via (1,1) <--> (1,2) and (1,2) <--> (2,2) and (2,2) <--> (2,1)
4) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,1)
5) There is no direct path down from (2,2) to (3,2), so we need to backtrack to (2,1)
6) There is no direct path right from (2,1) to (2,2), so we need to backtrack to (2,0)
7) There are no another path from (2,0), so we need to backtrack to (1,1)
8) There is no direct path down from (1,1) to (2,1), so we need to backtrack to (1,0)
9) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0) via (1,0) <--> (2,0)
10) Move right from (2,0) to (2,1) via (2,0) <--> (2,1)
11) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,1)
12) Move down from (2,2) to (3,2) via (2,2) <--> (2,3) and (2,3) <--> (3,3) and (3,3) <--> (3,2)
13) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (3,2)
Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
