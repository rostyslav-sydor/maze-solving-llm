<Path_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (0,0) and follow the adjacency list provided. We move through the maze by following the connections between the coordinates until we reach the exit point (3,3). The path we take is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). This path avoids any obstacles and successfully navigates the maze from start to finish. By following the connections in the adjacency list, we are able to find the optimal path through the maze.
