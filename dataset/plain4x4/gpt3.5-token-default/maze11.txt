To solve the maze, we can follow these steps:
1. Start at coordinate (0,0) marked with <ORIGIN_START>.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) marked with <TARGET_START>.
3. The path taken is as follows: 
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
4. Total of 6 steps were required to reach the target.
5. The maze has been successfully solved using the provided adjacency list.
