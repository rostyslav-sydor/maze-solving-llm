One possible solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, the path starts at coordinate (0,0), then moves through the maze by following the edges in the adjacency list until it reaches the target at coordinate (3,3). The path takes a route that ensures all necessary edges are traversed to reach the target successfully.

This solution adheres to the constraints provided, keeping the path within the specified maze structure and format.
