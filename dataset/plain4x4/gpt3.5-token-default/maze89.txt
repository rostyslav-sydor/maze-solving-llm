The solution for this maze would be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the origin point (0,0) and moves through the maze following the edges specified in the adjacency list until reaching the target point (3,3). The path consists of moving upwards along the left edge, then moving right towards the top, and finally moving downwards to reach the target.

By following this specific path, one can successfully navigate through the maze from the starting point to the ending point using the connections specified in the adjacency list.
