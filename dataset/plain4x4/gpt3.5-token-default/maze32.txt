The solution for this maze is as follows: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path starts at coordinates (0,0), moves to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) and finally reaches the target at (3,3).

Along the way, the path navigates through the maze according to the adjacency list provided, following the connections between adjacent tokens until it reaches the exit point at (3,3).

The path avoids dead ends and backtracks when necessary, eventually reaching the target point. The <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens mark the beginning and end of the path coordinates list.
