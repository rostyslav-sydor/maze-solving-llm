One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at (0,0) and follows the adjacency list connections to reach the target at (3,3). The steps taken are as follows:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

The path is determined by following the connections between adjacent cells until the target is reached. This solution provides a clear and concise path through the maze within the given constraints.
