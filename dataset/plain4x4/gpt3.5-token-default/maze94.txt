To solve this maze, we can follow the adjacency list provided starting from the origin point (0,0) towards the target point (3,3). By following the edges specified in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze to reach the target point.

The solution path for this maze would be: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows the connections specified in the adjacency list and leads from the origin point to the target point in the maze.

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target point at (3,3).
