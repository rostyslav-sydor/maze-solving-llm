One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinate (0,0) and follows the adjacency list connections until reaching the target at coordinate (3,3). The path moves through the maze based on the specified connections between coordinates in the adjacency list, navigating from one point to the next until reaching the target point.

By following the connections provided in the adjacency list, the path successfully navigates through the maze and reaches the target point at coordinate (3,3).

The path is represented as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with each coordinate indicating a position in the maze where the path moves through.
