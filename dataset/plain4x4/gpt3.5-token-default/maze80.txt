The solution for this maze is as follows: starting from (0,0), the path goes to (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reaches the target at (3,3). The output path in the requested format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze following the adjacency list provided, making the necessary turns to reach the target at (3,3) from the origin at (0,0). The path avoids obstacles and navigates efficiently to reach the target endpoint.
