To solve the maze, you can follow the connections in the adjacency list starting from the origin point (0,0) and moving towards the target point (3,3). By moving through the maze according to the connections specified in the adjacency list, you can navigate your way to the exit point. The path will take you through various coordinates until you reach the target point. Following the specified connections in the graph will lead you to the target point in the maze.
