One possible solution for the maze provided is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution moves through the maze starting from the origin at (0,0) and navigates through the corridors to reach the target at (3,3). The path taken includes turning at intersections and backtracking at dead ends to eventually reach the destination. The coordinates of the path are listed between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as per the requested format. The solution successfully guides from the entry point to the exit point within the maze.
