To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we would need to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). By following the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze by moving from one connected point to another.

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we start at the origin point (0,0), traverse through the maze following the connections indicated in the adjacency list, and finally reach the target point (3,3). The path taken goes through different points in the maze until the destination is reached.

This solution demonstrates a successful path through the maze using the provided adjacency list, showcasing the connectivity of the points in the graph to navigate from the starting point to the target point.
