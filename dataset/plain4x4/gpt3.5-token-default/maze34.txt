<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_End>

To solve the maze, we can follow the following path:
1. Start at coordinate (0,0) and move to (1,0)
2. Go to (1,1), then (1,2), and finally (1,3)
3. Move to (0,3), then (0,2), and (0,1)
4. Return back to (0,0) before moving to (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) and finally reach the target at (3,3).

This path covers all the necessary edges in the maze to reach from the origin point at (0,0) to the target at (3,3). By following this path, the maze can be successfully navigated from start to finish.
