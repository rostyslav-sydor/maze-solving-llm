One possible solution for the maze represented in the adjacency list is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we start at coordinate (0,0) marked as the origin and navigate through the maze by following the edges provided in the adjacency list until reaching coordinate (3,3) marked as the target. The path taken includes moving down to (1,0), then right to (2,0), further right to (2,1), then up to (2,2), and finally right to (2,3) before reaching the target at (3,3).

This path successfully navigates through the maze while following the connections between adjacent coordinates provided in the adjacency list, leading from the origin to the target.
