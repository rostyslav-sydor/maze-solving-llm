The solution for this maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from the starting point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3) by following the connections in the adjacency list. It navigates through the maze by moving from one coordinate to another based on the connections provided in the graph until it reaches the exit point. The path avoids any obstacles or dead ends by sticking to the valid connections specified in the adjacency list. 
Overall, the path successfully traverses the maze from the entry point to the exit point using the provided connections in the adjacency list.
