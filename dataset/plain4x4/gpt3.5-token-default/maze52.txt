The solution for the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To reach from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we need to follow the path by moving right, up, right, up, right, down, and right. This path avoids any loops or dead ends in the maze and finally reaches the target point successfully. The maze can be effectively navigated by following the directions indicated by the adjacency list provided. The solution pathway consists of the optimal route from the origin to the target, ensuring the shortest path possible through the maze.
