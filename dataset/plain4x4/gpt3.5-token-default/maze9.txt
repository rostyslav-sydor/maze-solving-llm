One possible solution for the maze provided is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path starts from the origin at (0,0) and moves right until reaching the top right corner at (0,3). Then it moves downwards, following the path in the adjacency list, until reaching the target at (3,3).
It is important to note that there may be multiple solutions for this maze, depending on the path taken by the traveler. The solution provided is just one of the possible paths.
