One possible solution for this maze is as follows: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. Starting from the origin at (0,0), the path moves right to (1,0), then up to (2,0), followed by another right to (3,0). From there, it goes up to (3,1), continuing right to (3,2), and finally up to reach the target at (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin to the target, avoiding obstacles in its way. The coordinates listed between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens represent the sequence of locations visited along the path.
