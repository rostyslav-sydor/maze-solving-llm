<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_End> 

To solve the maze, we start from the entrance at (0,0) and move through the adjacency list until we reach the exit at (3,3). Following the connections in the adjacency list, we move from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (2,0), then to (3,0), then to (3,1), and finally to (3,2) before reaching (3,3) which is the exit point. This path successfully navigates through the maze from the entrance to the exit point. The path taken is represented in the output between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as mentioned. Overall, the solution outlines the sequence of coordinates that lead from the starting point to the target point, demonstrating a successful path through the maze.
