One possible solution for the maze described in the adjacency list is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinate (0,0) and follows the edges in the adjacency list to reach the target at coordinate (3,3). The path moves from one node to another based on the connections defined in the adjacency list until it reaches the target node. The solution path avoids any dead ends or loops by following the connected nodes in the correct order.

By following this path, the maze is successfully navigated from the starting point to the target point, demonstrating a valid solution.
