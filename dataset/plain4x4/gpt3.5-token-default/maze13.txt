To find a solution for this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Starting from the origin at (0,0) and moving towards the target at (3,3), we can find a path that leads through the maze.

One possible solution for this maze could be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we start at (0,0), move towards the target at (3,3) while avoiding obstacles or dead ends, and eventually reach the target. The path is represented as a list of coordinates in the format indicated.

By following this path, we can successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target.
