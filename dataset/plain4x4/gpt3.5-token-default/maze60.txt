The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the origin at (0,0), we move to (0,1), then to (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and finally reach the target at (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze according to the provided adjacency list. It avoids dead ends and loops to reach the target efficiently. The path represents a series of moves from one cell to another until reaching the destination. By following the specified connections in the adjacency list, we can traverse through the maze from the origin to the target.
