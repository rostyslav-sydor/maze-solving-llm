A possible solution for this maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at (0,0) and follows the adjacency list connections to reach the target at (3,3). It moves from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0) to (3,1) to (3,2) and finally to (3,3). This path avoids any dead ends or loops by following the defined connections in the adjacency list.

This solution follows a simple path along the edges of the maze to reach the target, avoiding any unnecessary turns or backtracking. The coordinates of the path are listed between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
