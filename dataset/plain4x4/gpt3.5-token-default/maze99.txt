To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to navigate from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). By following the specified connections in the adjacency list, we can reach the target point.

One possible path to solve the maze is as follows: 
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0)
- Move to (1,1)
- Move to (1,2)
- Move to (1,3)
- Move to (2,3)
- Move to (3,3)

Therefore, the solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that we follow the connections provided in the adjacency list to reach the target point. By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze to the desired destination.
