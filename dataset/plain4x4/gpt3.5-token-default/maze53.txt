To solve the maze provided, we can start at the origin (0,0) and follow the path to reach the target (3,3). By following the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze by moving from one connected cell to another until we reach the target.

One possible solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), then to (0,3), and continue following the path until we reach the target at (3,3).

Following this path through the maze will lead us from the origin to the target, and the output in the format provided between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens shows the coordinates of the cells we pass through to reach the destination.
