The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at (0,0), moves right to (1,0), then down to (2,0), further down to (3,0), then right to (3,1), down to (3,2), and finally right to (3,3) which is the target point.

Following this path will successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target within the given adjacency list representation.
