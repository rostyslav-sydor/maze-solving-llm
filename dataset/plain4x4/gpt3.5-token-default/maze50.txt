The solution for this maze can be found by following these coordinates:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the origin at (0,0), move to (1,0), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), finally reaching the target at (3,3). This path avoids obstacles and follows the adjacency list connections provided. The total number of steps taken is 6, leading from the origin to the target in the maze.
