One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path follows the connections specified in the adjacency list starting from the origin point (0,0) and reaching the target point (3,3). By navigating through the maze according to the connections provided, the path successfully moves from one point to another until reaching the target point. The path avoids any dead ends or loops, ensuring a direct route to the destination. The coordinates in the path list the rows and columns that must be traversed in the maze to reach the target point.
