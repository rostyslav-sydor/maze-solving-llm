To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search. Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can explore all possible paths until we reach the target at (3,3).

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally reach (0,3). From there, we move down to (1,3), then (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3).

This path represents the shortest route to navigate through the maze from the origin to the target, following the connections provided in the adjacency list.
