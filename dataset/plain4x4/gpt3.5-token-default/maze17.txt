The solution for this maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinates (0,0), moves to (1,0), then (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) and finally reaches the target at (3,3). This path navigates through the adjacency list connecting each adjacent coordinate until reaching the target. The <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens mark the start and end of the coordinate list, respectively, providing a clear indication of the path taken in the maze.
