Solution to the maze is as follows: 
Starting from (0,0), the path is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) 

So, the output in the requested format is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the path taken from the starting point to the ending point in the maze.
