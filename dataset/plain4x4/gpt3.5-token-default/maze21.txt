One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at (0,0) and follows the adjacency list connections to reach the target at (3,3). It moves right to (0,1), then up to (0,2), following the path to (1,2), (2,2), and finally reaching the target at (3,2) and (3,3).

By following the connections in the adjacency list, the path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin to the target, traversing the rows and columns based on the specified connections.
