Based on the provided adjacency list, the solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path starts at (0,0) and navigates through the maze until reaching the target at (3,3). The movement is described by moving one step at a time either horizontally or vertically based on the connections in the adjacency list. The path successfully avoids any potential dead ends or loops to reach the target.

Overall, the solution demonstrates an efficient way to traverse the maze from the origin to the target using the provided adjacency list.
