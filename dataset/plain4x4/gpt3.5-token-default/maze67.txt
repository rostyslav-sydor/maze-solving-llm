The solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from (0,0), the path follows the adjacency list connections until reaching the target at (3,3). The path moves from row 0 to row 1, then to row 2, and finally reaching row 3 where the target is located. Each coordinate in the path list corresponds to a move in the maze based on the connections specified in the adjacency list. The solution avoids any dead ends and follows a continuous path from the origin to the target. By following this sequence of coordinates, the maze can be successfully navigated from the starting point to the ending point.
