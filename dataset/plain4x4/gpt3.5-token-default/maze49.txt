The solution for the given maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at (0,0) and moves to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reaches the target at (3,3). This path follows the adjacency list provided where each coordinate corresponds to a cell in the maze grid. By traversing the graph based on the adjacency list, the path from the origin to the target is successfully identified.

The path is represented between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with each coordinate indicating a move to the adjacent cell either vertically or horizontally. The path solution efficiently navigates from the starting point to the ending point while avoiding obstacles and following the specified connections in the adjacency list.
