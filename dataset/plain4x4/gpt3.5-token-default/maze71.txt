The solution for this maze is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. 
This path starts at the origin (0,0), moves through the maze, and finally reaches the target (3,3). 
The maze can be navigated by following the connections between adjacent cells as defined in the adjacency list. 
The path travels through various cells until reaching the target. 
By following the sequence of coordinates in the path, the maze can be successfully solved.
