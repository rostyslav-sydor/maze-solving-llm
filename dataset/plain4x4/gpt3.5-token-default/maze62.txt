The solution for the maze described can be found by following the path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3). This path starts at the origin point (0,0) and ends at the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the output in the requested format would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the coordinates of the path from the origin to the target in the maze.
