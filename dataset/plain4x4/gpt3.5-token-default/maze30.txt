To solve this maze, we can follow the given adjacency list to find the path from the starting point (0, 0) to the ending point (3, 3). The path can be traced as follows: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3).

Therefore, the solution for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the coordinates of the path from the starting point to the ending point. By following this path, you can successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target destination.
