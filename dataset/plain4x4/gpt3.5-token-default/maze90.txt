One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts from the origin point at (0,0) and moves towards the target point at (3,3) by following the adjacency list connections provided. It passes through the maze by navigating through the available connections until it reaches the target point. The path avoids dead ends and backtracks by following valid connections to move towards the target efficiently. The solution path is represented as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with each coordinate indicating a move to an adjacent cell in the maze.
