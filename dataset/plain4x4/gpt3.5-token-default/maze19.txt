One possible solution for the maze is to move from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3) through the following path: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves through the maze by following the edges defined in the adjacency list given. Starting from (0,0), it moves right to (1,0), then down to (2,0), right to (2,1), down to (2,2), right to (2,3), and finally down to reach the ending point at (3,3).

This solution successfully navigates from the starting point to the ending point while following the edges defined in the adjacency list provided.
