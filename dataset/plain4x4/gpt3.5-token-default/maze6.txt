The solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To reach the target at (3,3) from the origin at (0,0), we follow the path through the maze starting from the origin and moving through the adjacent cells in the specified order until we reach the target. The path consists of moving in a zigzag pattern from the origin to the target, following the edges defined in the adjacency list representation of the maze. The final coordinates of the path are listed between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. The path traverses through the maze efficiently to reach the target in the minimum number of steps, satisfying the conditions of the maze.
