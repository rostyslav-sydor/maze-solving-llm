The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinate (0,0) and follows the edges in the adjacency list to reach the target at (3,3). The maze is navigated by moving through the coordinates in the listed order until reaching the target, following the connections between adjacent coordinates. This path is the shortest route from the origin to the target in this maze.
