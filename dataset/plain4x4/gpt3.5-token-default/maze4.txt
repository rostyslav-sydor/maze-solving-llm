The solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path starts at the origin (0,0) and moves towards the target (3,3) by following the edges specified in the adjacency list provided. It avoids dead ends and loops to reach the destination efficiently. The path consists of moves along rows and columns until it reaches the target point. By following this sequence of coordinates, the maze can be successfully navigated and solved.
