The solution to the maze is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path starts at the origin (0,0), moves to the right, then upwards until reaching the target (3,3). The path avoids obstacles and follows the adjacency list provided to navigate through the maze efficiently. By following this path, the target is successfully reached from the origin in 7 steps. Each pair of coordinates represents a move in either the row or column direction. The solution illustrates the path that needs to be taken to navigate through the maze from the entrance to the exit.
