To solve this maze, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Traversing through the adjacency list provided, we can create a graph and calculate the shortest path.

The path from (0,0) to (3,3) would be: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to (0,3) to (1,3) to (2,3) and finally to (3,3).

By following this path, one can successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the given maze.
