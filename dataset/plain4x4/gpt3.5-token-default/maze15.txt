One possible solution for the maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the origin point (0,0) and follows the adjacency list connections to reach the target point (3,3). The coordinates in the path represent the rows and columns of the maze that need to be traversed to reach the target. By following the connections in the adjacency list, the path avoids obstacles and reaches the target point efficiently. The path ensures that the maze is solved successfully while adhering to the rules and limitations set by the maze structure.
