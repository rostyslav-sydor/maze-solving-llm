To solve this maze, we can follow the path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). One possible path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves right from (0,0) to (0,1), then upward to (0,2) and (0,3). From there, it turns right to (1,3), then continues right to (2,3) and finally reaches the target point (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin to the target using the connections provided in the adjacency list.

By following the specified path, we can move from the starting point to the target point efficiently. The path has been represented in the format requested with each coordinate listed between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
