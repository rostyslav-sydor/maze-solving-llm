The solution for the maze can be found by following the path from the starting point at (0,0) to the ending point at (3,3). The path is as follows: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

To reach the ending point, the path navigates through the adjacency list connections provided. It goes from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,0), and finally reaches (3,3) to complete the maze.

Following this path will successfully lead from the starting point to the ending point, passing through each specified coordinate along the way.
