The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To navigate through the maze, the path starts at coordinate (0,0) and moves to (1,0), then to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), and finally to (3,2) before reaching the target at (3,3). The path avoids dead ends and successfully reaches the target at the end of the maze.
