To solve the maze, we can follow the path from the origin point at (0,0) to the target point at (3,3). The path can be traced as follows:

- Start at (0,0) and move to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally to (0,3).
- From (0,3), move to (1,3) and then to (2,3).
- Next, move from (2,3) to (3,3), reaching the target point.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate from the origin to the target point in the maze.
