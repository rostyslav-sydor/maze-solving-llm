<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_End> 

To solve the maze starting from (0,0) and reaching (3,3), we can follow the path: move right from (0,0) to (1,0), then go up to (2,0), followed by moving right again to (3,0). From (3,0), move down to (3,1) and then traverse to (3,2) by moving right. Finally, go down to reach the destination at (3,3). This path ensures reaching the target while following the specified adjacency list constraints. The path coordinates are enclosed within the <Path_Start> and <Path_End> tokens for clarity.
