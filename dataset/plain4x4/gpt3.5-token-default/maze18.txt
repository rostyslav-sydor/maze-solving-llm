The solution to the maze can be found by following the path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided. 

The path starts at (0,0), moves to (1,0), then to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), and finally reaches the target point at (3,3). 

Therefore, the output in the format of a coordinate list would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the path through the maze that leads from the starting point to the target point.
