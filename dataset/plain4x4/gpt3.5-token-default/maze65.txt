To solve the maze provided, we can start from the origin at (0, 0) and perform a depth-first search to reach the target at (3, 3). By following the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze to find the path to the target.

Here is the path from the origin to the target:
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (1, 1) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

Following this path will lead us from the origin to the target through the maze. The depth-first search algorithm ensures that we explore all possible paths until we reach the target coordinates.
