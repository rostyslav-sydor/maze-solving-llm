To solve this maze, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as A* search. Starting from the origin point (0,0) and moving towards the target point (3,3), we can find the shortest path through the maze. 

The path will be: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from left to right along the bottom row, then up the right side, and finally across the top row to reach the target point. By following this sequence of coordinates, we can navigate through the maze and reach the target point efficiently.

Using the given adjacency list, the algorithm will traverse through the maze by moving from one connected node to another until it reaches the target point, following the shortest path possible.
