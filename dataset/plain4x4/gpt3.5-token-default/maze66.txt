To solve the maze provided, we can follow the path through the adjacency list starting from the origin point (0,0) towards the target point (3,3). The possible path based on the adjacency list is:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the solution for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following these coordinates, we can successfully navigate from the origin to the target point while adhering to the connections in the maze. This path covers all necessary points to reach the exit successfully.
