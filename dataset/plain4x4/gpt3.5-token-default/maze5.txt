To solve this maze, we can follow the adjacency list provided. Starting from the origin at (0, 0), we can move through the maze by following the connections between the nodes. We need to navigate through the nodes until we reach the target at (3, 3).

Following the connections provided in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze and reach the target. The path will be as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the path from the origin to the target in the maze. By following the connections between the nodes, we successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target at (3, 3).
