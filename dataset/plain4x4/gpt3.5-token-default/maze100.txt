One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the origin (0,0), we navigate through the maze by following the adjacency list provided. We move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) and finally reach the target at (3,3). This path ensures that we reach the target while exploring the maze effectively.

By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the maze provided. This solution utilizes the given adjacency list to determine the path of traversal, guiding us from one point to the next until reaching the target (3,3).
