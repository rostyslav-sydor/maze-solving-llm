To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search. Starting at the origin (0,0), we can explore the graph by following the edges until we reach the target (3,3).

One possible solution for this maze could be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) and finally reach the target at (3,3).

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target. This solution demonstrates one possible route through the maze, but there may be other valid paths as well.
