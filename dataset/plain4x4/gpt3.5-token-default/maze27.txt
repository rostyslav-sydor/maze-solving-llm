One possible solution for this maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinate (0,0) and moves down to (1,0), then to (2,0), followed by (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), and finally reaches the target at (3,3). This path follows the adjacency list provided and successfully navigates through the maze to reach the target.

It is important to note that there can be multiple paths that lead to the target in a maze, and the solution provided above is just one of them. The choice of path can vary depending on different factors such as the decision-making algorithm used, restrictions imposed by the maze layout, and other variables that can impact the pathfinding process.
