The solution to the provided maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path goes from the starting point at (0,0) to the ending point at (3,3), following the adjacency list connections provided. Each coordinate represents a step in the path through the maze. The path starts by moving from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (2,0) and (2,1). From there, it moves to (2,2) and (3,2), finally reaching the target at (3,3). The path avoids dead ends and backtracks to successfully reach the exit point. This solution is represented by the coordinate list enclosed between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
