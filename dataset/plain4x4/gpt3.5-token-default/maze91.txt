The solution to the maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (0,0), goes right to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally to (0,3). From there, it moves down to (1,3), then to (2,3), and finally reaches the target at coordinate (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin to the target.

Remember that the coordinates represent the row and column numbers of each cell in the maze. The path is represented by the sequence of coordinates between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
