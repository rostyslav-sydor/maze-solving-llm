<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <Path_End> 

The solution above navigates through the maze from the starting point at (0,0) to the target point at (3,3) by following the listed coordinates. It moves both horizontally and vertically, making the necessary turns at the intersections to reach the destination. The path avoids any obstacles and reaches the target efficiently.
