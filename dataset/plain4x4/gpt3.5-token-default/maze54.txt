<Path_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is to start from (0,0), move to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3). This path avoids dead ends and obstacles, following the adjacency list provided. By following this path, the maze can be successfully navigated from the origin to the target.
