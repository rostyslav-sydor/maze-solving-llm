The solution for the given maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the origin at (0,0), the path moves from one cell to another according to the adjacency list provided until reaching the target at (3,3). The path avoids obstacles and follows the specified connections between cells to reach the destination. The final path is represented as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
