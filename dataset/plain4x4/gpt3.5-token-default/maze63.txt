<Path_start> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_end>

To solve this maze, we can follow the path: go right, up, up, left, up, left, down, right, right, down. This path leads us from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), passing through the maze without hitting any walls. By following these steps, we successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target point. This path ensures that we do not backtrack or get stuck in any dead ends, allowing us to efficiently traverse the maze and reach the exit point.
