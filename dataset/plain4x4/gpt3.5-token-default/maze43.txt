To solve this maze, we can start at coordinate (0,0) and traverse through the adjacency list until we reach coordinate (3,3). By following the connections given, the path to the target can be found as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2) and finally reaches the target at (3,3). The solution provides a clear route through the maze from the starting point to the destination.
