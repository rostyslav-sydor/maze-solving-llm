One possible solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinates (0,0) and moves to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) and finally reaches the target at (3,3). This path follows the edges provided in the adjacency list from the origin to the target. The path avoids dead ends and loops by following the correct connections between the nodes. This solution successfully navigates through the maze to reach the target while adhering to the adjacency graph representation.
