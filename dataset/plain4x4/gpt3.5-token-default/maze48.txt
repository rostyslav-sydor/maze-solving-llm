The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at (0,0) and moves to (1,0), then (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) and finally reaches the target at (3,3).

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the starting point to the ending point, following the connections specified in the adjacency list.

The path is represented as a list of coordinates in the format (row, column), enclosed within <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
