One possible solution for this maze is to follow the path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3). This path ensures reaching the target at (3,3) from the origin at (0,0) while following the connections provided in the adjacency list. The output in the requested format would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, one can successfully navigate through the maze from the starting point to the destination point.
