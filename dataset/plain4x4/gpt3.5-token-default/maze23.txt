To solve this maze, we can follow the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) through the adjacency list provided. By tracing the connections given, the solution path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Following this path will lead us from the origin point to the target point in the maze. The solution is represented by a list of coordinates as shown above, with each pair of coordinates indicating a move from one position to another in the maze.
