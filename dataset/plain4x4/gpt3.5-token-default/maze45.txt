<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <Path_End>

The solution for this maze starts at coordinate (0,0) and moves to (1,0), then (1,1), (1,2), and finally (1,3) to reach the target at coordinate (3,3). This path avoids dead ends and loops by following the adjacency list provided. The maze is successfully navigated by always moving to the adjacent cell with the lowest row and column values until reaching the target cell. The solution path is represented by the coordinates listed between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
