One possible solution for the maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts from coordinate (0,0), follows the edges in the adjacency list provided, and reaches the target coordinate (3,3) by moving through the maze. The solution outlines the path taken by listing each coordinate visited in order between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. Other possible paths may exist, but this is one valid solution.
