To solve the maze, we start at the origin (0,0) and navigate through the adjacency list until we reach the target (3,3). The path to follow is as follows:
 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0), then moves to (3,1), (3,2), and finally reaches the target at (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin to the target according to the provided adjacency list.

Remember, each coordinate represents a different cell in the maze grid where rows and columns are indexed starting from 0.
