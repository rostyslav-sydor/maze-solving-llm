<Path_Start> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze, we start at (0,0) and move through the adjacency list connecting neighboring nodes until we reach the target at (3,3). The path we take is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). This path follows the edges specified in the adjacency list and leads us from the origin to the target. By following the specified connections, we successfully navigate through the maze and reach the exit point.
