The solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path is determined by following the adjacency list connections starting from the origin point (0,0) and navigating through the maze until reaching the target point (3,3). Each coordinate in the path represents a move from one cell to another as per the adjacency list connections provided.

This solution provides the shortest path from the origin to the target in the maze represented by the adjacency list. The path is traversed in a sequential manner following the connections specified in the adjacency list.
