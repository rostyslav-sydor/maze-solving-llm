One possible solution for this maze would be as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path starts at coordinate (0,0) and follows the edges in the adjacency list to reach the target at coordinate (3,3). The path moves in a straight line towards the right, then goes down to reach the target. This solution avoids any loops or dead ends, providing an efficient way to navigate through the maze. By following the edges as specified in the adjacency list, the path successfully reaches the target within the maze.
