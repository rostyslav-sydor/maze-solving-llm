The solution for this maze is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To navigate the maze, start at coordinate (0,0) and move to (1,0), then to (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) to reach the target (3,3). The path taken follows the adjacency list provided and ensures that each coordinate is visited only once. The solution path is the shortest route from the origin to the target, as determined by the given connections in the adjacency list. It successfully passes through all necessary points to reach the destination at (3,3).
