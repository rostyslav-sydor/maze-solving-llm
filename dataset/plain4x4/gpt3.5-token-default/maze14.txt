To solve this maze, we can use depth-first search algorithm. Starting from (0,0), we explore all possible paths until we reach the target point at (3,3). Here is the path found:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves right, down, right, up, right, down and right to reach the target point. By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin point to the target point. This solution demonstrates the effectiveness of depth-first search in solving maze problems efficiently.
