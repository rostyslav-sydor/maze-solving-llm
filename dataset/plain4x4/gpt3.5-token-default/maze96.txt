The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the origin at (0,0), we move right until reaching the target at (3,3) by following the connections provided in the adjacency list. We traverse through the maze in a way that allows us to reach the target without hitting any dead ends or loops. The path found ensures that we reach the target point (3,3) from the origin point (0,0) in the most efficient manner possible. Following the specified path coordinates will guide you through the maze successfully.
