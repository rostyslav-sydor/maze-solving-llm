The solution for the given maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), following the connections outlined in the adjacency list. The path avoids any obstacles and reaches the target point successfully.
