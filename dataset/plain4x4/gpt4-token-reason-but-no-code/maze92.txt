To solve the maze presented, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list defines which cells in the maze are directly connected, allowing movement between them. 

Starting from the entry point (0,0), we trace a path towards the exit (3,3) using the provided connections:

1. From (0,0), we can move to (1,0) since (1,0) <--> (0,0) is in the list.
2. From (1,0), we proceed to (1,1) using (1,0) <--> (1,1).
3. From (1,1), we jump to (1,2) due to the connection (1,1) <--> (1,2).
4. Continuing from (1,2), we move to (1,3) as indicated by (1,2) <--> (1,3).
5. From (1,3), we can directly move to (2,3), shown by (2,3) <--> (1,3).
6. From (2,3), we head to (2,2) using the connection (2,2) <--> (2,3).
7. Then, from (2,2), we move to (2,1) with (2,1) <--> (2,2).
8. Now, connect (2,1) to (2,0) as suggested by (2,0) <--> (2,1).
9. After reaching (2,0), we go towards (3,0) via (3,0) <--> (2,0).
10. From (3,0), move to (3,1) as (3,0) <--> (3,1) is a connection.
11. Transition from (3,1) to (3,2) following the connection (3,1) <--> (3,2).
12. Finally, from (3,2), reach the target at (3,3) with the path (3,2) <--> (3,3).

Thus, the entire path from the origin to the target in the maze through connected paths is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).

Expressed in the correct format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
