To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, one approach involves converting the adjacency list into a graph representation and applying a path-searching algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. The reason BFS is suitable here is due to its ability to explore all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it apt for unweighted graphs like this one where each edge can be treated as having the same weight or distance.

By applying BFS or an analogous systematic exploration method, one can efficiently track the path from the starting point (origin) to the destination (target), assuming such a path exists in the maze. Each node will correspond to a coordinate pair, and transitions between nodes will correspond to valid movements between connected points in the maze as defined by the adjacency list.

Given the adjacency list in the question, the graph represents connections between directly adjacent lattice points of a maze which are navigable. The start point is labeled as the origin coordinate (0,0), and the goal is to reach the end at coordinate (3,3) following the connections specified.

Considering the adjacency list:
- From (0,0) you can only reach (1,0)
- From (1,0) moves are possible to (2,0) and then to (2,1)
- From (2,1) moves are possible to (1,1) which in turn connects to (1,2)
- From (1,2) the movement can continue to (1,3) and from there to (2,3)
- From (2,3) one can go further to (3,3) which is the target
  
The connection sequence forms a viable path in the maze. Thus, systematically applying BFS would uncover this path as one of (possibly many) solutions.

Therefore, applying the reasoning above and examining the maze structure as given, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:
<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <Path_End>

This path is a direct result of exploring available routes in an orderly manner using BFS, following each possible node (maze opening) from the start to the end respecting adjacent node connections defined in the original adjacency list.
