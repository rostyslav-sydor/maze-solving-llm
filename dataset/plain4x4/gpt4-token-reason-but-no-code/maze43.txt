To solve the maze provided, we need to find a viable path from the starting point, (0,0), to the ending point, (3,3), given the adjacency list that describes which points (or cells) of the maze are directly connected to each other.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Graph Representation**:
   - The adjacency list provided indicates which cells in the maze are connected. Each pair, e.g., (2,2) <--> (3,2), indicates that one can move directly between these two cells.

2. **Graph Traversal Algorithm**:
   - To find a path from the origin to the target, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for unweighted graphs like a maze, where each edge has the same weight/cost. BFS will explore the nearest nodes first and guarantee the shortest path in such scenarios.

3. **Extracting Path from BFS**:
   - After executing BFS, we trace back from the target cell to the origin using the recorded parents of each node, resulting in the path taken to reach the target from the origin.

### Execution:

1. **Initial Setup and BFS Implementation**:
   - From the adjacency list, the graph structure implies the connectivity which can be represented internally in a suitable data structure such as a dictionary of lists for BFS implementation.

2. **Tracing the Path**:
   - Once BFS is executed, the path from origin to destination is derived by backtracking from the destination node to the origin while recording the nodes along this path.

3. **Specific Maze Solution**:
   - The solution involves executing the BFS and tracing the path as per the above strategy.

### Final Path:

Using the adjacency list and BFS technique, the traversal from (0,0) to (3,3) in the available paths can be found. The specific path is extracted as follows, depicted from origin to target by backtracking from the target using BFS parent links:

  `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

So, starting at (0,0), we move to cell (0,1), then in sequence to (1,1), (2,1), moving upwards through the maze reaching (2,2), then horizontally to (3,2), and finally to the target (3,3). Each of these moves corresponds to a direct connection defined in the adjacency list, ensuring we use only valid passages as described. This representation conforms to the format requested and follows the logic of using BFS to determine paths in a maze.
