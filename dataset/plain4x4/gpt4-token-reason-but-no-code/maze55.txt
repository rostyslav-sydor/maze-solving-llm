To find the solution path for the described maze given by the adjacency list, we must first understand the provided graph; it is a representation of how different points (represented by coordinates) in the maze are connected. By analyzing the adjacency list, we can figure out how these connections allow travel between different locations in the maze.

From the provided adjacency list and given origin and target:

- Origin (entry) coordinate: (0,0)
- Target (exit) coordinate: (3,3)

The adjacency list connections allow us to understand which paths can be taken from any given coordinate. We must trace these connections to navigate from the origin to the target efficiently.

Analyzing the list:
1. Start at the origin (0,0), and see that (0,0) connects to (0,1).
2. (0,1) connects to both (0,0) and (0,2), but since (0,0) is the starting point, we move to (0,2).
3. (0,2) connects to (0,1) and (0,3). We continue to (0,3).
4. (0,3) connects to (1,3) (also to (0,2), but it leads back).
5. From (1,3), the possible move is to (2,3) or back to (0,3). We choose (2,3).
6. (2,3) has connections to (3,3) among others. (3,3) is the target.

Each move keeps progressing closer to (3,3), avoiding cycles and backtracking to already visited nodes if possible.

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) traversing through connections is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents a direct route from the entrance to the exit of the maze by following connected nodes presented in the adjacency list, ensuring each move is towards unvisited nodes and eventually reaches the target coordinate (3,3).
