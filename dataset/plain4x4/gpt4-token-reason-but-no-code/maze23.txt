To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. The maze can be envisioned as a graph where each coordinate pair is a node and the connections detailed in the adjacency list determine the edges between these nodes. 

The adjacency list needs to be read and understood in terms of connectivity:
1. (2,1) is connected to (1,1) and (3,1).
2. (1,1) is connected to (1,0) and loops back to (2,1).
3. (0,2) is connected to (1,2), (0,3), and (0,1).
4. (1,2) is connected to multiple points: (0,2), (1,3), and (2,2).
5. (3,0) connects to both (3,1) and (2,0).
6. Additional connections exist forming a network which allows multiple potentials for routing from start to target.

Considering the maze starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,3), we are to find a viable route that navigates through the connections without looping indefinitely. A depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) could typically be used to explore paths efficiently in a systematic way that ensures all possible paths are considered. For this verbal solution, the aim is to follow one such logical path derived from the connections.

The trace for the solution, stepping through attempted and logical paths, may unfold as follows (though theoretically multiple correct solutions might exist, depending upon pathways chosen):

1. Start at (0,0), connected to (1,0).
2. From (1,0) move to (1,1), given the adjacency to (0,0) and (2,1).
3. From (1,1), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1) explore to (3,1), continuing the trend of progressing row-wise.
5. From (3,1) connect to (3,2).
6. Progress from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the target.

This path suggests a valid route from the origin to the target navigating through accessible paths based on the adjacency connections provided in the maze.

The output would be represented as:
  
    <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents one valid solution route through the maze from the entry point to the exit point as per the connectivity detailed in the adjacency list.
