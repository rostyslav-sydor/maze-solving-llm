The adjacency list provided describes a grid-like graph representing a maze, with nodes indicating positions in the maze and the connections between them specifying which positions are directly accessible from each other. The starting point of the maze is (0,0) and the target endpoint is (3,3).

To solve this maze, we need to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,3) using the connections enumerated in the list. Such a path can be discovered using standard graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly useful here because it can find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which seems to be the case for this maze.

Starting from the origin:

1. From (0,0), we can move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), we can move to (3,0).
4. From (3,0), we can move to (3,1).
5. From (3,1), we continue to (3,2).
6. Finally, from (3,2), we move to (3,3), reaching our destination.

Confirming each of these steps, we see from the adjacency list:
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

These direct movements use available paths in the adjacency list, constructing a valid route without backtracking, indicating a simple direct route exists in this specific instance of the maze.

Thus, the solution for this maze, as per the adjacency list and the origin to destination given, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
