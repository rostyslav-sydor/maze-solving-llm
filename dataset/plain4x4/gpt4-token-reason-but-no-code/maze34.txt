To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, I'll trace a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). In the adjacency list, each pair represents a connection between two points in the maze, allowing movement between them. 

To find a path:
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Identify all direct connections from (0,0) and choose a path which brings us closer to the target (3,3).
3. Continue the process at each step, choosing connections that lead toward the target without repeating any nodes.

Based on the connections listed:
- From (0,0), the possible moves are to (1,0) and (0,1).
- Following the optimal path (minimizing distance to the target), move to (1,0) as it is vertically aligned with the target.
- From (1,0), options are (0,0), already visited, or (1,1).
- From (1,1), move to (2,1) because it leads us closer to the target column 3.
- From (2,1), connections are only to previous nodes which would backtrack; thus, reassess and move back to (1,1) and look for alternative paths.
- From (1,1), go back to (0,0), (1,0), or go (1,2), a new path.
- From (1,2), progress to (2,2) directly moving closer to the target column and row.
- From (2,2), a vertical move to (3,2) better aligns with the target's row.
- Finally, from (3,2) the connection to (3,3) follows completing the path to the target.

Resulting Path:
<Path from (0,0) through (3,3)>: Start from the origin, heading south, then east climbing rows while reaching closer to the target's column, finally from south to north reaching the target.

This path is optimal considering avoidance of node revisits while constantly progressing toward the target under available connections.

Actual Path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
