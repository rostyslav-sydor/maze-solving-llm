The provided maze is described by an adjacency list, where each pair of coordinates represents two cells that are directly connected to each other, and thus you can move between. With the provided entry (origin) point of (0,0) and the exit (target) point of (3,3), a possible solution involves tracing a path through the maze that connects these points.

Given the adjacency list structure, one can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm typology to traverse from the origin to the target. These methods efficiently explore possible paths, ensuring that any potential route is checked until the correct path is identified.

For solving the maze from the adjacency list provided, we can translate each connection into a map to understand how chambers (nodes) connect. Then applying a BFS ensures that we explore all possible shortest paths from the origin without excessively retracing steps, which is suitable for this setup due to the lack of weighted paths or other complications.

Constructing the path with a BFS approach:

1. Starting from the origin (0,0), we check reachable nodes.
2. Progressing one step at a time, we can follow through connections toward the target. For instance, from (0,0) we proceed to (0,1) then (0,2) and so on.
3. We continue until reaching the target (3,3).

By examining your provided adjacency list and continuously linking connectable nodes step-by-step while respecting the start and end points, the path is deduced as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is minimally assumed considering straightforward connections and moving in a logically advancing pattern towards the exit point while adhering to the given connections. This reasoned choice of path moves carefully in a linear and direct progression towards the target, employing minimal backtracking or lateral movement.
