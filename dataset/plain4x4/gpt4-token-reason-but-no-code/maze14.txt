To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, we first interpret the list to construct a graph representation of the maze. Each pair of coordinates in the adjacency list indicates that there is a direct path between them. We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for this graph traversal since it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one we are dealing with. 

The BFS starts at the origin point (0,0) and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It utilizes a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, and it typically checks to make sure that each node is not revisited to prevent cycles from causing infinite loops.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of the BFS steps for this specific maze:
1. Initialize the BFS with the queue containing the start node `(0,0)` and mark it as visited.
2. Enqueue all adjacent nodes of the current node and record the path taken to reach each node.
3. Dequeue a node from the queue, mark it as visited, and repeat the process with its adjacent nodes.
4. Continue this process until the target node `(3,3)` is dequeued, at which point the path recorded to this node represents the shortest path from start to target.

Given that BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph and considering the adjacency information, we can create a map of the maze using the BFS traversal described to find the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.

Following that strategy, we check adjacent nodes as indicated in the adjacency pairs, ensuring to cover all possible paths and backtrack if a certain path doesn't lead to the destination. In practice, we execute BFS to find the path and trace back from the endpoint to the start using the captured paths. 

After computing, the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`, considering the adjacency and connections given in the problem, turns out to be:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path is traced directly via BFS by checking each layer of nodes and ensuring this path connects from the start to the end point, without retracing steps unnecessarily, offering an efficient route through the maze.
