To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, let's first dissect the information provided about the maze connections:

- The maze is represented as a graph with vertices and edges where each vertex is a cell of the maze (specified by its coordinates) and each edge represents a direct path between two cells.
- Entry point (origin) of the maze is at cell (0,0).
- Exit point (target) of the maze is at cell (3,3).

From the adjacency list:
- Vertices (corresponding to cells in the maze) are connected as per the pairs described.
- The adjacency list describes connections that you can travel through the maze.

Steps to solve the maze:
1. Interpret the adjacency list to reformulate the maze structure into a tangible graph.
2. Apply a pathfinding algorithm. A common approach for such problems is using Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is suitable because it explores the nearest neighbors at the current depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph-like structure.

According to the provided adjacency list, letâ€™s translate and outline potential paths, then utilize BFS:
- Starting at (0,0), a direct path is available to (0,1) based on the adjacency list. From there, the following paths can be traced:
    - (0,1) to (1,1)
    - (1,1) to (1,2)
    - (1,2) then connects to (2,2)
    - But since (2,2) doesn't connect directly or through a single intermediary to the target (3,3), observe other branchings:
        - from (1,1) alternatively move to (2,3) via cell (1,3),
        - and then from (2,3) to (3,3).

This exploration suggests a viable solution to the maze:
- Start at (0,0), move to (0,1), continue to (1,1), from there to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3).

Thus, the final path written in the specified output format representing the series of moves in the maze from the entry to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path offers a concise and valid route considering all possible connections given in the adjacency list and only moving through accessible direct connections toward the exit. The solution uses a logical dissection of the graph paths provided by the adjacency relation and an intuitive application of the BFS pathfinding methodology.
