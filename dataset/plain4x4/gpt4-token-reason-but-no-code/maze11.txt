For solving the maze represented by an adjacency list, we must first understand that the adjacency list describes the connectivity of the maze: which points (cells in the maze) are directly connected to each other. From this representation, we can form a graph where each node represents a position in the maze (specified by coordinates), and edges between nodes indicate that one can travel directly between those two positions without any obstructions.

The goal when solving the maze is finding a path from the origin to the target, starting at the point labeled (0,0) and ending at point (3,3) as indicated in the problem statement.

Here is a step-by-step method to find a path, based on the given maze's description:
 
1. **Graph Interpretation**: Convert the adjacency list into a usable form of graph data structure, typically an adjacency list or matrix for easy traversal.

2. **Traversal Strategy**: Use a graph traversal technique such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Both are suitable for finding a path in a maze. BFS is generally preferred for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is our case.

3. **Trace a Path**: Once we use BFS starting from (0,0), we mark each visited node and keep track of where we came from. This “parent” tracking allows us to reconstruct the path once we reach (3,3).

4. **Construct Path**: After reaching the target, trace back from the target node to the origin using the stored parents, creating a list of coordinates representing the path through the maze.

Let’s apply this reasoning to calculate the specific solution for the maze:

Starting from (0,0):
- Use BFS or DFS and discover nodes layer by layer.
- First, we find the neighbors of (0,0), which according to your adjacency list is directly connected to (1,0).
- From (1,0), continue to trace the path to its connected nodes until you make it to (3,3).

Analyzing the adjacency list and iterating through the connections while marking visited nodes, we can derive the following path:

Starting at (0,0), connected to (1,0). From (1,0), choose move to adjacent node (0,0) or (1,1). Persist the path toward (1,1). From (1,1), go to (1,2) and then to (1,3). You then move from (1,3) to (0,3) and (0,2) if needed, tracing back to (1,3) and eventually moving towards (2,3), reaching (3,3) finally. However, closer inspection reveals minimization could be better achieved by avoiding detours.

Corrected and minimized path (avoiding unnecessary loops and directly reaching the target):

**(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)**

Thus, the solution to the maze, represented as a set of coordinates in order from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3), is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path logically follows from the adjacency list by continuously moving through connected nodes, minimizing backtracking and ensuring each step moves closer to the target coordinate.
