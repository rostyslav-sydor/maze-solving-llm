To solve the given maze represented in the adjacency list, we first need to correctly understand and interpret the graph:

The nodes represent positions in the form (row, column), and the edges show direct passages between these positions. The maze starts at (0,0) and the exit is at (3,3).

Here's the graph based on the adjacency list provided:
- (0,2) connects to (0,1)
- (1,0) connects to (0,0)
- (1,2) connects to (1,1)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (2,1) connects to (1,1)
- (3,2) connects to (2,2)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1)
- (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (1,2) connects to (1,3)
- (2,0) connects to (2,1)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)

We need to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3). We can achieve this by finding a sequence of connected nodes from the start to the target. This is similar to a breadth-first search (BFS) in graph theory, where each node (position) is explored level by level until the exit point is reached.

After checking the connections systematically to progress from (0,0) to (3,3) while ensuring all moves use valid pathways from the adjacency list, we find:

1. Start from (0,0) and look for connections. It connects to (1,0).
2. Move to (1,0). From (1,0), connection to (2,0) exists.
3. Move to (2,0). From (2,0), connect to (2,1).
4. Move to (2,1), and from (2,1), connect to (1,1).
5. From (1,1) it connects to (1,2).
6. Move to (1,2), which connects to (1,3).
7. Move to (1,3). From there you can go (2,3).
8. From (2,3) go to (3,3), which is the target.

Thus, the solution to the maze from the start (0,0) to the end (3,3) is a path that includes following these positions:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path effectively navigates through the maze via connected nodes as displayed in the adjacency list and reaches the exit point in a logical step-by-step manner.
