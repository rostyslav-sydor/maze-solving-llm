To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, we start by identifying the entry point (origin) as (0,0) and the exit point (target) as (3,3). We note that points in the maze are connected in pairs, indicating permissible paths between them.

Given the adjacency list, we can graphically visualize or logically interpret the connectivity among the nodes (points). Our aim is to find a sequence of connected nodes starting from the origin (0,0) that leads directly to the target (3,3).

The approach involves finding a path through the nodes, checking each connection to determine which route takes us from our starting node to the destination without loops or dead ends. The connections in the adjacency list provide all possible moves from any given point.

Considering this setup, I will use a search technique (like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for simplicity in explanation here). It explores all paths starting from the origin breadth-wise, which ensures finding the shortest path (if one exists) from the origin to the target:

1. From the origin (0,0), the adjacency list indicates a direct connection to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), the options are to move to (1,1) or (2,0).
3. From (1,1), our choices further extend to (0,1) or to revisit (1,0) which we ignore to avoid loops, or we could also proceed to (2,1).
4. Progressing through, let's choose (0,1) from (1,1), which leads to possible movements to (0,2).
5. Now, from (0,2), we can proceed to (0,3).
6. From (0,3), we can choose to go to (1,3).
7. At (1,3), we can connect next to (2,3).
8. From (2,3), moving to (3,3) reaches our target which is the exit.

This path is efficient and considers all logical connections per the adjacency list, without backtracking or dead-end paths. Therefore, translating these steps into the required output format, we would have:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution is direct and adheres to the maze's connectivity rules as per the provided adjacency list.
