To find a solution for the given maze which is represented as an adjacency list, we can use graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). These methods are suitable because they can explore all possible paths from a start node (entry point) to a target node (exit point) effectively.

1. **Representation**: The maze is represented as an adjacency list showing connected nodes, where each node corresponds to coordinates `(x, y)` on a grid.

2. **Starting and Ending Points**: We start at `(0,0)` and need to get to `(3,3)`.

3. **Using BFS for Pathfinding**:
   - BFS is chosen for its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which suits the structure of the problem where each step from one node to its adjacent node has equal 'weight' or cost.
   - BFS explores neighbors level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the origin to the target.

4. **Construction of the BFS Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a queue and start with the origin node `(0,0)`.
   - As the algorithm visits a node, it looks at its immediate neighbors (as defined by the adjacency list), checks if they have been visited, and if not, adds them to the queue.
   - This process is repeated until the target node `(3,3)` is reached.

5. **Trace the Path**:
   - Keeping track of nodes and their parents, we can trace back from the target node to the origin node to obtain the path once the BFS completes.

Given the adjacency list provided, letâ€™s walk through the BFS algorithm:
- Start at `(0,0)`.
- Check and enqueue unvisited neighbors: `(1,0)` from `(0,0)`.
- Continue from `(1,0)` to its neighbors: enqueue `(2,0)`.
- From `(2,0)` to `(3,0)`, and then to `(3,1)`.
- Continue from `(3,1)` to expanding neighbors `(2,1)` and `(3,2)`.
- From `(3,2)` to `(3,3)`, reaching here signifies we've found the path to the exit.

Tracing back from `(3,3)` to `(0,0)`:
- `(3,3)` came from `(3,2)`
- `(3,2)` came from `(3,1)`
- `(3,1)` came from `(3,0)`
- `(3,0)` came from `(2,0)`
- `(2,0)` came from `(1,0)`
- `(1,0)` came from `(0,0)`, which is the origin.

Thus, the solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path indicates a sequence of coordinates traversed from the entry to the exit point in the maze, following the BFS traversal methodology noted earlier.
