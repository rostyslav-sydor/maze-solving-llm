To solve this maze, we can either use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, where each edge can be considered to have the same weight or distance.

Each node in the adjacency list represents a point in the maze, every pair shows direct adjacency (and thus directly reachable) between those points (cells). Our objective is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using these connections.

To simplify, we consider:
- **BFS** traverses level by level, ensuring that when we reach our target, it's by the shortest path possible in terms of the number of edges traversed.
- We enqueue each node along with their paths that we encounter that are not yet visited.
- We maintain a visited set to prevent visiting the same node more than once and to avoid cycles.

Given the adjacency list:
- Start from (0,0) which connects to (1,0) and (0,1). 
- From (0,1) you can reach (0,2) and (0,0), but (0,0) is already visited.
- (0,2) goes to (0,3), (1,2), and back to (0,1).
  - (1,2) further connects to (2,2). 
- (0,3) goes to (1,3).
- (3,3) connects from (2,3), but we need how to reach (2,3).

We track tracing from (0,0) to every node until (3,3) is reached:

1. Starting at (0,0), visit (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From (0,1), visit (0,2).
3. From (0,2), go to (0,3) and (1,2).
4. From (1,2), reach (2,2).
5. (0,3) leads to (1,3), connecting further to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), make the jump to (3,3).

Each of these visits observes the transitions based on the adjacency in the list. By recording the path of these visits, we can determine the route to the exit.

Thus, the specific sequence of coordinates to navigate through the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This follows the shortest path premise ensured by the BFS approach, making transitions only between directly connected coordinates as specified.
