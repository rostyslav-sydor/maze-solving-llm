To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, a suitable algorithm would be a breadth-first search (BFS). This method ensures that the shortest path between the start and the end points is found, given its layer-by-layer exploration nature. BFS is particularly effective in mazes that can be represented as graphs because it can systematically explore all possible paths from the starting point, ensuring that no potential path is missed.

In our specific case:
1. The start (origin) coordinate is (0,0)
2. The end (target) coordinate is (3,3)

First, from the adjacency list provided:
- Nodes represent coordinates within the maze.
- Edges (connections between nodes) reflect the possible paths from one coordinate to another. Each node can have multiple edges, indicating all possible direct movements from that node.

To use BFS:
- Start at the origin, then explore all directly connected nodes.
- For each explored node, then explore all its connected nodes that have not been visited yet.
- Continue this process until you either find the end node or run out of nodes to explore.

Applying BFS to this graph, it would proceed as follows:
1. Start at (0,0), move to connected nodes.
2. From (0,0) you can go to (1,0) or (0,1).
3. Continue from (1,0), reaching (2,0).
4. From (2,0), you can explore (3,0) and then move to (3,1).
5. From (3,1) you proceed to (3,2).
6. Finally, reach the destination (3,3) from (3,2).

Thus, the path traced by BFS which ensures the shortest route (due to the systematic exploration of each layer of nodes) from the start to the end:

\<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) \<PATH_END>

This path moves us systematically downward along the 0th column, shifts right at the lowest level, and then proceeds upwards. Each step is chosen based on the available paths from the current node, ensuring all possible routes are considered until the shortest path to the endpoint is found.
