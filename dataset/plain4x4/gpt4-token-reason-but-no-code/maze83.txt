In the given maze representation, all nodes (coordinates) are interconnected directly or indirectly. The task is to find a path between point (0,0) and point (3,3). We are to analyze the adjacency list and determine a path between these points using the connection details.

By examining the adjacency list:

1. It is confirmed that each connection allows movement between two grid points in either direction.
2. The path must be continuous without repeating any nodes to ensure it is a simple path from start to end.
3. Connections are given as bidirectional, so any path can move in either direction listed.

Breaking down the adjacency list for path determination between (0,0) and (3,3):

Starting from the origin (0,0):
- (0,0) is directly connected to (0,1).
- (0,1) offers two further connections to (0,0) and to (0,2) and (1,1). We avoid going back to (0,0) and can move to either (0,2) or (1,1).
- Let us choose to move to (0,2).
- (0,2) connects back to (0,1) and forward to (0,3). We move to (0,3) to avoid revisiting nodes.
- From (0,3), available movements are to (1,3) and to (0,2). We opt for (1,3) to maximize row increase.
- At (1,3), we see an opportunity to move to (2,3).
- Moving from (2,3) to (3,3) completes our journey to the endpoint.

Thus, the path traversed will be:
- Start at (0,0), move to (0,1), continue to (0,2), then on to (0,3).
- Move upward to (1,3), continue further upward to (2,3), and finally to (3,3).

Therefore, the solution for the given maze in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution is reasoned based on the adjacency connections available, taking a straightforward approach to continuously move from the starting point to the destination without backtracking or repeating any nodes.
