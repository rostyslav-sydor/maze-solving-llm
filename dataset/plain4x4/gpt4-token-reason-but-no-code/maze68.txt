In this maze, represented by an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list specifies each direct, bidirectional connection between maze points. To find the path, the maze connections can be analyzed to determine a sequence of valid moves from the start to the goal.

Here's a detailed step-by-step reasoning to find the path:

1. **Start at the origin:** Start from (0,0).
2. **Explore directly connected nodes:** From (0,0), according to the adjacency list, the next possible vertices (nodes) are (0,1) and (1,0).
3. **Choose a direction and proceed conditionally:**
   - Exploring from (0,1), the next nodes are (0,0), (0,2). Choosing (0,2) since it advances further right.
   - From (0,2), the available nodes are (0,1) and (0,3). Optimally, choose (0,3) as it progresses rightwards, towards the grid's Eastern boundary.
   - Continuing from (0,3), the connected node is (1,3), pushing the path downwards toward the target.
4. **Continue the path toward the target:**
   - From (1,3), next potential nodes are (0,3) and (2,3). Since the target is located in the third row, moving to (2,3) is beneficial.
   - At (2,3), available nodes are (1,3) and (3,3). Move to (3,3) as it is the target node.
5. **Reach the target**: Arriving at (3,3) confirms the target is reached.

This path not only proceeds logically from node to node using available links but also optimizes for vertical and horizontal moves toward the final goal, minimizing unnecessary back-and-forth movements.

Given this analysis, the specific path from the maze's origin to the target in the required format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequence of moves provides a direct and efficient solution from the starting point to the endpoint, following the connections defined in the adjacency list and ensuring each move takes the path closer to the target.
