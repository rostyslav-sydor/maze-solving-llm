To solve the maze described by the adjacency list, it's important to first visualize the structure as a graph where each node corresponds to a coordinate in the maze, and each edge denotes a direct path or passage between those coordinates. For the given maze, the Entry point is (0,0) and the Exit is at (3,3).

### Breakdown and Strategy:
1. **Understanding the Graph**: The given adjacency list reconnects nodes (coordinates), depicting passable routes between them. The maze starts at node (0,0) and ends at node (3,3).

2. **Pathfinding**: A common approach to finding paths in a graph is using a Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores neighbors level-by-level out from the source, which ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. This works well for mazes structured as undirected, unweighted graphs.

3. **Plan**:
    - Convert the adjacency list to a more manageable form (e.g., dictionary of nodes and their respective connections).
    - Implement BFS to navigate from start (0,0) to the end (3,3).

### Coordinated Steps:
- Begin at (0,0), move to connected nodes.
- Explore systematically outward, ensuring each path possibility is checked.
- As (3,3) is reached, backtrack to determine the sequence of moves made.

### Specific Path:
From the adjacency list, the connections can be represented, and BFS will find the shortest path:
1. Start from (0,0), possible moves are to (1,0).
2. Then from (1,0) the next move is to (2,0).
3. From (2,0) progress to (2,1).
4. Move next to (3,1) from (2,1).
5. Then proceed to (3,0).
6. From (3,0), though an explicit connection to (3,3) isnâ€™t next, we continue to (3,1) again.
7. Then move to (3,2).
8. Finally, move from (3,2) to the exit at (3,3).

### Outputting the Solution:
The sequence of coordinates in the format specified, from start to end following the resolved path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence efficiently represents the movements across the graph from entry to exit, using all paths articulated in the adjacency list.
