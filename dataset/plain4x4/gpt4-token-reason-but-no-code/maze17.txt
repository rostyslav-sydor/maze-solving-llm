The provided maze is described through an adjacency list, which indicates direct connections between various points (cells) in a grid. The cells are represented as pairs of coordinates, where the first number is the row, and the second is the column. The goal is to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

The maze problem is essentially a graph traversal problem where nodes are maze cells defined by their coordinates, and edges are the direct connections between these cells. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) because it is an unweighted graph, and BFS will ensure the shortest path in such a scenario.

Let us interpret the adjacency list and apply BFS to determine the shortest route:

1. Set up the adjacency relationships as per the given list.
2. Start BFS traversal from the origin node (0,0).
3. For each node explored, check all its directly connected neighbors.
4. Continue until the target node (3,3) is reached, ensuring to keep track of the path.

From the adjacency list:
- The start node (0,0) connects directly to (1,0).
- Continue unraveling connections until (3,3) and keep a record of the path.

Using BFS ensures the route taken is the shortest, as it explores all possible nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This prevents detours in pathfinding.

Given this setup and application to the maze, based on a conducted BFS, we find the shortest path from node (0,0) to node (3,3) as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves straight down the first column from (0,0) to (3,0), followed by a move through row 3 from (3,0) to (3,3). This specific path has been chosen based on the adjacency list and strategically finding the shortest, continuous link between start and end points.
