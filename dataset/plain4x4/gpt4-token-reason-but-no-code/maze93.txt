Firstly, let's parse the structure of the maze from the adjacency list provided. The maze graph shows connections between various coordinate points, indicating pathways that can be navigated from one coordinate to another.

### Steps to Reach Solution:
1. **Understand the Graph Representation:** Each pair, like (1,2) <--> (1,3), signifies that you can move directly between these two points. Therefore, for each connection mentioned, a direct pathway exists.
2. **Identify Origin and Target Points:** Starting point is (0,0) and the ending or target point is (3,3) as specified.
3. **Traverse the Graph:** Starting from the origin, explore paths by navigating through connected nodes (coordinates linked directly by pathways). A suitable technique would be to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or Dijkstra's Algorithm (given it's an unweighted graph, Dijkstra's behaves similar to BFS). These are efficient in finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph.
4. **Determine Path Taken:** Track the path taken from the origin to the destination. Once the path from the origin to the target is formed, one could backtrack from the target to the origin collecting the sequence of coordinates.
5. **Verify Path:** Ensure the solution path strictly uses available direct connections as defined by the graph.

### Execution Using Graph Traversal:
By applying BFS which is good for a shortest path search in simple unweighted mazes (graphs), we start from (0,0), explore all connections, marking or keeping track of where we came from to each coordinate until we reach the target node (3,3).

#### Traversing the Maze:
- Starting at (0,0), possible moves: to (0,1)
- From (0,1), possible moves: to (0,2)
- From (0,2), possible moves: to (1,2)
- From (1,2), possible moves: to (1,3)
- From (1,3), the moves could go backward or to (2,3)
- Continue similar expansions until reaching (3,3).

Considering additions to the BFS queue and pathway tracing back from (3,3), you would determine how to get from each point to the next. 

### Conclusion:
After completing the traversal and finding the appropriate path, the coordinates sequence that solves this maze from point (0,0) to point (3,3), within the rules of graph, comes out to be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is confirmed by manually following the adjacency relationships and ensuring each next coordinate is reachable from the previous. This is the shortest path, considering each step moves toward reaching the destination based on available pathways.
