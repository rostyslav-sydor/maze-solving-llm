To solve the given maze, we first need to understand how it is structured based on the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list tells us which cells (nodes) are connected to each other directly (edges). 

Starting from the origin (0,0) and needing to reach the target (3,3), our goal is to determine a path through connected nodes such that each step moves from one node to an adjacent one.

Steps to solve the maze:
1. **Graph Representation:** First, we understand that the grid layout likely represents a series of pathways where each adjacency pair indicates navigable directions. For example, (3,1) <--> (3,0) means one can move from (3,1) to (3,0) and vice versa.
  
2. **Trace Connectivity:** Using the provided edges, we identify possible paths from the start to the end point. We check connections step-by-step:
    - From (0,0) we can only go to (0,1) due to connection (0,0) <--> (0,1).
    - Next from (0,1), the related connection is (0,1) <--> (1,1).
    - From (1,1), based on the adjacency list, one can continue to (1,1) <--> (2,1).
    - From (2,1), proceeding to (2,1) <--> (2,2).
    - From (2,2), one can move to (2,2) <--> (2,3) or (2,2) <--> (1,2) and then (1,2) <--> (1,3).
    - Following the chain from (2,3) leads to (2,3) <--> (3,3).
   
3. **Path Optimization:** While simple depth or breadth-first search could solve the maze by exploring all possible paths, under this scenario we are tracing a path between specifically connected points listed in the adjacency list, ensuring our moves are valid.

Using this method, we map a valid path from the starting point (0,0) to the endpoint (3,3), as follows:

- Begin at (0,0), go to (0,1)
- Move to (1,1) from (0,1)
- Continue on to (2,1) from (1,1)
- Proceed to (2,2) from (2,1)
- Then move to (2,3) from (2,2)
- Finally reach (3,3) from (2,3)

By following each connection logically, the specific solution for navigating the given maze is mapped as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path efficiently allows movement from the origin to the target following connected paths and respecting the adjacency constraints given.
