To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, the task requires finding a path from the designated starting point, (0,0), to the given target, (3,3).

### Reasoning and Steps:

1. **Representation:** The maze is given as pairs of directly connected points (edges in graph terminology):
    - For example, (1,2) <--> (1,3) means you can move from (1,2) directly to (1,3) and vice versa.
    - Thus, it constructs a graph where each coordinate pair is a vertex, and each connection between them is an edge.

2. **Finding a Path:** The solution involves finding a path through this graph from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using these connections.
    - A search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) is typically used for such tasks. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

3. **Traversing the Graph:**
    - Starting from (0,0), you explore all reachable vertices by following the edges.
    - You proceed to check adjacent nodes, marking them visited and tracking the path until the target (3,3) is reached.

### Solution Path:
Given the connections, we explore possible routes from (0,0), expanding our search systematically:

- Start from **(0,0)**, move to **(0,1)** (as per (0,0) <--> (0,1)).
- From **(0,1)**, you can go to **(1,1)** (as per (0,1) <--> (1,1)).
- From **(1,1)**, move to **(2,1)** ((2,1) <--> (1,1)).
- From **(2,1)**, proceed to **(2,2)** ((2,1) <--> (2,2)).
- Then, from **(2,2)**, move to **(2,3)** ((2,2) <--> (2,3)).
- From **(2,3)**, you can finally reach **(3,3)** ((2,3) <--> (3,3)).

This route consistently follows available edges in the adjacency list and ensures that each move is to an adjacent and connected coordinate.

### Conclusion:
The solution path from the start (0,0) to the target (3,3) utilizing the adjacency connections and ensuring valid transitions between connected nodes is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is both valid as per the given connections and efficient in terms of demonstrating an explicit route through the maze.
