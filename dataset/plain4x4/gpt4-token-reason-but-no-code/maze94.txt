To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). We interpret the adjacency list to identify all the direct connections between coordinates, which represent paths that can be taken to traverse from one coordinate to another.

### Understanding the Maze

From the given adjacency list, the connections are as follows:
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)

### Reasoning for the Path

From the origin (0,0) our goal is to navigate through the graph, using the links, to reach the target (3,3). A pathfinding algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) can typically be employed to solve such problems. 

1. **Starting Point**: Begin at the initial node (0,0).
2. **Connections**: Look at the connections from the current node and traverse in a systematic way to reach the exit point:
    - From (0,0) we can go to (1,0) (via adjacency between (1,0) <--> (0,0)).
    - From (1,0) proceed to (2,0) (via adjacency between (2,0) <--> (1,0)).
    - From (2,0) move to (3,0) (via adjacency between (3,0) <--> (2,0)).
    - From (3,0) we have an adjaceny to (3,1) and then to (3,2).
    - From (3,2), finally navigate to (3,3) (via adjacency between (3,2) <--> (3,3)), which is our target.

This route is chosen for its simplicity and directness, minimizing backtracking and ensuring a forward movement towards the target row '3'.

### Path Output

Following the derived solution, the full path in the required format would be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path utilizes the established connections in the adjacency list, providing a logical move from the entry point to the exit point of the maze.
