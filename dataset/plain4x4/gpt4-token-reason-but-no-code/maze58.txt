To solve the maze, we will start by translating the adjacency list into a more visual form, such as a graph or a grid. The adjacency list tells us how cells in the maze are connected. We need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

From the adjacency list, we can observe:
- Each pair like `(a, b) <--> (c, d)` shows that the cells `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are directly connected and one can move between them.

The entry (or start) point is `(0,0)` and the exit (or target) point is `(3,3)`. Letâ€™s use a path-finding algorithm, where a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach is more common for such problems. BFS would be ideal because it explores all possible locations at the present depth prior to moving on to paths longer in length, thus finding the shortest path. Let's manually apply BFS.

Looking at connections:
1. From `(0,0)`, the next possible step (based on list) is `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, the options are `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`.
3. From `(1,1)`, the options expand to `(2,1)`, `(1,0)`, and back to `(0,1)`.
4. We proceed similarly, mapping out reachable nodes while keeping track of previously visited nodes to avoid cycles.

Expanding outwards from `(0,0)` going sequentially by levels (layers of our BFS), avoiding already visited nodes:
- Start at `(0,0)`, go to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, go next to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, go to `(2,1)`.
- From `(2,1)`, no new nodes are available, return to `(1,1)` and explore `(1,0)`.
- From `(1,0)`, go to `(2,0)`.
- From `(2,0)`, go to `(3,0)`.
- From `(3,0)`, move to `(3,1)`.
- From `(3,1)`, go to `(3,2)`.
- From `(3,2)`, move to `(3,3)`, which is our target.

Thus, the path followed is:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This sequence shows a possible path from the entrance to the exit in the given maze, capturing the essence of moving through each coordinate step by step as allowable by adjacency. Here, we find a literal connection path ensuring connectivity and moving from the origin to the destination using a path finding approach in the maze structure provided.
