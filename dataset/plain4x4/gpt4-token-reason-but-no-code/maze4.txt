To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, the objective is to find a path from the origin coordinate `(0,0)` to the target coordinate `(3,3)`. This involves traversing through connected nodes as specified in the adjacency list.

### Analyzing the Adjacency List:

1. **Break down the adjacency list** to identify the connections between different points (nodes) and note these in a graph-like structure where there are edges connecting every specified pair.

2. **Define entry and exit points** which are given as `(0,0)` and `(3,3)` respectively.

3. **Use a pathfinding algorithm** such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) that systematically explores neighbor nodes level by level until the target node is found. This method will ensure finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.

### Pathfinding:
Using BFS, starting from `(0,0)`, we systematically explore each neighboring node as dictated by the adjacency list until reaching `(3,3)`. By storing the path taken to reach each node, we can trace back from the target node to the origin node once we reach it.

Here's the possible traversal explained:

- Start at `(0,0)`, connections are to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
- From `(0,1)`, continue to `(0,2)`.
- From `(0,2)`, continue to `(1,2)`.
- From `(1,2)`, there are connections to `(1,1)` and can continue to `(2,3)` through `(1,3)`.
- From `(1,3)`, progress to `(2,3)`, and from there move to `(3,3)`.

This forms a viable, connected path that reaches the target.

### Solution:
Thus, a valid route leading from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` using this structured approach is as follows:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This solution offers a direct compliant path to the maze following the given adjacency connections, ensuring traversal from origin to target as instructed.
