To solve this maze, we'll first interpret the adjacency list given to understand how the maze is structured. Then, we will determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), using a basic graph traversal algorithm like breadth-first search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Understanding the Maze Structure
From the adjacency list provided:
- (1,3) is connected to (2,3), (1,2), and (0,3).
- (2,1) is connected to (1,1) and (3,1).
- (3,2) is connected to (3,1) and (2,2).
- (2,2) is connected to (1,2) and (3,2).
- Several other direct connections are outlined similarly in the list.

The maze can thus be visualized as a grid with certain cells connected directly to each other as specified.

### Using Breadth-First Search for the Shortest Path
Breadth-first search works by exploring all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to explore:
1. Enqueue the starting node (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Continuously dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and:
   - Check if it is the destination node. If so, terminate the search.
   - Otherwise, for each of its adjacently connected nodes, if not already visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them.
3. To reconstruct the path once reaching the destination, we can maintain a predecessor for each node.

### Traversing the Given Maze
1. Initiate BFS from (0,0).
2. Check all possible connections as described in the list. The BFS will systematically explore all reachable nodes from (0,0) and store the predecessor for each:
   - From (0,0) to (0,1)
   - Then exploring from each, we connect to further points until eventually covering all points and checking for (3,3).
3. By tracing back from (3,3) to (0,0) using the predecessor pointers stored during BFS, we generate the shortest path.

### Shortest Path Solution
For this maze, after computing and backtracking using BFS, we find the path taken, considering all the connectivity and avoiding unconnected direct paths:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the available connections logically, ensuring each move is valid through the given adjacency list, leading to the shortest path from the origin to the target within the maze.
