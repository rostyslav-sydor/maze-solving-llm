To solve this maze, we will consider the given maze graph to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3). The maze is expressed as an adjacency list, and we will traverse through this graph finding possible paths using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is effective in exploring the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this one.

Considering the adjacency relationships provided:
1. From the entry point (0,0), we can move to (0,1), and from (0,1) we can either go back to (0,0) or onward to (0,2).
2. With each movement option, we explore further extending connections until reaching the desired point (3,3) or exhaust all paths.

Here's how the BFS will work given the adjacency relationships:
- Start at (0,0)
- Explore all neighbor nodes before going into nodes that are two steps away
- Keep track of each node visited to avoid revisits and looping
- Stop when reaching the destination node (3,3)

Given the maze structure:
- From (0,0) go to (0,1)
- From (0,1) go to (0,2)
- From (0,2) we explore options and find that a move to (1,2) is possible
- From (1,2) it's possible to proceed to (1,1) as well as (1,3)
- Moving from (1,2) to (1,3) we find that (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- From (2,3) we can go to (3,3), our target

All steps ensuring no revisits and using every connection effectively brings us to (3,3).

The path to go from (0,0) to (3,3) would then look like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By sticking to connected nodes and expanding only along viable paths that lead us closer to (3,3), BFS ensures that we find the optimal route swiftly without redundantly scanning less promising paths. This reasoning concludes the solution path as presented.
