To solve the maze given in the adjacency list, we first need to parse the structure into a more usable format like a graph and then apply a pathfinding algorithm. The adjacency list tells us how different nodes (positions in the maze) are connected, which essentially forms a graph's edges. The origin and target are clearly indicated as (0,0) and (3,3) respectively.

Upon examining the structure:

1. **Graph Parsing**: The adjacency list indicates which nodes are connected directly. We must use these connections to navigate through the maze.

2. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Using algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth First Search) is suitable here as these algorithms are good for unweighted graphs like this one, where each edge has the same weight or cost.

3. **BFS Approach**: Breadth-First Search is generally preferable for such mazes to find the shortest path. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's optimal in uniform cost situations due to its nature of exploring equally from the source.

### Explanation of BFS In Maze Context:

- Start at the origin `(0,0)`.
- Explore all directly connected nodes (expand breadthwise).
- Keep track of visited nodes to prevent revisiting and looping indefinitely.
- Continue until the target `(3,3)` is reached.
- Render the path by retracing steps using a predecessor list or similar mechanism maintained during search.

### Application to the Given Graph:

Given the connections from the adjacency list, and starting at `(0,0)` (as denoted by `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>` tokens):

1. From `(0,0)`, possible moves are to `(0,1)`, and `(1,0)`.
2. Expanding from these:
   - From `(1,0)`, you can go to `(2,0)`.
   - From `(0,1)`, only `(0,0)` can be revisited, which is redundant.
3. Continue this process:
   - From `(2,0)` to `(3,0)` to `(3,1)` to `(3,2)` and then `(3,3)`. 

On doing this expansion through BFS, ensuring each step is only made to an adjacent square that has not been visited before, the answers become clear and lead to the path to exit the maze.

### Conclusion:

By examining all possible moves from each point considering non-revisit to any node, the move sequence from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` using the connections provided can be calculated and visualized step by step. Hence, complying with the adjacency list connections and BFS, the solution (shortest path in this context) is formed.

### Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This specific sequence is the shortest path possible with the given conditions and the described methodology.
