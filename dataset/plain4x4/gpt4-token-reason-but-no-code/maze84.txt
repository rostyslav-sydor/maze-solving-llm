The adjacency list provided describes a maze where each node represents a position in a grid, and the edges represent direct paths between adjacent positions. The task is to find a path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3).

To solve this maze, you can employ a breadth-first search (BFS), which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS starts from the starting vertex, explores all its adjacent nodes, then for each of those, it explores their adjacent nodes which are not visited yet, and continues this pattern until the destination node is reached or all possible paths are explored.

Using BFS for this maze:

1. Start at the entry point (0,0).
2. Move to available adjacent nodes, which according to the adjacency list is (1,0).
3. From (1,0), the next nodes are (0,0) which has been visited, and (2,0), so we go to (2,0).
4. Continue from (2,0) to reach (2,1).
5. From (2,1) we move to (3,1).
6. Progress from (3,1) to (3,2).
7. Finally, from (3,2) advance to reach the exit point at (3,3).

Now, putting this path into the required output format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves represents one of the valid shortest paths through the maze from the given origin to the target using the connections described in the adjacency list. Each step has been confirmed to connect sequentially from the list provided, ensuring the path is correct.
