To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, I analyzed the given connections between coordinates. The goal was to identify a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by following the connected nodes listed in the adjacency list.

I started by listing all paths that connect directly from each point, enabling an understanding of possible movements within the maze from any given position. For example, the node (0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0), suggesting initial possible paths to start moving through the maze from the origin.

Considering the defined adjacency connections, I traced paths node by node, keeping continuity and avoiding cycles, where a cycle would mean revisiting the same node without reaching the target, which is suboptimal for solving the maze.

From the origin (0,0) and moving to (1,0) and then to (2,0), I looked for paths that continually moved towards the target. The adjacency of (2,0) to (3,0), and then from (3,0) to (3,1), and so on, helped in determining this chain of movements.

Further following the connections:
- From (3,1) to (3,2) and finally (3,2) to (3,3), this path continually moved right and down, which aligns with the target location in relation to the starting point.

With these connections defined, I ensured that each step in the path was valid based on the adjacency list, and that the path actually led to the target. By repeatedly confirming node-to-node connections through the list, the solution path is constructed such that it moves efficiently from the start to the end without unnecessary detours.

Considering all these steps and verifying with the adjacency list, the final path found that navigates through the maze from (0,0) to (3,3) with the allowed movements is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents a logical movement through the maze connecting all the critical nodes from the start to the end as per the adjacency list's allowed connections.
