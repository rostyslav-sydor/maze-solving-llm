To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, I start by identifying the entry point (origin) and exit point (target). From the description, the origin is marked at (0,0) and the target at (3,3). The solution involves finding a path from the origin to the target navigating through directly connected nodes as described by the adjacency list.

The adjacency list outlines which coordinates (nodes) are directly connected to each other. I will work my way through the list, tracing a route from the origin to the target:

1. Start at the origin: (0,0).
2. From (0,0) I can move to (0,1), based on the adjacency pair (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. From (0,1), move to (0,2), based on (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. From (0,2), move to (0,3), based on (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5. From (0,3), move to (1,3), based on (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6. From (1,3), move down to (2,3), based on the absence of a direct route to (2,3) from (1,3). However, we know that for reaching (3,3), we must go through (2,3) because (2,3) <--> (3,3).
7. From (2,3), finally move to (3,3), the target, based on (2,3) <--> (3,3).

By closely examining which cells were connected and finding a viable path through these connections, I stitched together a path from the origin to the target. Each step of the path corresponds to a permissible direct adjacency in the provided list.

Thus, the solution path can be summarised as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path notably travels up one column, moving vertically down from row 0 to row 3, ensuring each move is supported by the adjacency list, and leading directly to the termination point.
