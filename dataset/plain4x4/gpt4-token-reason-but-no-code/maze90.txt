To solve the maze, I will first interpret the given adjacency list as a directional graph representation. Here, each pair of coordinates represents a direct connection between two points or nodes in the maze. The goal is to find a path from the origin point, designated as (0,0), to the target point, designated as (3,3).

I will explore the graph using a simple breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, commonly used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. BFS will navigate the maze layer by layer, which ensures that once we reach the destination point, the path found is amongst the shortest.

From the description:
- **Start Point (Origin)**: (0,0)
- **End Point (Target)**: (3,3)
- **Graph Adjacency List**: Pairs of directly connected points.

Following the BFS approach involves:
1. Starting from the origin, checking each of its directly connected neighbors.
2. For each neighbor, checking its own neighbors and so on, but ensuring not to revisit any point, unless it is beneficial (i.e., it provides a shorter route to a point). A queue data structure is used to manage the nodes as they are explored.
3. Using a way to trace back the path once the target point is reached.

Traversing via BFS using the provided connections:
- Start from (0,0). Neighbors: (0,1) and (1,0).
- From (0,1), the next possible moves are to (0,2). From (1,0), the next possible move is to (1,1).
- Continue expanding: From (0,2) to (0,3), from (1,1) either to (2,1) or back to (1,2) or (1,0).
- __(1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3)__, appears all directly connected based on given adjacency.

The route checking identified the path as following from the start point (0,0) to the target point (3,3):
- Move to (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3).

Formatting the output as specifically requested:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates via direct links between nodes in the order found using the BFS approach, ensuring that it is one of the simplest and shortest paths due to the nature of BFS, exploring each node layer by layer until the target is reached.
