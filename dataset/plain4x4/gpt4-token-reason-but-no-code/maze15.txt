Starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming for the target (3,3), the challenge is to traverse the maze using the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list reveals valid movements between coordinates, which represents the maze connections.

To solve this, I'll break down the adjacency list to understand direct connections and find a path from the origin to the target. Each adjacent node connection allows a step-by-step move through the maze. The goal is to utilize these connections coherently toward the destination.

Using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), one can systematically explore all feasible paths from (0,0) to (3,3) looking for a valid route. Here, I’ll map out a BFS for clarity and to ensure the shortest path is found efficiently:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Explore reachable neighbors.
3. Move to (0,1) based on adjacency with (0,0).
4. Move next to (0,2), following adjacency with (0,1).
5. From (0,2), move to (0,3) — again following the adjacency rule.
6. From (0,3), transition to (1,3).
7. (1,3) can connect to (2,3), hence we move there.
8. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3), which is the target.

Checking these steps, each transition complies with the adjacency rules listed in the input, suggesting this path should be valid.

By visualizing the adjacency list as a graph in my mind or on paper, tracing the connections and using BFS ensures not only finding a path but ensuring it's amongst the shortest. 

Now translating this solution into the specified format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path logically flows from node to node maintaining the right adjacency and connectivity, appropriately addressing the maze routing problem.
