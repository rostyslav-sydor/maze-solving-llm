The goal of the maze is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). To solve this, I'll utilize the adjacency list representation to understand how each vertex (i.e., coordinate) is connected and then trace a route from the start to the end leveraging the available connections.

Starting at the origin:
1. From `(0,0)` - directly connected to `(1,0)`.
2. From `(1,0)` - move to `(1,1)` which is connected.
3. From `(1,1)` - transition next to `(1,2)`, another connected vertex.
4. From `(1,2)` - proceed to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)` - move up to `(0,3)` per the adjacency connections listed.
6. From `(0,3)` - continue to `(0,2)`.
7. From `(0,2)` - head back a bit to reconnect to `(1,2)` (though optional since already traversed, this path confirms full connectivity).
8. From `(1,2)` - it connects to `(2,2)`.
9. From `(2,2)` - proceed to `(2,3)`.
10. From `(2,3)` - transition finally to `(3,3)`.

This path ensures we have navigated through accessible connections between maze passages per the adjacency list provided, ensuring reach from origin to target.

Consequently, based on the discussed steps and route analysis, the solution to reach from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` in the maze can be described as:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path has made use of all potential segments provided in the adjacency list effectively, maintaining a logical progression toward the designated target location.
