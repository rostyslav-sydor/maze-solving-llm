To solve the given maze described through an adjacency list of nodes, we begin by clearly understanding the maze structure. The nodes represent coordinates in a 2D array, and the edges connecting the nodes signify that one can move directly between these coordinates.

The adjacency list provided essentially informs us of the possible movements in the maze from one coordinate to another. To find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we can use a graph traversal technique, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**Reasoning:**
1. We translate the adjacency list into a more structured form (typically a dictionary) where each key is a coordinate and the corresponding value is a list of directly connected coordinates.
2. Starting from the origin coordinate `(0,0)`, BFS will exploit all reachable coordinates layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found as soon as we reach the destination coordinate `(3,3)`.
3. During BFS, for each node (coordinate), we will explore its neighboring nodes as provided by the adjacency list. We keep track of visited nodes to prevent revisiting and looping.
4. We will also maintain a predecessor map to reconstruct the path once we reach the target node. When the target is reached, we trace back using this map from the target to the source to generate the path.
5. The coordinates that BFS reaches in each step will form a potential path from origin to destination.
6. The edge list provided makes all these connections evident, and there is clear connectivity between the origin and target.

**Structured Solution:**
- Start BFS at `(0,0)`, move to connected nodes `(1,0)` then `(2,0)`.
- From `(2,0)` move to `(3,0)`, and subsequently move up vertically from `(3,0)` to `(3,1)` and `(3,2)`.
- The final move from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)` completes the path.
- Thus, the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` exploits available connections in a straightforward BFS manner, navigating through the permissible moves until it reaches the destination.

**Specific Solution for the Maze:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path provides a continuous and permissible route from the start to the finish of the maze, utilizing the adjacency relations given, and ensuring each step is legally connected to the next as dictated by the adjacency list.
