To solve the maze provided, we start by representing the adjacency list of the graph in a manner that each node (coordinate) and its connections (edges to other coordinates) are clear. We also identify the starting point (origin) as (0,0) and the target endpoint as (3,3).

From the adjacency list provided:
- (3,2) connects to (3,1) and (3,3)
- (3,1) connects to (2,1) and (3,0)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (1,1)
- (3,3) connects to (3,2)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0) and (0,1)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (2,2) connects to (2,3) and (2,1)
- (1,2) connects to (1,3) and (0,2)
- (0,2) connects to (1,2)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3) and (2,3)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (2,2)
- (2,1) connects to (2,2) and (3,1)

Using this information, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm would systematically explore all paths from the origin until it finds the shortest path to the target. BFS is suitable for unweighted graphs like this because it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Starting at (0,0), we follow through the path iteratively:

1. From (0,0), go to (0,1) (as it's a direct connect and the only path forward).
2. From (0,1), go to (1,1) (again, a direct connection).
3. From (1,1), move forward to (2,1) through connections available.
4. From (2,1), move to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), move to (2,3).
6. Lastly, from (2,3) move to (3,3) which is the target destination.

Thus, putting this sequence in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures a correct shortest path from start to the end in the maze as described, using BFS algorithmically through the adjacency list mapping.
