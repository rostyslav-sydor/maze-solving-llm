To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, I would start by identifying the connections from the origin to the target and work through a systematic approach such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). These strategies are effective because they allow us to explore all possible paths from the origin to the destination, systematically tracking visited nodes or positions and ensuring we don't revisit or loop indefinitely.

Given the starting point (origin) is at (0,0) and the destination (target) is at (3,3), I will apply a BFS as this typically finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs or mazes.

The BFS will be carried by:
1. **Initialization**: Starting at (0,0), with this as the initial node in my queue.
2. **Exploration**: From each node, I will explore adjacent nodes â€” moving either up, down, left, or right, as permitted by the maze's connections.
3. **Queue**: Each newly discovered node will be added to a queue and marked as visited.
4. **Track Path**: For each node, I maintain a record of its predecessor to rebuild the path once the target is reached.

Based on the connections:
```plaintext
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (0,1)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
```

Applying BFS from the origin (0,0):

- From (0,0), we can move to (0,1).
- From (0,1), we can move to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can move to (1,2).
- From (1,2), we can then move to (2,2).
- From (2,2), continue to (2,3).
- From (2,3), proceed to (1,3).
- From (1,3), reach to (0,3).
- Continue from (0,3) to (1,3) - seems redundant, back to (1,3).
- Alternatively, from (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3).

So, we chain these together to form the path from the origin to the target. Note that multiple valid paths may exist depending on the exploration order and specific graph structure.

Given a path deduction via BFS:
- Starting from (0,0) and progressing as explored to arrive eventually at (3,3) via adjacent points.

Thus, the solution to the maze would be noted as:
**<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>**

This path has selected a route based on available connections and BFS strategy ensuring a viable and potentially one of the shortest paths through the maze from the specified start to end points.
