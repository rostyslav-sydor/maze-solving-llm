To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)`. The adjacency list defines the connections between nodes (coordinates in the maze):

- By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the links between each coordinate and see which coordinates are directly accessible from any given coordinate.
- We'll employ a simple pathfinding approach like a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore possible paths from the entry to the exit.
- Both DFS and BFS are effective for this type of graph traversal. BFS is generally preferred in maze solving as it will find the shortest path when unweighted, like in this case where all moves have equal cost.

Starting at `(0,0)`, using the adjacency list, and employing BFS:

1. From `(0,0)`, the neighboring nodes are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. Exploring from `(0,1)`, we can go to `(1,1)` or `(0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, move to `(0,3)` or backtrack to `(0,1)`.
4. Exploring deeper:
   - `(0,3)` to nowhere else directly useful.
   - `(1,1)` can link to `(2,1)` which connects further to other nodes.
5. Proceeding:
   - `(2,1)` connects to `(2,2)` and `(1,1)`; from `(2,2)`, move to `(3,2)`.
   - `(3,2)` goes to `(3,3)` or back to `(3,1)`.
6. From `(3,2)`, moving to `(3,3)` reaches the exit.

Thus, the path can be traced back with the coordinates visited from the start to the exit.

The resulting path with BFS (not necessarily the only solution, but one efficient solution) from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is derived by exploring adjacent nodes and choosing the ones that get progressively closer to the target, while also making sure to cover all possible paths efficiently until the destination is reached. This path utilizes the adjacency relationships defined and navigates through the nodes incrementally, ensuring each step is towards an area not yet visited or towards the exit.
