To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, I will employ a common pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth First Search (BFS). This algorithm is suitable as it can efficiently find the shortest path from a starting node (in this case the maze's entry point) to a target node (the maze's exit).

### Reasoning:

1. **Parsing the Adjacency List:**
   - The list provides direct connections between accessible coordinates. It is essential to convert these into a usable structure mapping each coordinate to its neighbors.

2. **Selecting the Algorithm - BFS:**
   - BFS is chosen because it explores the nearest nodes first and gradually goes deeper, ensuring that once it reaches the target, it's through the shortest possible path. In the context of the maze, this means finding the quickest way out, passing through interconnected coordinates.

3. **Implementation:**
   - **Initialize** a queue that begins with the starting position (0,0) and a set of visited nodes to prevent revisiting and looping.
   - **Explore** the neighborhood of each node. For every node, check every possible move (using the adjacency relationships or connections) and push each non-visited neighbor into the queue.
   - **Track** the path by maintaining a previous node map that records where each node was accessed from. This can be used to reconstruct the path once the target (3,3) is reached.
   - **Complete** when the target is reached or all possible paths are explored (queue empties). By tracing back from the target node to the starting node using the previous node map, the path can be reconstructed.

### Application on Current Maze:

Given the maze information:
- Start at (0,0)
- End at (3,3)

By applying BFS:
- Start at (0,0). Neighbors: (0,1).
- Go to (0,1). Neighbors: (0,2).
  - Continue this neighborhood exploration...
- Successively move through (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), and finally (3,3).

#### Constructing the Step-by-Step Path Solution:
- Starting at (0,0), move down and right through the coordinates in sequence based on accessible paths found by BFS.
- The ordered path leading from (0,0) to (3,3) given the adjacency relationships and using BFS would be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

### Output the Path:
Hence, translating the above walkthrough solution into the coordinate list format requested:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This output represents the shortest path through the maze from the specified entry to the exit point as discovered by the Breadth First Search algorithm.
