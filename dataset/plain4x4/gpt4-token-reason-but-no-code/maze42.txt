To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list of tokens, the aim is to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). The list presents the possible moves from each coordinate to its directly connected neighbors.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Understanding the List**: Each pair in the adjacency list shows direct connections, e.g., (2,3) <--> (3,3) means from coordinate (2,3) one can move to (3,3) and vice versa.

2. **Setting the Origin and Target**: The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).

3. **Planning the Path**: From the origin (0,0), we investigate reachable points, aiming towards the target. We should choose paths that progressively move towards the target (in this case, towards increasing x and y coordinates when beneficial).

4. **Exploring Options**: Lay out all possible paths using the adjacency list and focusing on those moves that collectively head towards the target.

### Chosen Path:
- Starting at (0,0), we have to decide between possible connected points (if any). From the list, direct moves are possible to (0,1).
- From (0,1), move next to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move to (0,3).
- From (0,3), move to (1,3).
- From (1,3), move to (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is the target.

This series of moves was chosen because at each step, there's a progression either towards right or upwards in favor of reaching the target. The movements are simple as they aim towards minimizing backtracking and ensure a direct route towards increasing both row and column values as much as the connections allow.

### Conclusion:
Given the connections listed in the adjacency format, and based on the direct transitions allowed, the optimal path that emerges from the choices available is the direct path along the x or y coordinates, directly pointing towards our target without detours.

### Specific Solution:
The path computed here leads directly towards the target, effectively navigating through the connected maze coordinates while ensuring the x or y values are always moving towards reaching (3,3).

Thus, the explicit solution in the required format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path is direct and efficient based on the provided adjacency list, providing a clear route from the origin to the destination without unnecessary detours.
