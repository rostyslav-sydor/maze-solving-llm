In the given maze, represented by an adjacency list, the challenge is to identify a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The edges in the adjacency list define directly connected grid points in the maze. Here's the reasoning broken down step-by-step:

1. **Interpreting the Adjacency List**: The provided list explicitly describes which pairs of cells are directly connected (neighboring). These connections can be represented as graph edges where each cell is a node.

2. **Visualization and Connection Mapping**: The edges such as (1,3) <--> (1,2) show movements in horizontal or vertical directions. No diagonal movements are implied. The approach is to start from (0,0) and seek a connecting path to (3,3) through the available direct connections.

3. **Pathfinding**: One technique for traversing and finding paths in such graph structures is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) which ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph (all edges have the same weight or cost, in this context, just the step between nodes). From (0,0), the BFS will explore all neighboring nodes recursively until (3,3) is reached.

4. **Building the Solution Path**:
    - Pathfinding through BFS will explore several paths. It starts from (0,0), checks all possible paths by going through each adjacent node, and keeps track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
    - In this process, it would construct paths such as (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) and so on, continuously checking each node's neighbors to find the shortest route to (3,3).

5. **Execute and Formulate the Output**: Once the BFS concludes (finding (3,3)), the path traced back from the target to the origin using the BFS parent pointers would yield the solution pathway.

By following the approach from above, here's deducing the specific solution for the maze given:
   - Start at (0,0), move to (0,1). 
   - Next, move from (0,1) to (0,2).
   - From (0,2) you can move to either (1,2) or (0,3). Choose (1,2) which appears more central and direct towards the target.
   - From (1,2) move to (1,3).
   - Then from (1,3), move to (2,3).
   - Finally, from (2,3) move to (3,3) which is the target.

Therefore, the solution for the maze, formatted as per the request is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each coordinate corresponds to a step in the sequence derived from the BFS exploration that connects the origin to the target, providing a valid and likely optimal solution given the paths explained in the adjacency list.
