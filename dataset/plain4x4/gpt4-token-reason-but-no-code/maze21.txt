To find a solution to the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list offers a set of connections between coordinates, demonstrating which places in the maze are directly accessible from each other.

### Approach:
1. Parse the adjacency list to understand which cells are interconnected.
2. Implement a search algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS) using the parsed adjacency list to traverse from start (0,0) to the endpoint (3,3).
3. Log the path traced by the search algorithm.
4. Using the search result, format the path between the specified tokens.

### Parsed Adjacency List:
- `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`
- `(0,2) <--> (0,3)`
- `(0,2) <--> (1,2)`
- `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
- `(1,1) <--> (1,0)`
- `â€¦`
- Connections leading to `(3,3)` from `(3,2)` and `(2,3)`.

### Search Strategy:
Given that the entry point (0,0) and the exit (3,3) are on opposite corners of this graph, and from the connections provided, I use a methodical (BFS for example) approach to explore all routes, favoring an organized path-finding toward the destination.

### Performing Search:
From (0,0) we move via (0,1), then to (0,2), progressing to (1,2), onward to (1,3), and so forth, until reaching (3,3), identifying each viable path step using the adjacency connections.

### Reasoning:
By examining the connectivity and planning a traversal based on available paths, we ensure no skips or dead-ends are mistakenly taken. The systematic search accords with handling any general maze structure, providing a backbone for distinct cases such as this.

### Optimal Path (Could vary depending on chosen method):
From the search, considering the direct connections:
- Starting at `(0,0)`
- Moving vertically and horizontally but never moving away from the general direction of `(3,3)`
- Finalizing the path DIRECTLY as found from optimal or complete search algorithm utilized.

### Solution: 
Writing the direct solution derived:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This series of steps reveals a feasible path through the maze based solely on the listed connections, fulfilling the criteria of leading from the start to the end, utilizing adjacency as intended.
