To find a solution for the given maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) because these methods allow us to explore reachable nodes (or "rooms" in this case of a maze) starting from a given node (the maze's entry point) while maintaining a record of the path. In this maze configuration, we are to find a path from coordinate (0,0) to coordinate (3,3).

The adjacency list provided lists all possible movements between connected rooms. Hence, using the BFS algorithm will be beneficial to search for the shortest path from the starting node (0,0) to the target node (3,3). BFS explores neighbors level by level, marking nodes as visited, and keeps track of the path using a queue structured to ensure nodes are processed in the order they are reached.

Given the maze described:
- Start at (0,0)
- Explore direct neighbors first, then neighbors of neighbors, and so on.
- Stop when reaching (3,3) or no more nodes are left to explore.

Let's use this structure to find the path, accounting for all pairs in the adjacency list and cross-referencing with the maze's logical layout:

1. Start at (0,0), the possible move from the adjacency list is to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can go to either (2,0) or back to (0,0). Proceed to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), we can go to either (3,0) or back to (1,0). Let's move to (3,0).
4. At (3,0), the only adjacent from the list is (3,1).
5. Moving from (3,1) to the next accessible coordinate (3,2).
6. Then from (3,2) continue to (3,3), the target.

This path successfully gets from (0,0) to (3,3) navigating through a series of connected corridors or rooms as per given adjacency.

Formatted result:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This represents a viable path from the maze's entry to its exit, traced via BFS logic and adhering to the connection restrictions in the adjacency list.
