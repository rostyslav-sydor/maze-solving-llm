To solve the maze provided as an adjacency list of cell coordinates, the goal is to find a path from the start location (0,0) to the end location (3,3). The adjacency list format specifies which cells are directly reachable from each other, making it possible to visualize or traverse the maze using common pathfinding algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

In this case:

- **DFS** could start at the beginning cell and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This method, however, might yield a longer path if not guided or checked against conditions for path length.
  
- **BFS** is generally preferred for its ability to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs. This approach explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to cells at the next depth level.

Using BFS here is beneficial due to several reasons:
1. **BFS is Complete and Optimal**: Since BFS explores the layers in increasing distance order, it will find the shortest path to the target if it exists.
2. **Guarantee Finding a Path**: Adjacency list directly lays out reachable cells, thus BFS can systematically test all possible routes, confirming whether a path exists or not.

To solve this specific maze represented by the provided adjacency list and find the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`, here is the reasoning for proposed BFS approach:

1. Start BFS from `(0,0)`, exploring all directly connected cells. From `(0,0)`, possible moves based on the list are to `(0,1)`.
2. Next, from `(0,1)`, move options are `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`. Since `(0,0)` has already been visited, the next cell to explore would be `(0,2)`.
3. Continue with this logic, each time marking cells visited to prevent cycles, until `(3,3)` is reached or all possible paths are explored indicating no path exists.

By exhaustively applying BFS:
- Starting at `(0,0)`, move to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, move next to `(0,2)`.
- Next, from `(0,2)`, you can move to both `(0,3)` and `(1,2)`. From here continue to `(1,3)`.
- Continue from `(1,3)` to `(2,3)` and then from `(2,3)` to `(3,3)`.

Thus, the path derived from this maze's adjacency list using BFS and ensuring to maintain a track of previously visited cells is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path listing traverses a feasible route from the start to the target as explicated by the reasoning and move-by-move expansion in accordance with the adjacency list's connections.
