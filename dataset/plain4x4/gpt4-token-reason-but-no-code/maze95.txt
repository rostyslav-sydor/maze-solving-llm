In this problem, we need to find a path through a maze represented as an adjacency list between two specific points in a graph. The graph's nodes are grid positions represented by (x, y) coordinates and the edges denote pathways directly between points.

The adjacency list for the given maze is:
```
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(0,3) <--> (0,2)
(1,1) <--> (2,1)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
```

We need a solution from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`. This can be approached by systematically checking each accessible node from the origin, tracking paths (preferably using a breadth-first search or depth-first search strategy considering this is an unweighted graph), and determining the path to the target.

Considering the provided adjacency list and employing a systematic exploration algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), which is suitable because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, these connections lead to the solution:

1. Starting from `(0,0)`, the only possible move is to `(0,1)` via `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, we go to `(0,2)` using `(0,2) <--> (0,1)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, go to `(0,3)` using `(0,3) <--> (0,2)`.
4. From `(0,3)`, we can move to `(1,3)` through `(0,3) <--> (1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)`, paths are open to `(2,3)` using `(2,3) <--> (1,3)`.
6. From `(2,3)`, finally move to `(3,3)` using `(2,3) <--> (3,3)`.

Having traversed the graph using steps that ensure we advance validly through connected nodes per the adjacency list, a path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` is achieved through the sequence listed above.

Therefore, the succinct solution path is formatted as:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path is the most direct one that fulfills the necessary connection requirements posed by the adjacency list and reaches the designated target point from the origin successfully.
