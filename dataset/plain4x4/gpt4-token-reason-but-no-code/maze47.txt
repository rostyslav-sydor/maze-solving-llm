The maze is presented with its structure defined by an adjacency list that graphically represents connections between various points or nodes. The given start point (origin) is at (0,0) and the destination (target) is at (3,3).

To solve the maze, consider paths linking adjacent nodes leading from the origin to the target. Using breadth-first search (BFS) is ideal as it explores equally from the start node, moving outward gradually and retrieving the shortest path first in an unweighted grid-like maze. DFS, while deep, often isn't as efficient for shortest path retrieval in such mazes unless paired with backtracking, which is more complex to implement.

Given the maze, construct BFS from (0,0): 
1. Start at `(0,0)`, move to adjacent nodes;
2. Neighbors `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` are reachable from `(0,0)`. Investigate both;
3. Continue exploring outward in levels:
   - From `(0,1)`, reach `(0,2)`.
   - From `(0,2)`, reach `(0,3)`.
   - From `(0,3)`, reach `(1,3)`.
   - From `(1,3)`, reach further until potentially impacting target `(3,3)`.

Process all viable routes explored until `(3,3)` is encountered. Trace back the succession of moves from the target to the origin, yielding the path needed.

Using adjacency relations and systematically processing BFS will specify a valid and efficient path between start and target. Mapping these steps using BFS would lead to finding the shortest path as marked by node connections as per the maze's adjacency list format.

For this specific maze, a plausible shortest path found using this technique would be:
- Start at `(0,0)`, then proceed to `(0,1)`.
- Continue to `(0,2)`, then to `(0,3)`.
- Move to `(1,3)`, then progress to `(2,3)`.
- Final move to `(3,3)`.

Thus, the solution path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` expressed in the required format is:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`.
