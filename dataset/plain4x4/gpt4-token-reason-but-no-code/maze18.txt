The maze provided is described using an adjacency list representation where each coordinate pair is connected to at least one other coordinate pair. The task is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

To solve this maze, we can use a common graph traversal algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here, BFS is a good choice as it will find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, which is ideal for a maze-solving context. The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

The maze in adjacency list format shows connection between various coordinate pairs. We interpret these pairs as nodes and their connections as edges.

Starting from the origin (0,0), and moving in BFS order, we look for all reachable nodes. We keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisits and use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored. For each node, we also track the path used to get there so we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target.

Given the adjacency list:
- **(1,0) ↔ (0,0)**: From (0,0) we can go to (1,0).
- **(1,0) ↔ (2,0)**: From (1,0) we reach (2,0).
- **(2,0) ↔ (2,1)**; From (2,0) progressing to (2,1).
- **(2,1) ↔ (2,2)**; Then from (2,1) to (2,2).
- **(1,2) ↔ (1,3)**; (3,2) ↔ (2,2)**; (3,2) ↔ (3,3)** allows moving from (2,2) to (3,2) and finally to (3,3).

Thus, piecing together the route using the above connections, progressing logically from the origin to the target, your pathway through the maze follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is determined based on available connections in the adjacency list that allow a BFS traversal from origin to target, ensuring every step is connected as defined.
