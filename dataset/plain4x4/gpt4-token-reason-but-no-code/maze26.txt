To solve the maze given as an adjacency list, an efficient approach would be using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly useful in this context because it explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures that BFS finds the shortest path from the maze's entry point to the exit point, if one exists.

Given the adjacency list and noting the coordinates marked as origin (entry point) and target (exit point), I'll describe a BFS approach:

1. **Start from the Origin:** Since BFS uses a queue, initialize the queue with the origin point, which is (0,0), and also maintain a list or dictionary to track visited nodes to prevent re-processing.

2. **Explore Neighbors:** For each node dequeued, check its adjacency in the list for all connected nodes (neighbors). For this problem, the adjacency list provides direct connections between points, so they can be directly used to enqueue new points to explore.

3. **Path Reconstruction:** By maintaining a dictionary mapping each point to its predecessor, we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target (exit point) by backtracking from the target to the origin.

4. **End Condition:** The process stops when we either find the target point or exhaust all possible paths without finding the exit.

By applying the BFS steps to the provided adjacency list and exploring systematically, the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) is identified:

- Start from (0,0), check neighbors, move to (1,0).
- From (1,0), explore to (2,0), then (3,0).
- From (3,0), moving sequentially via (3,1) then to (2,1) as permitted, leading finally to (2,2).
- From (2,2) proceed to (2,3), and then finally reach (3,3).

Thus, the BFS traversal from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) following the valid shortest path elements from the adjacency list results in the solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This answer provides the specific shortest path through the maze based on its adjacency list using BFS as the solving strategy. The chosen path ensures that the solution is efficient and reaches the destination navigating through valid paths.
