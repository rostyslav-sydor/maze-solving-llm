To solve the maze described, we first need to clearly understand the graph's structure that forms the maze. The adjacency list presented provides connections between different points (nodes) in a grid format, with coordinates (row, column) representing each node.

Next, we define the start (entry) and end (exit) points of the maze:
- Start point: (0,0)
- End point: (3,3)

Understanding and Translating the Adjacency List:
- Nodes in the maze are connected in a bidirectional manner (i.e., if (a, b) is connected to (c, d), then (a, b) can be visited from (c, d) and vice versa).
- We can visualize these nodes and their connections, forming paths that lead from the start point to the end point.

By analyzing the adjacency list, a possible path from (0,0) to (3,3) can be planned. We proceed with a simple pathfinding approach, considering the connections available.

**Pathfinding Reasoning:**
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Choose among available paths that lead towards the goal (in general, moving towards increasing row and column values as the endpoint is (3,3)).
3. Continue navigating through the graph considering the connections until reaching the endpoint. Whenever there's a choice, prefer a direction that vectorially points towards the goal, unless it leads to a dead end or previously visited node (recursive pathfinding might be needed, tracing back if a dead end is encountered).

Now, let's trace such a path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0). Options: move to (1,0) or (0,1).
2. (0,1) provides a direct path towards increasing row index (downwards or rightwards direction preferred). Next: (1,1) or (0,2).
3. Moving from (0,1) to (1,1). Next options: (2,1).
4. From (1,1) to (2,1). Now, opt for (2,2).
5. From (2,1) to (2,2). Proceed to (2,3).
6. From (2,2) to (2,3), then to (3,3). 

**Final Path Taken:**
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Proceed to (1,1)
- Then go to (2,1)
- Move to (2,2)
- Head to (2,3)
- Finally reach (3,3)

Given this walk-through, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Through this method, the chosen path navigates through the maze from start (0,0) to destination (3,3), taking into account immediate possible directions leading towards the destination and avoiding backtracking where possible. This solution provides a clear way to navigate the maze using connected paths.
