To find the solution for the given maze, which is represented as an adjacency list, one effective approach would be to use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth First Search (BFS). BFS ensures that we explore all locations that are at the current depth before moving on to paths that are deeper in the graph. This feature is advantageous for grid-based maze solving as it guarantees the shortest path from the start coordinate to the end coordinate if one exists.

### Understanding the Maze Structure
- The maze is read as a graph with complex connections described using coordinates.
- The entry point based on text is (0,0).
- The exit point is (3,3).

### Plan
Using BFS, start from (0,0), then systematically explore all reachable vertices (or cells), working layer by layer. By keeping track of each cellâ€™s predecessor, we can reconstruct the path once we reach (3,3).

### Algorithm Details
1. Create a queue and enqueue the starting vertex (0,0) with its path as list [(0,0)].
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the foremost vertex.
3. Check all its directly connected neighbors (from adjlist).
4. If a neighboring vertex has not been visited, mark it and enqueue it with the path leading to it.
5. If the vertex is the target (3,3), then we have found our path.

### Applying BFS to the maze
Given neighbors:
- (1,3) <-> (2,3), (3,3), (0,3)
- (2,3) <-> (2,2), (1,3)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2), (1,3)
- (3,2) <-> (2,2), (3,3)
- (2,2) <-> (2,3), (3,2)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3), (0,2)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0), (2,1)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1), (2,0)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1), (1,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0), (2,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2), (0,0)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2), (0,1)
- (0,0) <-> (0,1), (1,0)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1), (0,0)

### Execution of BFS
1. Start from (0,0) -> [(0,0)]
2. Visit (0,1) -> [(0,0), (0,1)]
3. Visit (1,0) -> [(0,0), (1,0)]
4. From (1,0), visit (1,1)
5. Continue this manner to explore all options, while keeping the shortest path:
  - Path becomes (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

### Solution
The short path found by BFS mechanism through the maze (from entry to exit) is then:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This approach guarantees the identification of the shortest path in the maze if one is available, given the properties of BFS technique. Through reasonable systematic vertex examination based on the described adjacency list, the BFS enables the construction of the path from the starting point to the target efficiently.
