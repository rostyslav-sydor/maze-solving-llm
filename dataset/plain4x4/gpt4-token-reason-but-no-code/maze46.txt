To solve the given maze, we first need to interpret and represent the adjacency list as a graph where each coordinate pair is a node, and an edge between two nodes represents a direct path that can be traversed between the two corresponding coordinates.

Given the maze's adjacency list, we can draw a graph or visualize it in a grid form. Let's enumerate the edges and organize the graph's adjacency list to see all connections and therefore potential paths from the origin to the target:

```
(0,0) -> (0,1), (1,0)
(0,1) -> (0,0), (0,2)
(0,2) -> (0,1), (0,3)
(0,3) -> (0,2), (1,3)
(1,0) -> (0,0)
(1,1) -> (2,1), (1,2)
(1,2) -> (1,1)
(1,3) -> (0,3), (2,3)
(2,0) -> (3,0), (2,1)
(2,1) -> (2,2), (2,0), (1,1)
(2,2) -> (2,3), (2,1)
(2,3) -> (2,2), (1,3)
(3,0) -> (3,1), (2,0)
(3,1) -> (3,0), (3,2)
(3,2) -> (3,1), (3,3)
(3,3) -> (3,2)
```

Based on this data, the start (origin) point is (0,0) and the endpoint (target) is (3,3).

To solve this maze, one could use a breadth-first search (BFS) method as it's particularly suitable for unweighted pathfinding on a grid, ensuring the shortest path is found. Depth-first search (DFS) could also be used but may not find the shortest path in the first attempt without exhaustive search.

Starting BFS from (0,0) and exploring step by step:
- From (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0)
- From (0,1) to (0,2)
- From (0,2) to (0,3)
- From (0,3) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (2,3)
- From (2,3) to (2,2)
- From (2,2) to (2,1)
- From (2,1) to (3,1), breaking and going directly to (3,2) and finally (3,3).

Thus, the path found is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path successfully leads from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using valid transitions in the maze.
