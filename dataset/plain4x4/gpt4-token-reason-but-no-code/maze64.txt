To solve the given maze depicted as an adjacency list, we can make use of a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms are effective for exploring all the nodes (or coordinates in this maze) and finding a path between two specified points, if such a path exists.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Graph Structure:** We are given an adjacency list that represents connections between various coordinates in a grid. Each coordinate (node) is connected to one or more other coordinates.
2. **Starting and Ending Points:** We need to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.
3. **Graph Traversal:** Using BFS, we can systematically explore nodes level by level, ensuring we find the shortest path. BFS is generally preferred for this task in an unweighted grid like this, as it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

**Process:**
1. Start the BFS from the origin `(0,0)`. Place it in a queue and mark it as visited.
2. Iteratively explore each adjacent node. For each node, mark it as visited and store its predecessor. This helps in later reconstructing the path once we reach the target node.
3. Once we reach the target `(3,3)`, backtrack using the stored predecessors to determine the exact path taken.
4. Output the path from the origin to the target.

**Implementation Details:**
Using the BFS traversal:
- Start at `(0,0)`.
- Move to `(1,0)` (since itâ€™s directly connected).
- Then visit `(1,1)`, connecting further to `(2,1)`.
- Continue towards `(3,1)`, then `(3,2)`, and finally reach `(3,3)`.

**Solution Path:**
The BFS ensures that we find the shortest possible route (if multiple solutions exist) from the origin to the destination. Based on the connections from the adjacency list, using BFS leads us through the path:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path ensures that each step is connected as per the adjacency list setup and leads us directly from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)`.
