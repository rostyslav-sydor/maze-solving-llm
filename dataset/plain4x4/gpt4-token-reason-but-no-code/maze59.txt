In order to solve the maze from the given adjacency list and locate the pathway from the origin to the target, we'll need to trace the possible paths between the origin `(0,0)` and the target `(3,3)`. The adjacency list provides all direct connections between points on the grid, and we have to use this information to navigate through the maze, ensuring we only use valid paths.

The maze solving process typically utilizes breadth-first or depth-first search algorithms for tracing paths in such graph-based representations. Let's use a straightforward approach to navigate from the origin to the target:

1. **Start Point**: `(0,0)`, **End Point (Target)**: `(3,3)`

2. Based on the adjacency list details, trace all possible paths that initiate from `(0,0)` and explore each connected point, while keeping track of visited locations to avoid looping.

3. **Path Exploration**:
   - From the start `(0,0)`, we have connections to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
   - Continue from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)` and proceed to `(3,0)`.
   - From `(3,0)`, advance to `(3,1)`, and then to `(3,2)`.
   - From `(3,2)` proceed to `(3,3)`, which is the endpoint.

This path optimization notably only uses valid connections as per the provided adjacency list and moves directly towards the target's column or row, when possible. The sequence of moves should be the shortest path in this adjacency graph without any redundant deviations.

**Output in Required Format**:
   `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This sequence allows us to traverse from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` efficiently, ensuring that at each step, the path leads closer to the target. This reasoning and path have been derived by directly exploiting the connectedness laid out in the adjacency list, choosing paths which continually progress towards the final target coordinates, and avoiding cycles by not revisiting any node.
