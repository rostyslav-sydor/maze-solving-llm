To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list format, I'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Represent the Maze as a Graph**: The given adjacency list defines all the possible movements between nodes (coordinates) in the maze. Each pair in the list corresponds to two connected nodes.

2. **Set Start and End Points**: The start (`origin`) is at (0,0) and the end (`target`) is at (3,3).

3. **Find a Path From Start to End**: A pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search) is suitable for unweighted graphs like our maze. BFS explores nodes in layers based on their distance from the source point, which is optimal for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

4. **Trace the Path**: Once BFS reaches the target node, it can trace back to the origin using a predecessor array (or similar structure) that keeps track of how each node was reached. This step reconstructs the path from start to finish.

**Implementation of Steps in the Context of Provided Maze**:
- Convert the adjacency representation into a usable graph structure.
- Use BFS to explore from the origin (0,0) to all accessible nodes.
- Once the target (3,3) is found, backtrack from the target to the origin to determine the path.

**Reasoned Path**:
Starting at (0,0), we analyze possible moves:
- Move from (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (0,2)
- From (0,2) to (0,3), and then from (0,3) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (2,3), and finally from (2,3) to (3,3)

This direct traversal through the grid efficiently uses each adjacency connection and moves us toward the target in an orderly fashion.

**The Solution**:
- This path plan starts at (0,0), moves in a straight line vertically to (0,3), ascends to (1,3), crosses the boundary to (2,3), and finally ascends to the terminal point at (3,3).

Thus, the specific solution path through the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This list indicates each coordinate passed through from the maze's entry point to its exit point, tracking movements that correspond directly to the edges described in the adjacency list.
