To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list describes all possible movements between connected points in the maze.

Starting from the origin, we'll explore reachable vertices using the connections provided until we reach the target. This can be achieved efficiently by either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is typically preferred for such tasks as it ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

In the maze's setup:
- Each point is defined by its coordinates (row, column).
- Each pair in the adjacency list defines a direct connection between two points.

By using BFS, which considers all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, we can ensure the shortest path from the origin to the target.

From the adjacency list:
1. `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
2. Continuing this adjacency exploration will let us list out the paths step by step until we get to `(3,3)`.

**Step-by-step BFS Execution:**
- Start BFS from `(0,0)`.
- From `(0,0)`, we can go to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
- From `(0,1)`, go to `(0,2)`.
- From `(1,0)`, go to `(2,0)`, but it's further from target compared to other paths.
- From `(0,2)`, reach `(0,3)`.
- Then reach `(1,3)` from `(0,3)`.
- From `(1,3)`, proceed to `(2,3)`.
- Finally, from `(2,3)` go to `(3,3)` which is our target.

The path collected by BFS ensuring shortest route:
- Visit `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,3)`, and finally `(3,3)`.

Thus, based on the BFS exploration and adjacency relationships provided in the task, the solution to navigate from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path leads sequentially through allowed moves from the start to the end of the maze, covering each step in the shortest manner as defined by the adjacency relationships.
