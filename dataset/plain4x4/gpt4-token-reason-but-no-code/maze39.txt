To tackle this problem, we can model the maze as a graph where each cell in the maze corresponds to a vertex, and each connection between two cells represents an edge. Given this, we can apply a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is effective in finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid-like structure such as this maze.

We start the BFS from the origin point, (0,0), and aim to reach the target point, (3,3). BFS will explore the adjacent vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the first time it encounters the target vertex, it has found the shortest path to it. In BFS, each node stores a reference to its predecessor, which enables reconstruction of the path once the target is reached.

Using the adjacency list representation provided, we note that:
- Each pair in the adjacency list represents a direct passageway (edge) between the two mentioned cells (vertices).
  
Following BFS on the provided representation:
1. Start at (0,0), exploring its adjacent vertices: (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to its adjacent vertices that haven't yet been visited: (0,2) and (1,1).
3. Proceed similarly from these newly added vertices:
   - From (0,2), you reach (1,2).
   - From (1,1), move to (2,1).
4. Continue the expansion:
   - (1,2) leads to (2,2).
   - (2,1) leads to (3,1) and connects back to previously visited (1,1).
5. Further from (2,2), move to (2,3).
6. From (3,1), advance to (3,0) and also to previously visited vertices.
7. Explore from (2,3) to reach (1,3) and (3,3).
8. Finally, (3,3) is reached, concluding the search as this is our target.

Reconstructing the path from (0,0) to (3,3) by following back the predecessors leads to the path:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Thus, the shortest path in the maze from (0,0) to (3,3) has been deduced:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
