The adjacency list representation shows all the nodes and their connected neighbors in the maze. To find a solution, we must determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

From the maze structure:
- The origin point (0,0) is connected to (1,0) and (0,1).
- Every connection allows bidirectional movement.

I'll trace possible paths forward:
1. Start at (0,0), which leads to (1,0) and also to (0,1).
2. If we move to (0,1), next we can move to (0,2), then to (0,3).
3. From (0,3), movement is possible to (1,3).
4. From (1,3), we can head to (1,2). 
5. At (1,2), another move is possible to (2,2).
6. Moving from (2,2), one can head to (2,3).
7. Now, (2,3) connects directly to (3,3), which is our target.

Thus, the path from the origin to the target, navigating based on the connectivity provided and ensuring all moves lead towards the target without looping excessively or diverging from the reachable path, can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is efficiently following the maze structure strictly adhering to the adjacency directions, ensuring a direct route to the destination avoids backtracking or unnecessary detours, given the constraints provided by the adjacency list.
