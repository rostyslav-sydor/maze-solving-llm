To solve the provided maze problem, we can conceptualize it as a traversal issue in a graph where nodes represent different sections of the maze and the edges represent valid paths between these sections. The goal in a maze solving situation is generally to navigate from a designated start point to an end point.

From the adjacency list provided, we construct a graph model which represents the maze. Each pair (x,y) forms a node, and nodes are connected based on the specified adjacency. For example, from the list, `(1,0) <--> (2,0)` indicates a direct path between these two nodes.

Here, the start point (origin) is provided as `(0,0)` and the target (exit) is `(3,3)`. Our aim is to find a path that starts from `(0,0)` and reaches `(3,3)` traversing through valid node connections.

The most common methods to deal with this type of problem are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). DFS explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking, which sometimes leads to inefficient routes in large graphs. BFS, on the other hand, explores all the neighboring vertices at the present depth, prior to moving on to vertices at the next depth level, and generally finds a shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

In applying BFS:
1. Start from the initial node `(0,0)`.
2. Explore each connected node as per adjacency list.
3. Use a queue to manage nodes to explore and a set or list to track visited nodes, ensuring no node is revisited.
4. Build the path as part of the exploration process.
5. The first complete path reaching `(3,3)` will be the shortest in an unweighted setting like this due to BFS properties.

After applying BFS to the adjacency information provided, the following path is revealed as both feasible and efficient given the maze's constraints:

- Begin at the start point `(0,0)`.
- Move to `(1,0)` as it is directly connected.
- Then move to `(2,0)`, following with `(3,0)` as per adjacency relationships.
- Despite `(3,1)` being connected to `(3,0)`, exploring `(3,0)` to `(3,1)` to `(3,2)` leads to an additional unnecessary movement, so instead we take `(2,0)` to `(2,1)`.
- From `(2,1)`, a move to `(2,2)` follows, and then to `(1,2)`, improving closeness to `(1,3)`.
- The path could then continue directly from `(1,2)` to `(1,3)` and straight to `(2,3)` and finally to the target at `(3,3)`.

Post this BFS approach and analysis, the discovered path sequence gives us:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this manner, we ascertain the shortest route through the maze using BFS and list the steps in sequence as asked.
