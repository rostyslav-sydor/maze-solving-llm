To solve this maze using the provided adjacency list, we approach the problem by constructing a graph from the adjacency relationships specified between nodes, which are represented as coordinates of locations within the maze. Each node (coordinate) is connected to one or more nodes, outlining possible paths from any starting position to a destination within the maze.

For the maze given, the start point (origin) is (0,0) and the target (exit) is (3,3). To find a solution, we perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the origin. BFS is ideal for this since it explores the graph level-by-level, thus ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one is found. BFS would systematically explore all neighbors of a node before moving on to the neighbors of those neighbors. This way, as soon as we encounter the destination node during our BFS traversal, we can be certain that the path taken to get there is the shortest possible path.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving this maze:
1. Initialize a queue with the start point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. For each step, dequeue the next node and explore its connected nodes (neighbors), marking new nodes as visited and enqueueing them.
3. Each time a node is dequeued, record its predecessor, allowing us to trace the path back to the start once we reach the target.
4. Once the target is reached, backtrack from the target node to the origin using the recorded predecessors to reconstruct the path taken.
5. This path is then the shortest route from the entry to the exit of the maze.

For the maze provided, considering the adjacency relationships mentioned, executing BFS will lead us to discover the following path sequence from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Starting at (0,0), you can move to (0,1), then to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), advance to (1,2), then to (2,2).
3. From (2,2), go to (3,2), and from there, proceed to (3,3) which is the exit.

Thus, the solution to the maze goes through the following coordinates in sequence: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

Presenting the solution in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This forms the shortest path through the maze from the origin to the target, based on the provided adjacency list.
