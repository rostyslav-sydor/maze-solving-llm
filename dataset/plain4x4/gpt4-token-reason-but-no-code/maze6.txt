The maze you've provided is structured as an adjacency list of coordinates depicting which points are connected directly in a grid. The problem is essentially to find a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3). In graph terms, this can be approached using path-finding algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Starting with the origin (0,0), we explore reachable nodes step-by-step, marking nodes as visited to avoid cycles, while tracing our path to the destination. Given that BFS offers the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, using BFS can be particularly effective. In a BFS approach, each node level (neighboring nodes) is fully explored before moving onto the next level, ensuring the shortest path is found when first reaching the target node. 

Following the provided adjacency list and implementing BFS, we examine and queue each neighbor of the current node until we reach the target node (3,3). Keeping track of our node's predecessor allows us to reconstruct the path once we find the end point.

Upon backtracking from the end point (3,3) by following predecessors, the calculated shortest path in your maze, considering the graph structure and node connections provided, is as follows:

- Start at (0,0), then to (0,1) via a connected path.
- From (0,1) move to (0,2), continuing the path.
- Then move from (0,2) to (1,2).
- Next step to (1,3) from (1,2).
- Then move from (1,3) to (0,3).
- Then edge to (2,3) from (0,3).
- And finally arrive at (3,3) from (2,3).

The resulting path traverses from the start to the goal moving through connected nodes, ensuring each move is valid and directly connected as per the adjacency list provided.

Thus, the formatted solution for this specific maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is one of the paths derived from the structure of the maze connections which represents a solution to navigating from the entry to the exit.
