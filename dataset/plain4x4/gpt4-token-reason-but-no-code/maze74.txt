To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list of graph nodes, we need to find a path from the entry (origin) point (0,0) to the exit (target) point (3,3).

The first step in solving the maze is understanding the connections:
- The adjacency list tells us directly which points (nodes) can be traversed from a starting node. 
- The output specifies a connecting path between adjacent points on this graph via tokens (e.g., (2,3) <--> (1,3)).

To solve it, a pathfinding algorithm would normally be used in programming, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), or Dijkstra's Algorithm, to navigate from the origin to the target point. These algorithms search through the connections (edges in the graph) to find a valid path from start to finish. Though not computing here, the reasoning involves:
1. Starting at the origin (0,0), looking at the connections.
2. Choosing a path based on the available nodes connected to the current node.
3. Tracking back if a dead-end is reached (DFS) or exploring all possible paths and choosing the shortest (BFS/Dijkstra).

Here is the solution reasoning for finding the path from (0,0) to (3,3):
- Start at (0,0), which connects to (1,0) and (0,1).
- From (0,1), move to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move to (0,3).
- From (0,3), go to (1,3).
- From (1,3), go to (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (2,2).
- From (2,2), proceed to (3,2).
- Then from (3,2), move to (3,3), which is the target.

This path navigates through a series of connected nodes, moving row by row, column by column, where possible and aiming for the destination.

The solution for this maze in the requested format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequential list of coordinates represents a clear route from the entry point to the exit point in the maze as depicted in the adjacency graph provided.
