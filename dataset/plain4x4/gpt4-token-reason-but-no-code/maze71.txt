The maze you provided can be interpreted as a graph where each node corresponds to a coordinate in the maze, and edges signify direct passages between adjacent nodes. To solve the maze, we must find a route from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3).

The adjacency list provided details all possible connections between nodes:

- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0) 
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)

Starting at the origin point (0,0), the path to the target (3,3) can be traced by exploring the connections while ensuring we progress towards the destination without looping back on already visited nodes.

From the adjacency, we can identify the paths step by step through the connected nodes:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. From (0,0), we can move to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), go to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), progress to (2,1).
5. From (2,1), go to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), move to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), go to (3,3), which is the destination.

Each move was selected based on connected pathways and trying to progress towards the target without retracing steps or moving away from the destination. This ensured an efficient and direct route to the exit.

So, translating into the specified format, the solution for the maze is presented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
