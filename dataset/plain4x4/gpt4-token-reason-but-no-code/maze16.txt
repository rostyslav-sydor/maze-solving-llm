To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3).

The adjacency list format describes all possible connections between various points in the maze, depicting a graph where each coordinate represents a vertex and each connection ("<-->") represents an edge between two vertices. By interpreting the maze as a graph, we can apply various pathfinding algorithms to find a path from the origin to the target.

One common algorithm for such purposes is the Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is particularly well-suited for this kind of problem because it finds the shortest path between two points in an unweighted graph.

In the provided adjacency list, the connections can be translated into a more usable form to script or implement BFS. Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS would systematically explore all accessible connecting coordinates, eventually determining a route—if one exists—to the target (3,3).

**Steps of BFS for provided maze**:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Explore all possible movements from each explored node.
3. Queue each newly discovered node and mark as visited.
4. Continue exploring till the queue is empty or till the target node (3,3) is reached.
5. If reached, backtrace from the target node to the origin to chart the path.

Upon analyzing the connections from the adjacency list:
1. (0,0) connects to (0,1) which then connects to (0,2).
2. (0,2) connects to (0,3) and (0,3) connects to (1,3).
3. (1,3) connects to (2,3) and finally, (2,3) connects to (3,3).

Thus, following BFS from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we derive the path:

**Solution:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is consistent with BFS's characteristic of finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, and each step is validated against the adjacency list to ensure viability and correctness.
