To find a solution for the maze, we first need to understand the structure provided by the adjacency list, which represents all the possible movements between nodes (coordinates) in the maze. Each pair shows direct connections between cells where movement is possible. The task is to find a route from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3).

Given the adjacency information, a suitable method to find the path is using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or other pathfinding algorithms. In this context, because the maze is not overly large or complex, a basic BFS will suffice due to its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze.

By processing the adjacency list and using BFS, where each node represents a coordinate on the maze grid and edges represent valid movements from one coordinate to another, we can trace the path from (0,0) to (3,3). The algorithm will explore all potential paths from the start and expand outwards until it finds the target node (3,3), ensuring that the shortest route is identified given the unweighted edges.

After setting up BFS and executing it based on the provided adjacency list, the shortest path found through my logical reasoning and understanding of how BFS would process the provided adjacency data is:

- Start at (0,0), where you can move either right to (1,0) or down to (0,1).
- From (0,1), proceed down to (0,2).
- From (0,2), you can go either right to (1,2) or up to (0,1) (but going up would be backtracking, so choose right).
- From (1,2), you can move either up to (1,1), right to (2,2) or up to (1,3) (choosing up toward (1,3) because it progresses towards the goal at the upper right).
- Finally, from (1,3), move right to (2,3), and then to (3,3).

This path does not revisit any node unnecessarily and provides a direct route to the target. So, the solution to the maze in the specified format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This format clearly shows the sequence of moves from the starting point at the top-left of the maze grid to the finishing point at the bottom-right.
