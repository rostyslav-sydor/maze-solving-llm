To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we first need to understand the structure by interpreting the list as connections between coordinates in a grid.

### Maze Connections Observations:
- From the adjacency list, we see that every pair of points `(x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2)` represents a possible path, allowing movement between these two points in the maze. 
- The origin and target are explicitly mentioned: from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.

### Plan:
1. We interpret the adjacency list to understand how the maze can be navigated.
2. Use a pathfinding algorithm mentally, like breadth-first search (BFS) which is ideal for unweighted graphs like this, where each connection has an equal "cost" or "distance".
   
### Ideal Path Selection:
- Starting from `(0,0)` we can navigate using connected paths.
- We follow connections showing the shortest pathways moving in directions that progressively lead towards the destination `(3,3)` without retracing steps, unless necessary.

### Interpretation of Adjacency List for Pathfinding:
1. Begin navigating at `(0,0)`, which is directly connected to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, move to `(0,2)`, then to `(0,3)`.
3. Move from `(0,3)` to `(1,3)` and continue to `(2,3)`.
4. Finally, from `(2,3)` move to `(3,3)` which is the target.

### Verifying the Minimum Path:
- Each step between connected nodes in our chosen path is necessary to head towards the final goal `(3,3)`.
- No backtracking or unnecessary detours are taken.

### Conclusion:
Following the paths laid out by the adjacency connections, the best path identified reaches the target efficiently, covering essential nodes only. The method uses a straightforward grid movement, tracking progression from the entry at the bottom-left to the exit at the top-right of the given grid, matching the origin and target points specified.

Thus, the solution for navigating the maze from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` is traced as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

These steps provide a clear, direct route from the entrance to the exit of the maze as per the adjacency list provided.
