To find a solution to the maze represented by the adjacency list given, we need to determine a path from the start coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using the connections provided.

The adjacency list represents all the direct connections between cells in the maze. Here's how we could logically approach finding the path:

1. Starting at (0,0), we look for nodes directly connected to it:
   - According to the adjacency list, from (0,0) the next possible step is (0,1).

2. From (0,1):
   - The list states (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (0,2). Since (0,0) is where we came from, our next move is to (0,2).

3. From (0,2):
   - The next connections are (0,3) and (0,1). Continuing forward, we move to (0,3).

4. From (0,3), following the list:
   - The only new connection available is (1,3).

5. From (1,3):
   - We can proceed to (2,3).

6. From (2,3):
   - The next steps can be either to (3,3) directly or backward to previous nodes.

Since our target coordinate is (3,3) and it is directly connected to (2,3), the path forward is clear.

Thus the solution (path) from (0,0) to (3,3) in the specified format would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution navigates node by node from start to finish, using the direct connections indicated in the adjacency list and maintaining a logical progression through the bounds of the specified maze, avoiding any unnecessary backtracking that doesn't lead to the eventual endpoint.
