To solve the maze outlined in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) through navigable connections. The format specifies that each pair of coordinates defines a two-way path between those points. We will use this information to trace a sequence of steps leading from the origin to the target.

Starting from (0,0), let's examine each option available:
1. From (0,0), we can go to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), we have the options to go to several points. A reasonable path is to (1,1) (considering we want to move mostly downwards or rightwards to reach the lower right corner where (3,3) is located).
3. Proceed from (1,1) to (2,1).
4. From (2,1) to (2,2).
5. From (2,2) to (3,2) (again moving towards the right direction).
6. Finally, from (3,2) to (3,3), reaching our target.

Therefore, the path taken from (0,0) to (3,3) via the given adjacencies is:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (1,1)
- Move to (2,1)
- Move to (2,2)
- Move to (3,2)
- Move to (3,3), which is our target.

This sequence ensures we are moving step by step according to the given connections and successfully navigate from the beginning to the end of the maze.

The specific path traced in the given format would hence be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
