To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here is the sequence of reasoning and processing untangled from the given relations:

1. **Understanding the Graph:**
   - The maze is defined as a graph where each node represents a coordinate point, and it is connected to another node if there is a direct passageway between them.

2. **Listed Connections:**
   - From the adjacency list, each pair like `(x1,y1) <--> (x2,y2)` means there is a direct route between `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)`.

3. **Graph Interpretation:**
   - Using this information, it is observed how each coordinate connects with others. Determining a useful path requires understanding possible routes from the starting point `(0,0)` to the end point `(3,3)` based on given connections.

4. **Finding the Path:**
   - This problem can be approached using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), but since the full algorithm and code are not requested, the straightforward way is to trace potential steps from the maze structure:
     - Start at (0,0), where you can go to (1,0) or (0,1).
     - Continue this way, examining neighbors at each step, choosing paths that head towards the target `(3,3)` without backtracking to previously visited nodes unless needed.

5. **Tracing Route to Target:**
   - Start at `(0,0)`. You can move to either `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`. Moving towards the bottom (increasing x-value) seems promising as it directly moves toward row 3.
   - Go to `(1,0)`, then from here, go to `(2,0)` (since moving in x-direction).
   - From `(2,0)`, move to `(3,0)` continuing southward.
   - Proceed from `(3,0)` to `(3,1)`, moving right.
   - Go from `(3,1)` to `(3,2)`, continue moving right.
   - Lastly, go from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)`.

6. **Explanation for Path Choice:**
   - The selected route effectively traverses along the bottom row of the coordinate grid from the left-most column to the right-most column as per the provided adjacency connections. This path is also efficient, as it continues progressively without unnecessary detours.

Outputting the solution path in the required format, considering we navigated the path explained:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This route is both directly towards the goal and adheres to the available connections specified, demonstrating a logical progression to solving the maze given its specific structure and connections.
