To solve this specific maze, which is given in the form of an adjacency list, we start by converting this adjacency information into a more tangible format, such as a graph data structure. From the adjacency list, we understand how each point (or "node") in the maze is connected to other points.

We identify the origin as (0,0) and the target as (3,3). Using a well-known pathfinding method like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores the maze level by level and is a guarantee to find the shortest path if it exists, we can track paths from the entry to the exit point. The idea behind BFS for maze-solving is to systematically explore all of the adjacent nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, using a queue to facilitate this process.

Given our setup:
1. **Start Point (Origin)**: (0,0)
2. **End Point (Target)**: (3,3)

From (0,0), we explore its immediate neighbors using the adjacency relationships defined, then gradually move outward in search of the target (3,3). For each step, we record the path taken.

To solve the maze with BFS:
- Begin at the origin (0,0) and mark it as visited.
- Explore and enqueue all connected nodes to (0,0), here (0,1).
- We next explore from (0,1) to its unvisited connections, (0,2) and (0,0); (0,0) is already visited.
- Continue this pattern checking and moving to unvisited nodes until reaching the goal (3,3).

By navigating the maze based on the adjacency information, and using BFS, let's explore this specific path from point to point:

- Start at (0,0), explore (0,1) because it's connected.
- From (0,1), move to (0,2).
- Since (0,2) connects to (1,2), move there next.
- From (1,2), go to (2,2).
- (2,2) connects to (2,3).
- Move from (2,3) to (3,3).

Based on the BFS technique and the maze's structure shared, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) would be as follows in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequential, direct path connecting origin to target outlines a clear route through the maze using breadths-first exploration logic.
