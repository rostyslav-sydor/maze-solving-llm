To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we transform the list into a graph data structure where each node represents a coordinate in the maze and edges represent possible paths between these coordinates. To find a path from the specified origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), suitable graph traversal algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). 

BFS is often preferred for shortest path solutions in an unweighted graph like this because it explores all possible nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.

1. **Initiate BFS from Origin (0,0):**
   - Start from (0,0) and explore its directly connected neighbors, add these to a queue.
   - Each node visited is marked to prevent revisiting and slowing down the algorithm or causing a loop.

2. **Explore Neighbors:**
   - For each node dequeued, check all its neighbors.
   - If the target (3,3) is reached among these neighbors, the path found can be traced back to the origin using a predecessor map (a map storing each nodeâ€™s preceding node on the path of traversal).

3. **Trace Back Path:**
   - Once the target is found, trace back from the target node to the origin node using the predecessor map, yielding the path followed to reach the end.

4. **Output the Path:**
   - List coordinates as pairs in a sequence representing the path from start to end point.

Given the adjacency list, if we were to apply the BFS approach correctly with keeping track of nodes:
- We can convert adjacency list into a graph map structure for better complexity management during traversal.
- Implementing BFS to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) and using a map to keep track of traversed nodes.

After executing the described plan with BFS:

**Found Path from BFS Traversal could be:**
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

This sequence should ideally be one of the shortest paths from origin to target based on the adjacency list provided.

**Final Solution:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path connects the start to the end through connected nodes as described in the adjacency list, ensuring each step is linked to a direct neighbor either horizontally or vertically.
