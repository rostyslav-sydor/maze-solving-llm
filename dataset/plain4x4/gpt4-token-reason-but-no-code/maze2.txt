Based on the adjacency list provided in the maze query, we have a defined graph of node connections across potentially a 4x4 grid (since we have coordinates flexing from (0,0) to (3,3)). Using the entry point (0,0) and the exit point (3,3), the key to solving this maze is to trace a path through the connected coordinates, ensuring each coordinate moves us closer to our target.

Analyzing the maze paths briefly:
- Starting at (0,0), we have options to move to (0,1) and (1,0).
- Navigation choices are directional based upon where connected nodes exist.

To deduce the pathway:
1. Start at the origin (0,0). From (0,0) we can go to (0,1) or (1,0).
2. Go to (0,1), from (0,1) the next node connected is (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (1,2) to leverage the vertical dimension towards the target.
4. Progress from (1,2) to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), we see connections to (0,3), (2,3), but moving to (2,3) gets us closer on a vertical line towards the goal.
6. From (2,3), go to (2,2).
7. Now from (2,2) move straight down the line to (3,2).
8. Finally, from (3,2) move to (3,3), which is the destination or exit point.

This path resolution uses straightforward steps, exploiting direct adjacency while aiming to maintain a route as centered and as direct towards the target (3,3) as possible based on available connections.

Hence, the path solution from the entrance at (0,0) to the exit at (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path was chosen by navigating through the maze in the most direct and connected way that aligns vertically and horizontally closer to the target in each step.
