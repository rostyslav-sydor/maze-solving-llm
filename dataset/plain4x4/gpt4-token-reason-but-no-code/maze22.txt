To solve the maze described as an adjacency list, we must find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). The maze's connections between cells are bidirectional, as indicated by "<-->". 

One approach to solving mazes is by using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how BFS works:

1. Start from the origin node.
2. Explore all neighbors of the current node.
3. For each neighbor, mark it as visited and add it to the queue if it hasn't been visited.
4. Move to the next node in the queue and repeat the process.
5. Continue until the target node is reached or all possible paths are explored.

Using the BFS for the maze:
- Start at (0,0).
- From (0,0), the next reachable cell is (0,1).
- Then from (0,1), go to (0,2).
- Continue from (0,2) to (1,2).
- From (1,2) to (1,3).
- From (1,3), go to (2,3).
- Finally, from (2,3) move to the exit at (3,3).

Throughout the process, every explored node keeps track of its predecessor. Using this backtracking, you derive the exact path from origin to destination once the destination is reached.

For the specific maze provided, analyzing the adjacency list for the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) and following the BFS steps, the shortest route is plotted as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is deduced by marking nodes, exploring all accessible nodes in succession, and backtracking to define the route.
