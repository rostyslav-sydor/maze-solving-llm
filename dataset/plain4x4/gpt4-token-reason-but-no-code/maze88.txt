To find the solution for the given maze represented by an adjacency list, we need to first construct or understand the maze structure based on the adjacencies provided, determine the entry and exit points, and then use a search algorithm to find the path from the entry to the exit.

### Maze Construction
The maze is constructed using the coordinates provided in the adjacency list. Each line like `(X1,Y1) <--> (X2,Y2)` describes that there is a direct path between cell `(X1,Y1)` and cell `(X2,Y2)`. Based on this, we can visualize the maze as a grid of cells where direct paths are possible between listed coordinates.

### Entry and Exit Points
- Entry point (Origin): `(0,0)`
- Exit point (Target): `(3,3)`

### Path Finding
A suitable method for finding a path in the maze could be using a Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or another graph traversal algorithm that can systematically explore the maze. BFS is often chosen for such tasks as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.

### Application of BFS
By applying BFS:
1. Start from the entry point `(0,0)`.
2. Explore all neighboring cells as per adjacency list.
3. Move to each accessible cell, mark it as visited, and store its parent for later reconstruction of the path.
4. Continue this process until the exit point `(3,3)` is reached.
5. Retrace from the exit point to the entry point using the parent links to form the path.

### Specific Path Construction
Given the paths in the adjacency list:
- Starting from `(0,0)`, possible paths are to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, move to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, move through `(2,1)` to `(2,0)`.
- Head into `(3,0)`, then to `(3,1)`.
- Proceed to `(3,2)` and finally reach `(3,3)`.

So the specific solution to solve this maze based on the given adjacency list and entry/exist points:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence ensures that only valid moves from the adjacency list are included and that every step directly connects to the subsequent step without deviations, ensuring a solution that adheres to the maze's constraints given by the adjacency list.
