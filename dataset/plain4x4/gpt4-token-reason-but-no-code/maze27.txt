To solve the maze defined by the adjacency list, we'll first convert the adjacency pairings into a map that visually represents the linked nodes (coordinates in the maze). Each node corresponds to a coordinate, and a connection between two nodes signifies that one can move between these coordinates without encountering a barrier. The task is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Breakdown of the adjacency list pairs:**
  - (1,2) <--> (2,2) 
  - (3,3) <--> (2,3)
  - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
  - (1,3) <--> (1,2)
  - (2,0) <--> (3,0)
  - (3,2) <--> (2,2) 
  - (2,3) <--> (1,3) 
  - (3,1) <--> (3,2)
  - (0,1) <--> (0,2)
  - (3,1) <--> (2,1)
  - (1,3) <--> (0,3)
  - (1,0) <--> (2,0)
  - (1,1) <--> (0,1)
  - (3,0) <--> (3,1)
  - (2,1) <--> (1,1)

**Structure the graph:**
From the above list, you can deduce the adjacent possible moves from any given point. The graph allows movements along rows and columns provided there is a direct adjacency link.

### Example reasoning for solving the maze:

1. Start from `(0,0)` (origin). Its direct links are to `(1,0)`.
2. From `(1,0)`, possible paths are `(2,0)` and `(0,0)` (backwards is not ideal).
3. From `(2,0)`, move forward to `(3,0)`.
4. From `(3,0)`, step to `(3,1)`.
5. From `(3,1)`, you can move to `(3,2)` or `(2,1)`.
6. From `(3,2)`, direct path leads to `(2,2)` or `(3,3)`.
7. Choose `(3,3)`, since itâ€™s the target.

After each move, always check if the target is reached, and choose paths that move closer to the target. This strategy doesn't require backtracking due to the ample direct connections reducing ambiguity in the route choice.

### Specific solution to the maze:
From the analysis and breakdown above, here is a direct path following the adjacency list's connections:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path efficiently moves from the origin to the target using the available connections, ensuring each step progresses further toward the destination without any reversals or loops.
