The maze provided is in the form of an adjacency list which indicates pairs of connected cells. To solve the maze, one must find a path from the entrance cell to the exit cell. Here is the reasoning:

Given adjacency pairs suggest a grid without explicit cell walls but rather implicit connectivity. The pairs determine where movement between cells is possible.

Our task is to identify a sequence of movements through connected cells from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

**Procedure for Solution:**
1. Analyze and organize provided adjacency list into an easily traversable format. By mapping each cell to its directly reachable neighbors, we transform the adjacency list into a graph structure.
2. Implement a path-finding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted setting like this one where each step from one cell to an adjacent cell has equal cost.
3. Begin the BFS from the origin node `(0,0)`, exploring systematically through its neighbors and then neighbors' neighbors, marking each visited node and extracting paths, until the target `(3,3)` is reached. Arrays or queues can be used for maintaining the nodes to visit next, while also using a map or dictionary to track the origins (predecessors) of each visited node for recovering the path once destination is found.

**Specific Steps for the Given Maze:**
- Using BFS starting at `(0,0)`: Navigate through connections, exploring each accessible adjacent node, and marking each node upon visiting to avoid revisiting it. 
- Track node predecessors to construct the path once the exit `(3,3)` is reached.

By applying BFS to our specific adjacency list and goal:

Start from `(0,0)`:
- Move to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, can move to `(0,2)`.
- Then from `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`.
- From `(0,3)`, move to `(1,3)`.
- Move from `(1,3)` to `(2,3)`.
- Finally, from `(2,3)`, move to `(3,3)`.

This process identifies the sequence of moves from origin to destination without visiting unnecessary cells, ensuring the path is optimal.

**Answer:** 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence accurately traverses the maze based on the connections specified in the adjacency list and leads directly from the origin `(0,0)` to the exit `(3,3)`.
