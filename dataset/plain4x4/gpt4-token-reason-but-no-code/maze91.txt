To solve the maze described in the adjacency list and find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), we need to interpret the adjacency list and deduce a walkable path through the graph represented by the list.

Given the adjacency pairs:
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)

We start at point (0,0). By examining the adjacency list, we can trace out possible routes from the origin to the target:

1. Start at (0,0). 
2. Move to (0,1) based on adjacency (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. From (0,1), continue to (1,1) because (1,1) <--> (0,1) exists.
4. Move from (1,1) to (1,0) since (1,1) <--> (1,0) is an option, but it's a dead end for moving towards (3,3). So, move to (1,2) instead, connected by (1,1) to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), we can move to (2,2) by using the better path (2,2) <--> (1,2).
6. Move from (2,2) to (3,2) using (3,2) <--> (2,2).
7. Now at (3,2), progress to (3,3) via (3,3) <--> (2,3) after moving to (2,3) from (3,2).

This navigation utilizes the maze's adjacency list to ensure each movement between points is valid. Let's represent this path in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route captures a valid path solution through the maze from the entry to the exit.
