To discern a viable path in the maze starting from (0,0) and intended to conclude at (3,3), the first step is to examine the adjacency list which represents all possible direct movements between the coordinates. Every pair in the list represents a bidirectional possibility between contiguous nodes (or cells) in the maze. Thus, every direction, left, right, up, or down availability can be determined from this list, without isolated detours (nonexistent passages).

By utilizing a straightforward traversal approach such as a breadth-first search (BFS), this could efficiently find the shortest path in the maze. BFS is chosen particularly for unweighted grids like this because it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, this practice ensures the shortest path in an unweighted scenario like our maze where each move is equidistant.

In the BFS, each cell is enqueued with reference to its predecessor so when we reach the target (3,3), we can easily backtrack our path from the end to the origin. This process involves:

1. Initializing the queue with the origin node and marking it as visited.
2. Iteratively explore all adjacent cells (as per adjacency list) of the dequeued cell which haven’t been visited yet and enqueue them, marking them as visited, along with keeping a track of their predecessors.
3. Check each time if the dequeued cell is the destination; if yes, stop further exploration.
4. Once destination is reached, backtrack from the destination node to origin node using predecessors to derive the path.

Here is a step-by-step solution using the adjacency list given:

From the adjacency list:
- Start from (0,0).
- Initially, the only option is to go to (0,1) as per the adjacency: (0,1) <--> (0,0).
- Continuing the BFS traversal: from (0,1), the admissible moves lead to (0,0) or (0,2); (0,2) allows to explore new nodes.
- So, proceed to (0,2), following which allows us to move to (1,2) (another progression route toward destination).
- (1,2) leads next to possible nodes (0,2) or (1,3), aiming closer toward (3,3), thus move to (1,3).
- From (1,3) you can progress to (2,3).
- Finally, from (2,3) the way to (3,3) becomes clear, completing the path’s navigation to the destination.

Thus, synthesizing the above steps, the puzzle’s solution is determined as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence is efficient and concise, setting up the shortest route provided with the stated adjacency limitations.
