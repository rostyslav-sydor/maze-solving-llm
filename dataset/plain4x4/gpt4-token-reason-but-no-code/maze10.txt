In the problem, a maze is presented as an adjacency list where each pair of coordinates represents two nodes (cells) connected directly by a path. The goal is to find a route from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). Using the adjacency relations defined, we can outline the ways through which we can travel between these critical points.

To find a solution:
1. Start from the origin, noted as (0,0).
2. Look at direct neighbors in the adjacency list which are (1,0) as indicated by the adjacency of (0,0) <--> (1,0).

3. From (1,0), follow to (2,0) given by the adjacency (1,0) <--> (2,0).

4. From (2,0), one can proceed to (2,1) or (3,0). 
   - We choose (3,0) as it's on the dimension closer to our target of (3,3) as per adjacency (2,0) <--> (3,0).
   
5. Progress from (3,0) to (3,1), next to (3,2), following the path (3,0) <--> (3,1) and (3,1) <--> (3,2).

6. Finally, go from (3,2) to (3,3) facilitated by the adjacency (3,2) <--> (3,3).

Now, compiling all these steps, we get the following path:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0)
- Then to (2,0)
- Continue to (3,0)
- Go upwards to (3,1)
- Then to (3,2)
- Finally, reach the target at (3,3)

As every step is directly connecting to the next based on the adjacency list and moving strategically towards getting closer to our target, this provides a valid solution. Therefore, we demonstrably followed a feasible path according to the adjacency conditions stipulated. Accordingly, the path is listed below.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
