To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we need to traverse the graph using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable here since it explores all possible paths layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found if it exists. In this case:

1. **Start at (0,0)** - Begin from the origin.
2. **Explore Neighbors** - Check for direct connections from the current node (start from (0,0)).
3. **Queue Management** - Use a queue to manage nodes to be explored and a set or dictionary to keep track of visited nodes.
4. **Path Reconstruction** - Upon reaching the target node, backtrack to reconstruct the path from end to start by keeping track of how we reached each node.

Based on the adjacency list given:
- From (0,0) we can move to (0,1).
- From (0,1) we can move next to (0,2).
- From (0,2), the connections lead to both (0,3) and (1,2).
- Continue exploring connected nodes in similar fashion until the target (3,3) is reached.

Following the logic of BFS for exploring nodes and finding a path, here's the specific solution for the given maze expressed as a list of coordinates marking the path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence is based on a step-by-step progression from the start to the end, ensuring that each step is legitimized by the given set of connections in the adjacency list. It uses efficiently the BFS properties reaching the target (3,3) from the origin (0,0) through allowable paths.
