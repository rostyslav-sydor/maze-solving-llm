To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3). The adjacency list defines the connections between each set of coordinates in the maze, indicating where one can travel from any given point.

Let's break down the adjacency list and use it to track possible paths from the origin to the target:

1. Start at the origin (0,0). From (0,0), we can travel to (0,1).
2. From (0,1): Travel to (0,2).
3. From (0,2): There are connections to (0,1) and (0,3).
4. From (0,3): Connections to (1,3) and back to (0,2).
5. From (1,3): Connections to (1,2) and (2,3).
6. Choose (2,3): Connects to (2,2).
7. From (2,2): Continue to (3,2).
8. From (3,2): There's an available path to (3,3), our target.

By following these points, we can establish a path from the origin to the destination. Therefore, the solution to this specific maze, formatted as specified, would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path is derived based on the adjacency connections given, ensuring each move is valid according to the maze's definition. Each step progresses towards the target, making sure to leverage the shortest route based on the available direct connections between coordinates.
