To solve this maze, we can use a graph search algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS), which efficiently finds the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph. Since the representation of this maze is provided as an adjacency list, BFS can proceed by exploring each node and its neighbors iteratively, starting from the origin until we reach the target.

The maze is defined with these connections:
- Nodes indicating coordinates are connected as neighbors if there's a direct path between them.

From the adjacency list:
```
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,1) <--> (2,1)
(1,3) <--> (1,2)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
```

The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).

Using BFS:
1. Start at (0,0) and look at its neighbors. According to the list, (0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0).
2. At each step, explore the neighboring nodes. For example, from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3).
3. Continue BFS, expanding outward from each node, capturing the visited nodes and their paths until reaching the target (3,3).

Following this procedure for this specific maze:
- From (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (0,2)
- From (0,2) to (0,3)
- From (0,3) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (2,3)
- From (2,3) to (3,3)

Thus, the earliest and shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the given connections in the adjacency list is a straight line snaking down from the top left to the bottom right, moving horizontally first and then descending vertically.

Therefore, the solution in the required format:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
