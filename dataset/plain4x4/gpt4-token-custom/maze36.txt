To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, we start by interpreting the graph representation. We need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency pairs listed.

First, let's reconstruct the adjacency relationships into a more visual map format (if we were to draw it out):

1. Create connections as per adjacency list:
   - Each pair such as (x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2) indicates a direct path between these two coordinates.
2. Clearly note the origin (0,0) and target (3,3) points as the start and end of our required path.

Starting at (0,0), and identifying paths leading out:
- **From (0,0)**, we can reach (0,1)
- **From (0,1)**, it connects to both (0,0) and (0,2)
- **From (0,2)**, the paths lead to both (0,1) and (0,3) and (1,2)
- Proceeding to **(0,3)**, we can move to (1,3)
- Going **from (1,3)**, choices are (0,3) and (2,3)
- From **(2,3)**, the path can lead directly to the target location (3,3)

Assembling these steps into a path to get from (0,0) to (3,3), the route is:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move straight vertically to (0,1)
3. Continue to (0,2)
4. Progress to (0,3)
5. Move right, vertical step up to (1,3)
6. Another vertical step up to (2,3)
7. Finally one more vertical move to (3,3), i.e., the target.

Thus, using only adjacent cells as required, we stay consistent with the adjacency list provided and form a valid path from origin to target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path maintains adjacency as per the list without crossing walls, ensuring valid navigation through the maze according to the graph description. Each coordinate in the path connects directly to the next in the list, forming a clearly navigable route.
