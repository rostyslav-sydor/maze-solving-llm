<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

First, I extracted the maze's structure presented between the <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens and formatted them into an adjacency list format to help visualize potential paths.

The maze's entry and exit points were indicated clearly between the <ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END> tokens. (0,0) was identified as the entry point and (3,3) as the exit point.

To map a path through the maze:
1. Starting at (0,0), the adjacency list showed that this cell is connected to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the adjacent cell is (0,2).
3. Continuing the same approach from (0,2), the next cell is (0,3).
4. From (0,3), the path can proceed to (1,3).
5. After reaching (1,3), the adjacent cells are (2,3).
6. Moving forward from (2,3) allows a direct movement to (3,3).
   
Each step followed here utilized direct connections specified in the adjacency list ensuring that no cell is skipped or revisited unnecessarily, and the path solely consists of adjacent cells as outlined. All transitions between cells in the path have corresponding adjacency relations as defined, confirming that no walls are crossed and the path is valid.
