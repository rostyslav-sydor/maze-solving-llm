<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning and Validation:**
1. Starting at the origin point (0,0), the next adjacent cell in the adjacency list is (1,0), establishing our first move.
2. From (1,0), moving to (2,0) is valid as per the given connections.
3. Next, from (2,0) the natural path to keep progressing towards the exit at (3,3) is progressing to (3,0), according to the maze paths provided.
4. From (3,0), there are connections to (3,1), then from (3,1) the path progresses directly to (3,2) and finally to the target (3,3).

**Validation**:
- Each step moves to an adjacent cell that is directly connected in the provided list, ensuring no walls are being crossed.
- The path travels only through directly linked cells, making it a valid solution for the provided maze structure.
