<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. **Starting Point:** The maze starts at (0,0) and the target is (3,3).

2. **Movement Strategy:** Aim to move as directly as possible to the target while remaining within the given connections (adjacency list).
   
3. **Navigating through (0,0) to (3,3):**
   - Start at (0,0); to progress toward the row index of the target, first move horizontally (keeping the row constant) and then vertically (keeping the column constant).
   - From (0,0), move to (0,1). The adjacency list confirms that (0,0) is connected to (0,1).
   - Next, from (0,1), move to (0,2). The adjacency list includes (0,2) <--> (0,1), validating this move.
   - Proceed from (0,2) to (0,3). The adjacency list shows (1,3) <--> (0,3), validating the connectivity from (0,3).
   - Now, shift vertically towards the target: move from (0,3) to (1,3). As mentioned in the previous step, (1,3) <--> (0,3) connection exists.
   - Continue from (1,3) to (2,3). The adjacency list has (1,3) <--> (2,3) recorded.
   - Finally, move from (2,3) to the destination (3,3). This is directly connected as per (3,3) <--> (2,3) in the adjacency list.

4. **Validation against possible walls and regions of non-accessibility:**
   - Each step of the path only uses nodes connected in the adjacency list.
   - No zigzag or detours that aren't represented in the provided connections.
   - Hence, each move adheres strictly to the available paths as described in the adjacency list.

5. **End Check:** This path completes with only adjacent cells being used step-by-step, matching the connections from the adjacency list without any crossings or detours outside of the defined paths.
