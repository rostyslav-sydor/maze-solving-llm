To solve the maze, we need to identify a proper path that connects the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the given adjacency list that represents possible movements between connected cells.

1. From the adjacency list, we pick the starting point (0,0).
2. Our target is the point (3,3).
3. Each pair in the adjacency list represents a direct, bidirectional connection (you can move back and forth between these cells).

Starting at (0,0), according to the adjacency list:
- From (0,0), we can move to (1,0) and (0,1).

Checking possible pathways:
- **Moving to (1,0)**: From (1,0), we can subsequently move to (2,0). From (2,0), progress to (2,1) and then to (1,1). From (1,1), two connections are (1,2) and back to (2,1). Choose (1,2) as it brings us closer to the target. From (1,2) to (1,3) and from there to either (0,3) or (2,3). Proceed to (2,3) as its direct connections include the destination (3,3). From (2,3), directly go to (3,3).

Therefore, path found:
- **<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>**

- **Moving to (0,1)** will lead us sequentially through the following points: (0,1) to (0,2). From (0,2), move to (1,2), then to (1,3), proceed to (0,3) and then to (1,3) onward to (2,3). From (2,3), we can reach to (3,3).

This alternative path:
- **<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>**

Both paths are valid, maintaining adjacency at each step and not crossing any walls. Checking the adjacency list verifies all moves use only the listed connections, thus both solutions do not violate any constraints. I will finalize the decision by choosing the first pathway, as the steps are more straightforward and involve fewer redundant moves (like moving back and forth between coordinates).

Final chosen path:
- **<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>**
