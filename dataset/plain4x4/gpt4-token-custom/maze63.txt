<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind the Path:**
1. Starting from the origin (0,0), the direct neighbors given in the adjacency list are only (0,1).
2. From (0,1) the neighboring cells in the adjacency list are (0,0) and (0,2).
3. Moving forward to (0,2), the next adjacent cells are (0,1) and (0,3). We continue rightward to (0,3).
4. At (0,3), the potential paths are back to (0,2) or to (1,3). I chose to progress downward to (1,3).
5. Examining (1,3), neighbors are (0,3) and (2,3), hence moving further downward to reach (2,3).
6. At (2,3), the adjacent cells are (1,3) and (3,3).
7. Moving directly downward from (2,3) leads to the target (3,3).

**Validation of path according to adjacency relations:**
- Each step in the selected path adheres to the adjacency relations specified in the list. 
- The path does not cross any unspecified connections between cells.
- All movements are to adjacent cells; therefore, there is no jumping or diagonal movement that would imply crossing a wall.

By adhering to the adjacency list provided and the restrictions mentioned, this path offers a valid solution to traverse from the maze's entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).
