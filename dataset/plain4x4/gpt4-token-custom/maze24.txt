To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, follow these steps:

1. **Conversion of Adjacency List into Maze Structure**: Convert the adjacency tokens into a usable format, parsing tokens to determine which cells are directly connected.

2. **Finding Start and End Points**: Identify the origin `(0,0)` and target `(3,3)` using the provided origin and target tokens.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**: Utilize BFS to explore the maze systematically. BFS is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (or maze), ensuring every node is only explored once.

4. **Maintaining the Path**: To reconstruct the path after BFS reaches the destination, use a predecessor or parent array that records the preceding node on the shortest path back to the source. 

5. **List Generation for Output**:
   - Once BFS completes, backtrack from the target using the predecessor array to the start to form the path.
   - Convert this path into the desired output format of coordinate list.

Verification involves:
- Ensuring every step from one coordinate to the next is legitimate by referring to the adjacency list (no jumping across non-connected nodes).
- Checking that the path begins at `(0, 0)` and correctly ends at `(3, 3)`.
- Verifying all nodes or coordinates are adjacent as per the adjacency list.

Here is the solution based on the adjacency list presented, the starting point `(0,0)`, and the ending point `(3,3)`:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Check**:
1. **Direct Paths in Adjacency List**:
    - From `(0,0)` to `(1,0)`
    - From `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`
    - From `(2,0)` to `(3,0)`
    - From `(3,0)` to `(3,1)`
    - From `(3,1)` to `(3,2)`
    - From `(3,2)` to `(3,3)`

2. **All Movements are Between Adjacent Cells**: As checked, all steps in the path directly move between adjacent nodes as defined in the adjacency list. No coordinate skips over non-connected nodes.

3. **Starts and Ends Correctly**: Begins at `(0,0)` and concludes at `(3,3)`, consistent with the origin and target criteria. 

This path effectively uses the given adjacency list, respects the adjacency rules without crossing any unmapped connections, and proceeds from the defined start to the end coordinates directly, ensuring the solutionâ€™s validity.
