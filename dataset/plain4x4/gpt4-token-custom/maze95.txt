First, I'll closely analyze the adjacency list provided for the maze to understand the possible routes between cells in the graph. I will then determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Based on the adjacency list, here are the connections between cells:
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)

Starting from the origin (0,0), we need to find a path towards (3,3) without breaking any wall constraints or revisiting cells to ensure the shortest possible route:
1. Start at (0,0), then move to (0,1) through the connection (0,1) <--> (0,0).
2. Move from (0,1) to (0,2) using (0,2) <--> (0,1).
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3) via (0,3) <--> (0,2).
4. From (0,3), go to (1,3) using (0,3) <--> (1,3).
5. Move from (1,3) to (2,3) using (2,3) <--> (1,3).
6. Use connection (2,3) <--> (3,3) to move from (2,3) to (3,3).

This pathway follows the adjacency list line by line, without breaking any walls, and using only adjacent connections provided:

- (0,0) to (0,1)
- (0,1) to (0,2)
- (0,2) to (0,3)
- (0,3) to (1,3)
- (1,3) to (2,3)
- (2,3) to (3,3)

The path winds its way up through the maze, travels across the third row, and ends up at the target cell, thus providing a valid exit pathway. This path adheres to the rules of only traversing through connected cells without any retrace of steps or crossing of non-connected points.

Thus, the path from the starting cell (0,0) to the target cell (3,3) is represented as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
