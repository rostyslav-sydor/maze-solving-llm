To find the solution for the given maze represented as an adjacency list, we will consider each connection within the adjacency list as the possible paths or hallways in the maze that can be traversed.

**Maze Adjacency List:**
- The adjacency list details connections like (0,3) <--> (1,3); (3,2) <--> (3,1); etc., indicating which cells in the maze are directly connected.

**Entry and Exit:**
- Entry is defined as (0,0)
- Exit is defined as (3,3)

**Procedure:**
1. Start at the entry point (0,0).
2. Identify all directly connected, accessible cells from the current position using the adjacency list.
3. Apply a pathfinding algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to determine the shortest path from the starting cell to the target cell, using the connections provided in the adjacency list.

**Pathfinding:**
1. Starting at (0,0), the adjacency list shows a connection to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2) since (0,1) <--> (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (0,3) as (0,2) <--> (0,3).
4. From (0,3), proceed to (1,3) because of the relationship (0,3) <--> (1,3).
5. From (1,3), transition next to (2,3) as specified by (1,3) <--> (2,3).
6. Finally, from (2,3), move to (3,3), following the connection (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Thus, the path from the entry to the exit, obeying the adjacency and not crossing unlisted connections, comprises:
- Starting at (0,0) to (0,1)
- Then (0,1) to (0,2)
- Then (0,2) to (0,3)
- Then (0,3) to (1,3)
- Then (1,3) to (2,3)
- Finally, (2,3) to (3,3)

**Verification:**
The path described only uses adjacent cells with direct connections, as specified in the adjacency list. There are no skipped coordinates, and each cell transition is valid per the adjacency list, making it a feasible solution to traverse the maze.

The path output is displayed as below:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This concise output follows the required format, showing a clear and navigable route through the maze from entrance to exit.
