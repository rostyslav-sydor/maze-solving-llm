To solve the maze, we need to determine the shortest path using the given adjacency list from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

Starting with the entries within the adjacency list:
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

By tracing the path through accessible points, we transition from (0,0) to (3,3) directly by following the connected cells in the adjacency list.

Now let's confirm the path step-by-step:
1. Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) - valid as directly connected.
2. From (1,0) move to (2,0) - valid as directly connected.
3. From (2,0) move to (3,0) - valid as directly connected.
4. From (3,0) move to (3,1) - valid as directly connected.
5. From (3,1) move to (3,2) - valid as directly connected.
6. From (3,2) move to (3,3) - valid as directly connected.

Every step meets the adjacency requirement without crossing any walls, and since adjacent blocks are allowed, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) is indeed optimal and valid.

Hence, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
