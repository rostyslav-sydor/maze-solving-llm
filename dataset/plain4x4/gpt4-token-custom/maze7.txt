To solve the maze problem, I followed the below steps:

1. **Representation of the Maze as a Graph**: The adjacency list represents the connections (edges) between each cell (vertex) in the graph. Each pair (like (1,3) <--> (1,2)) indicates a direct pathway between the two cells, meaning one can move directly from one to the other.

2. **Entry and Exit Points**: With entry as (0,0) and exit as (3,3), the task is to find a path from the entry to the exit.

3. **Finding the Path**:
   - I started at the entry point (0,0) and looked for adjacent points in the adjacency list.
   - Continued to pick vertices ensuring continuity from the current vertex while avoiding previously visited vertices to prevent loops.
   - Kept tracing the path till reaching the endpoint (3,3).

**Path Traced**:
- Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1) which is connected (0,1) <--> (0,0).
- Then move to (0,2), connected through (0,2) <--> (0,1).
- From (0,2) to (1,2), which is connected through (0,2) <--> (1,2).
- From (1,2) to (1,3), move using the edge (1,3) <--> (1,2).
- From (1,3) to (2,3), move via (1,3) <--> (2,3).
- Finally, from (2,3) to (3,3) using the edge (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Now printing the solution path while making sure each step follows only from the given edges:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Validation**:
- Each coordinate change between cells in the path should have a corresponding connection in the adjacency list.
- This specific path does not cross any walls since every transition between coordinates has been verified against available connections in the adjacency list.
- Each cell move is to an adjacent cell in either column or row but not diagonally, adhering to valid adjacency.

Thus, the solution path provided navigates through the maze using valid passages and correctly leads from the start to the finish without retracing steps, ensuring it adheres to the mazeâ€™s adjacency definitions.
