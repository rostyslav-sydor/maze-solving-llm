To solve this maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I implemented graph traversal using breadth-first search (BFS), taking advantage of the given adjacency list:

The adjacency list provided is as follows:
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)

Starting with (0,0):
1. From (0,0), the only move is to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), progress to (2,2).
5. Then, from (2,2), move to (2,3).
6. Continuing from (2,3), move to (3,3).

Thus, the coordinates of the path are:
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Inspecting the path:
Visiting each subsequent node confirms that every move is connected directly as mentioned in the adjacency list and adjusts properly to the adjacent path. Hence, the path from start (0,0) to the end (3,3) can be verified as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path travels through passable connections, ensuring no walls are crossed and all moves are to adjacent cells.
