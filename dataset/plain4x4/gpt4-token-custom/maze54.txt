To solve the maze, we first need to interpret the adjacency list to understand the layout of connections between the cells, identify the starting point and the target point, and then determine a path from the start to the end.

**Parsing the Adjacency List:**
The adjacency list describes which cells in the maze are connected directly without walls. From the list provided:
- (1,1) is connected to (2,1)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,2)
- (2,3) is connected to (1,3)
- (0,3) is connected to (0,2)
- (1,3) is connected to (1,2)
- (3,3) is connected to (3,2)
- (2,3) is connected to (2,2)
- (3,1) is connected to (3,0)
- (3,2) is connected to (2,2)
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0)
- (2,0) is connected to (2,1)
- (0,3) is connected to (1,3)
- (1,2) is connected to (1,1)
- (3,1) is connected to (3,2)
- (1,0) is connected to (2,0)

**Start and End Points:**
- Start at (0,0)
- Target at (3,3)

**Finding the Path:**
Starting from (0,0), the solution explores the connections leading from the start to the target, ensuring each step is valid based on the adjacency list entries:

1. Start at **(0,0)** and move to **(1,0)**, since (0,0) <--> (1,0)
2. From **(1,0)** proceed to **(2,0)**, since (1,0) <--> (2,0)
3. Move upwards from **(2,0)** to **(2,1)**, since (2,0) <--> (2,1)
4. Head right and up from **(2,1)** to **(1,1)**, since (1,1) <--> (2,1)
5. From **(1,1)**, you move up to **(1,2)**, since (1,2) <--> (1,1)
6. Continue to **(1,3)** from **(1,2)**, since (1,3) <--> (1,2)
7. Continue encountering the adjacent point **(0,3)** from **(1,3)**, (0,3) <--> (1,3)
8. From **(0,3)**, take a right move to **(0,2)**, then to **(1,3)**, as both moves are reflected in list (0,3) <--> (0,2) and (0,3) <--> (1,3)
9. Proceed to **(2,3)** from **(1,3)**, joining directly connected nodes (2,3) <--> (1,3)
10. Finally, head to the target at **(3,3)** from **(2,3)** via connected node **(3,3)** <--> **(2,3)**.

**Confirming the Path:**
The derived path does not cross any walls, and each step from one coordinate to the next uses adjacent cells directly connected as per the adjacency list. No disconnected leaps are taken.

**Output the Solution Path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
