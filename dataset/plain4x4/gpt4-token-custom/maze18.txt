To solve the maze, we will follow these steps:

1. **Interpret the Representation:** The adjacency list presents a graph where each unique pair of coordinates represents an open pathway between two cells. Each cell is represented as `(row, column)` and each connection `<-->` represents a traversable path between adjacent cells in the maze.

2. **Determine the Origin and Target:** From the tokens `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>` and `<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>`, we identify `(0,0)` as the starting point and `(3,3)` as the exit.

3. **Construct a Graph:** Convert the adjacency list into a structured graph representation using a dictionary where keys are cell coordinates and values are a list of adjacent cells:
    ```plaintext
    Graph:
    {
        (0, 0): [(1, 0)],
        (1, 0): [(0, 0), (2, 0)],
        (2, 0): [(1, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1)],
        (3, 0): [(3, 1), (2, 0)],
        (1, 2): [(1, 1), (1, 3)],
        (1, 3): [(2, 3), (1, 2), (0, 3)],
        (0, 3): [(0, 2), (1, 3)],
        (0, 2): [(0, 3)],
        ...
    }
    ```

4. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Path Finding:** We implement BFS starting from `(0,0)`. This approach explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. The strategy helps to ensure the shortest path is found.

5. **Detail of BFS Execution:**
    - Start at `(0,0)`, explore all adjacent cells. Only `(1, 0)` is accessible.
    - From `(1, 0)`, explore `(0, 0)` (already visited) and `(2, 0)`.
    - Continue exploring outward, ensuring you do not revisit nodes. Maintain a record of the path taken to reach each node for path reconstruction.

6. **Check for Path Validity:** Once the BFS locates the target `(3,3)`, reconstruct the path by tracing back from the target to the origin. Confirm each step in the path by checking if subsequent steps are listed as adjacent in the graph.

7. **Create the Output Path:** Using the reconstructed path, frame it as per the needed format with the precise cell coordinates in the correct sequence.

By following these outlined steps, the solution ensures that the maze is navigated efficiently, adhering to all constraints given by the adjacency list, and reaches (3,3) from (0,0). 

Here's the solution based on the above:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path logically follows from the BFS traversal, avoiding any backtracking or invalid routes. It also ensures each step is to an adjacent cell, adhering to the maze's connectivity rules provided in the adjacency list. Each step pairs found in the list reflect the direct connection required by the path validation.
