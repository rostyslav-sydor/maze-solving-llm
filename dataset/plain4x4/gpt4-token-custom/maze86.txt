<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning and Validation:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0), which is given as the entry point.
2. Move to (0,1) - From the adjacency list, we notice that (0,1) connects to (0,0).
3. Next, move to (0,2) - Connected directly to (0,1).
4. Progress to (1,2) - This node connects directly with (0,2).
5. Move to (2,2) - This node connects directly with (1,2).
6. Move to (2,3) - This node connects directly with (2,2).
7. Finally, end at (3,3), the exit point - This connects directly to (2,3).

In this pathway:
- Each move involves moving to only adjacent cells as described by the adjacency list provided.
- There are no walls crossed, since every coordinate in the path connects to the subsequent coordinate directly through entries in the adjacency list.
- We are ensuring that every step only goes to nodes that are explicitly listed as connected to our current position in the adjacency list, fulfilling the condition of using only the paths provided.
