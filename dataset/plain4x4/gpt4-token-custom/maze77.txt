Given the maze encoded as an adjacency list, our task is to find a path between the start point `(0,0)` and the end point `(3,3)`. The adjacency list contains direct connections between points in the maze, effectively explaining which points are directly connected without barriers between them.

**Here's how to solve the maze:**

1. Start at the entry point `(0,0)`.
2. Examine the adjacency list to find all neighboring cells directly connected to `(0,0)`. We see that `(0,0)` is connected to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)` from the entries `(1,0) <--> (0,0)` and `(0,0) <--> (0,1)` respectively.
3. Choose either adjacent cell and continue the process to find cells connected to the chosen cell.
4. Use a strategy that ensures you cover new ground and move toward the target. Here, we look for a choice that starts moving either downward or to the right toward `(3,3)`.

Following the explanation above, we trace the path:
- From `(0,0)`, we can move to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, next move to `(0,2)`.
- From `(0,2)`, move to `(1,2)`.
- From `(1,2)`, we can move to `(1,3)`.
- From `(1,3)`, go to `(2,3)`.
- Finally, from `(2,3)` move to `(3,3)`.

This suggested path uses all connections that exist in the adjacency list and progressively moves toward the final destination. 

**Check against adjacency list**:
- (0,0) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)

Each move is a legal move according to the adjacency list, and since each cell movement is only to adjacent cells, no walls are crossed illegally.

**Formatted Output**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path satisfies all the conditions of the problem and offers one way through the maze from the origin to the target.
