To find the solution to this maze represented as an adjacency list, we need to construct the path from the origin (starting point) to the target (exit point) by following the connections provided in the adjacency list.

The adjacency list provides the direct connections between nodes in the maze:
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)

The origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). To solve the maze, I will trace a route through the connected nodes beginning from the origin moving towards the target:

1. Starting at the origin (0,0), the possible move is to (1,0) as per the adjacency (0,0) <--> (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0) [(1,0) <--> (2,0)].
3. From (2,0), move to (3,0) [(3,0) <--> (2,0)].
4. From (3,0), move to (3,1) [(3,0) <--> (3,1)].
5. From (3,1), move to (3,2) [(3,2) <--> (3,1)].
6. From (3,2), move to (3,3) [(3,3) <--> (3,2)].

This sequence connects to the target (3,3) through adjacent nodes defined in the adjacency list. The order of nodes represents a valid path as each pair is directly connected.

Check to verify:
- Each move is between directly connected nodes in the adjacency list (validated by the entries).
- No move crosses walls or uses non-adjacent cells (complies with the adjacency list provided).

Finally, format the path into the requested output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This list successfully navigates from the origin to the target using valid, sequential moves according to the adjacency connections supplied.
