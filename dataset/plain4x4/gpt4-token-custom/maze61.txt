To solve the maze, I'll outline my analysis first and then provide the solution:

1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: The maze is given as an adjacency list where each pairing indicates navigable paths between cells (nodes). The goal is to find a route from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using these paths.

2. **Graph Exploration Technique**: I'll employ Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is ideal for unweighted graphs like this. BFS explores the nearest nodes first and ensures the shortest path in an unweighted scenario.

3. **Breadth-First Search Execution**:
   - Start from the origin `(0,0)`.
   - At each step, explore all neighboring nodes indicated in the adjacency list that haven't been visited yet.
   - Continue until the target `(3,3)` is reached or all possible paths are exhausted.

4. **Verification**:
   - Once a path is found, verify each step to ensure it aligns with the pairs listed in the adjacency list (no crossing through walls).
   - Ensure each step from one cell to the next is to an immediately adjacent cell (either horizontally or vertically).

5. **Path Construction**:
   - As BFS finds the shortest path, I'll sequentially record each node (cell) visited from the origin to the target.

Now, having explained the methodology, the path through the maze from origin `(0,0)` to target `(3,3)` using the adjacency list provided would follow these nodes:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Explanation of Path:
- Starting from `(0,0)`, proceed to `(1,0)`, which directly connects based on the adjacency relationships.
- Continue from `(1,0)` to `(1,1)`, then from `(1,1)` to `(1,2)`, each move utilizing available edges from the list.
- Move from `(1,2)` to `(2,2)`, an adjacent and linked cell.
- Advance next to `(3,2)` from `(2,2)`.
- Finish the path by stepping to `(3,3)` from `(3,2)`.

The chosen path moves systematically through adjacent cells, confirmed by adjacency edges such as `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`, `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`, and so forth, ensuring there is no violation of the maze boundaries or illegal moves. Each step connects a pair of coordinates directly declared as linked in the given list, satisfying the requirements for an acceptable solution.
