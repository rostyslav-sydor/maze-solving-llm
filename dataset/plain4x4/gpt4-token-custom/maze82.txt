<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind Path Selected:**
1. Starting at the entry point (0,0) given by the origin token.
2. Moving from (0,0) to (1,0) as per adjacency in the list.
3. Then moving from (1,0) to (2,0), and onto (3,0) following direct adjacencies in the list.
4. From (3,0), we go to (3,1), then proceed to (3,2), and finally reach (3,3), all directly connected.
5. The path successfully connects the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3) using valid moves as per edges defined in the adjacency list.

**Verification against the walls and adjacency list:**
- Every move is directly supported by an edge listed in the adjacency list, meaning no walls are crossed.
- Each coordinate move progresses to an adjacently connected cell.
- Thus, the selected path uses only valid moves, adheres to the adjacency list, and connects start to target points without errors.
