Let’s analyze the adjacency list provided for the maze.

Here are the connections:
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,1) <--> (3,1)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)

Based on these connections, let's plot the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3). 
I need to ensure there's a connected path from start to finish.

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), go to (0,2).
4. Move upward from (0,2) to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
6. Go from (1,3) to (2,3).
7. Then move from (2,3) directly to the target (3,3).

Each move connects directly to the next based on the adjacency list, fulfilling the rule that each move uses only adjacent cells. Also, there are no crossings through walls as each cell transition is present in the adjacency list. This path is efficient as it takes direct routes with available connections towards the target.

Let’s represent the path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
