In order to solve the given maze, I will do the following:

1. **Parse the adjacency list**: First, extract and interpret the adjacency list added between `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`. This list provides connections between different nodes, where nodes are grid locations like (x, y).

2. **Define start (origin) and end (target) points**: Determine the entry point `(0,0)` listed between `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>`, and the exit point `(3,3)` listed between `<TARGET_START>` and `<TARGET_END>`.

3. **Graph traversal**: Use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to explore paths from the origin to the target. BFS is typically preferred for the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one.

4. **Verify the path**: Ensure that the constructed path only travels between adjacent cells and does not cross any internal "walls" or non-existent edges as per the adjacency list.

Steps followed:

- **Parse the adjacency list**: The adjacency list links are interpreted to generate a graph data structure.
- **Initiate BFS from (0,0)**: Start from `(0,0)` exploring to all connectable nodes. Move along linked nodes while tracking the path.
- **Check arrival at (3,3)**: Continue traversal until `(3,3)` is reached or all possible paths are exhaustively searched.
- **Path validation**: Once a path is found, check its validity by confirming each step is to an adjacent node as per the list.

With this approach in mind, upon applying BFS, one potential solution path from (0,0) to (3,3) based on the adjacency is as follows:
- Starting at (0,0), possible move based on the list is to (0,1).
- Next, from (0,1) move to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move to (0,3).
- Continuing from (0,3), possible move based on the list is to (1,3).
- Next, from (1,3) proceed to (2,3).
- Then, from (2,3) move to (3,3), the exit.

Here is the final solution in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution path follows valid connections from the provided adjacency list, avoiding any walls and using only adjacent nodes. Thus, it validly navigates from entry to exit without intersection with any walls, fulfilling the provided maze challenge criteria.
