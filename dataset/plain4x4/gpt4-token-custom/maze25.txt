To solve the provided maze described by an adjacency list, I begin by identifying the structure of the maze's connections and the defined origin and target points.

**Step 1: Understand the Adjacency List**
The list describes connections between cells in a coordinate grid:
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- ...

**Step 2: Identify the Entry and Exit Points**
- Entry (Origin): (0,0)
- Exit (Target): (3,3)

The task is to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the connections described in the adjacency list.

**Step 3: Mapping the Maze**
I'll conceptualize the maze grid based on provided connections to understand the possible paths. Essentially, I'll map the points into a grid and use a search algorithm to traverse from the start to the target.

**Step 4: Selecting a Pathfinding Algorithm**
Choosing Breadth-First Search (BFS), as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which in this case translates to finding the shortest path in the maze using its connections.

**Step 5: Begin BFS at (0,0)**
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Check connections and proceed to connected nodes, marking as visited.
3. Using the adjacency list: from (0,0) the next cell is (1,0) considering (1,0) <--> (0,0) exists. Keep track of each traversed cell.

**Sequence of BFS Moves:**
- Start at (0,0), go to (1,0)
- From (1,0) to (1,1)
- From (1,1) to (1,2)
- From (1,2) to (2,2)
- From (2,2) to (2,1)
- From (2,1) to (2,0)
- From (2,0) to (3,0)
- From (3,0) to (3,1)
- From (3,1) to (3,2)
- From (3,2) to (3,3), reaching the target.

At every step, each movement is validated by the adjacency list ensuring no walls are crossed and cells are adjacent.

**Step 6: Validate the Path**
Ensure all movements are according to the allowed paths in the adjacency list and by check each transition is legal:
- (0,0) --> (1,0)
- (1,0) --> (1,1)
- ...
- (3,2) --> (3,3), all verified from adjacency data.

**Output:**
The path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only allowed paths from the maze's adjacency list is confirmed, following closely to the BFS sequence without jumping over non-connected cells or bypassing any barriers:

<Path_Start> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_End>
This is a validated BFS-driven path using your maze's adjacency structure and abides by all rules set in the adjacency list and point connections.
