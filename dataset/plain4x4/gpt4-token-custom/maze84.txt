To solve the maze, let's first understand the adjacency list and then derive the shortest path from the start point (origin) to the end point (exit).

From the adjacency list provided:
- The maze's links are:
  (2,1) <-> (3,1)
  (3,1) <-> (3,2)
  (1,2) <-> (2,2)
  (3,3) <-> (3,2)
  (1,1) <-> (1,2)
  (1,0) <-> (0,0)
  (0,2) <-> (0,3)
  (2,3) <-> (1,3)
  (3,3) <-> (2,3)
  (1,3) <-> (1,2)
  (3,0) <-> (3,1)
  (0,1) <-> (0,2)
  (1,0) <-> (2,0)
  (1,1) <-> (0,1)
  (2,0) <-> (2,1)

Next, find a path from start (0,0) to target (3,3):
- The algorithm used here is a breadth-first search (BFS) which is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this adjacency list representation of the maze.
- BFS starts from the starting point, visiting all adjacent points, then goes to points next to those, and so forth, until the target is met.

Here are the BFS steps:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Visit all points reachable in one move:
    - From (0,0), the possible move is to (1,0).
3. Visit all points reachable from (1,0):
    - From (1,0), moves to (0,0) which is back, or (2,0).
4. Visit all vertices from (2,0):
    - Can move to (1,0), back again, or to (2,1).
5. From (2,1), possible moves are:
    - Back to (2,0) or forward to (3,1).
6. From (3,1), moves can be:
    - Back to (2,1) or to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), proceed to (3,3) which is the target.

Based on this, the path calculated is:
- (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3).

Hence, the solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path includes only adjacent cells and respects the walls defined in the maze's adjacency list, providing a valid solution to the maze puzzle.
