<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Explanation:

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1) - possible according to the adjacency pair (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Continue to (0,2) - possible from (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. Move next to (0,3) - possible from (0,3) <--> (0,2).
5. Proceed to (1,3) - it connects from (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6. Proceed to (2,3) - it connects from (2,3) <--> (1,3).
7. Finally, move to the target point (3,3) - it connects from (3,3) <--> (2,3).

This path uses only adjacent cells and does not cross any walls according to the given adjacency lists. All moves comply with the adjacency links provided in the problem statement.
