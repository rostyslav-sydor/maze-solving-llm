To solve the maze, we can interpret it as a graph where each cell (coordinate) is a node and each connection between cells (as given by the adjacency list) is an undirected edge. We will use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find a path from the entry coordinate to the exit coordinate. BFS is suitable as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

From the provided adjacency list:
- (0,0) is directly connected to (0,1).
- (0,1) is connected to both (0,0) and (0,2) and also to (1,1).
- (0,2) connects to (0,1) and (0,3).
- (0,3) connects to (0,2) and (1,3).
- (1,0) connects to (2,0).
- (1,1) connects to (0,1), (1,2).
- (1,2) connects to (1,1) and (2,2).
- (1,3) links to both (0,3) and (2,3).
- (2,0) connects to both (2,1) and (1,0).
- (2,1) links to (2,0) and (3,1).
- (2,2) connects to (1,2).
- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (3,3).
- (3,0) connects to (3,1).
- (3,1) links to (3,0), (3,2), and (2,1).
- (3,2) connects to (3,1) and (3,3).
- (3,3) connects to (2,3) and (3,2).

Using this information, we start at (0,0) and explore all possible paths using BFS. We queue each node's adjacent nodes until we reach (3,3).

Following BFS from (0,0), we get:
1. Start from (0,0), add its neighbor (0,1) to the queue.
2. Visit (0,1), add its unvisited neighbors (0,2) and (1,1).
3. From (0,2) to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3) directly to (3,3).

Summarizing the path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). Each step uses only directly listed connections in the adjacency list, ensuring we don't cross any walls.

Path output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path satisfies all constraints and moves through valid, adjacent cells from the given adjacencies.
