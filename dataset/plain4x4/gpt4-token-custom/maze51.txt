<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. From the origin (0,0), I looked at the adjacent list to determine the valid adjacent cells. 
2. Starting from (0,0), the options are moving to (1,0) or to (0,1). The aim is to get to (3,3), thus moving downwards or rightwards when possible could form a potentially direct path.
3. (0,0) to (1,0) was validly connected with (0,0) <--> (1,0).
4. (1,0) to (2,0) followed, as indicated by (2,0) <--> (1,0).
5. Next, moving from (2,0) to (3,0) presented a direct route downward, supported by (2,0) <--> (3,0).
6. Continuing downwards from (3,0) to (3,1) was the only option to advance rightward, substantiated by (3,0) <--> (3,1).
7. From (3,1) to (3,2) maintained our rightward trajectory across the row, as marked by (3,1) <--> (3,2).
8. Finally, moving from (3,2) to (3,3) reached the designated target. This step was proper given (3,2) <--> (3,3) existence in the adjacency list.

I checked the path and confirmed that all moves are between direct adjacent cells with pre-existing connections from the adjacency list without crossing any unlisted walls or using non-adjacent steps.
