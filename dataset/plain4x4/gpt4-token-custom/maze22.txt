Starting with translating the adjacency list into a readable and analyzable graph, we learn that the maze is defined by connections between points (coordinates) as follows:
- (0,3) ↔ (0,2)
- (1,0) ↔ (2,0)
- (1,1) ↔ (1,0)
- (2,3) ↔ (3,3)
- (2,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (0,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (3,0) ↔ (3,1)
- (2,2) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,2) ↔ (3,1)
- (3,0) ↔ (2,0)
- (2,3) ↔ (2,2)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,2)
- (0,2) ↔ (0,1)
- (1,3) ↔ (1,2)
- (0,1) ↔ (0,0)

Based on the adjacency list:
1. The entry point or the origin of the maze is at (0,0).
2. The exit point or target of the maze is at (3,3).

To solve this maze, you would use a graph traversal technique, such as Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search, tracking visited nodes and following the paths according to the adjacency rules, while trying to reach the exit point from the starting point.

With the guided use of BFS over the graph represented above:
- Start at (0,0).
  - Possible moves: (0,1) as (0,0) ↔ (0,1).
- Move to (0,1).
  - Possible moves: (0,2) as (0,1) ↔ (0,2).
- Move to (0,2).
  - Possible moves: (0,3) as (0,3) ↔ (0,2) and (1,2) since (0,2) ↔ (1,2).
- Skipping Option (0,3) as it is a dead-end (only cycles back to (0,2)), move to (1,2).
  - Possible moves: (1,3) as (1,3) ↔ (1,2).
- Move to (1,3).
  - Possible moves: (2,3) as (2,3) ↔ (1,3).
- Move to (2,3).
  - Possible moves: (3,3) as (2,3) ↔ (3,3).

This pathway ensures you reach the exit by using only adjacent cells which are connected according to the adjacency list. Hence the path yield is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Upon checking back, each step taken moves through a valid connection (two cells that are directly linked) without crossing any walls, adhering to the adjacency restrictions set out in the maze's description. This solution thus both meets the structural constraints and leads from the maze entry to the exit.
