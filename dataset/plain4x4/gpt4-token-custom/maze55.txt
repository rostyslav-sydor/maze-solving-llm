<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Explanation of Calculations:

1. **Parsing the adjacency list**: Starting by parsing the provided list, each coordinate pair indication the node, and '<-->' showing the possible movements between nodes. This enables us to construct a valid graph representation where each node (coordinate) lists its neighbor nodes.

2. **Graph representation and pathfinding**:
   - From (0,0) you can go to (0,1) because (0,1) <--> (0,0) is valid.
   - From (0,1) you can go to (0,2) because (0,1) <--> (0,2) is valid.
   - From (0,2) you can go to (0,3) because (0,2) <--> (0,3) is valid.
   - From (0,3) you can go to (1,3) because (1,3) <--> (0,3) is valid.
   - From (1,3) you can proceed to (2,3) because (1,3) <--> (2,3) is valid.
   - From (2,3) you can move to (3,3) because (2,3) <--> (3,3) is valid.

3. **Validation of path against constraints**:
   - Ensuring that path strictly adheres to the constructed connections, with no movements skipping established adjacencies. This is verified through each consecutive node pair movement following a valid "<-->" link from the original adjacency list input.

This path flows logically from the designated entry point (0,0) to the exit (3,3), adhering to the maze's connectivity rules and efficiently finding a direct path across consecutively connected cells. The path proceeds right across the top row from (0,0) to (0,3) and seamlessly transitions through column 3 from top to bottom (0,3) to (3,3), marking a valid and feasible solution with all coordinates being adjacent either by row or column as specified by the maze's connections.
