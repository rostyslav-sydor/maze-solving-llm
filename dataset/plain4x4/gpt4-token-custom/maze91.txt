<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind Calculations:**

1. **Start from Origin (0,0)**: The origin point is (0,0), and the target is (3,3).

2. **Path Selection**:
   - From (0,0), according to the adjacency list, possible moves are to (0,1).
   - From (0,1), next moves are to (0,2) or (1,1). Proceed to (0,2) followed by (0,3) as it progresses toward the target along column 3.
   - From (0,3), there are connections to either (1,3) or (0,2). Since (0,2) is backward, move to (1,3).
   - From (1,3), the next options are (2,3) or backtrack to (1,2) or (0,3). Thus, (2,3) is chosen continuing vertically towards the target.
   - From (2,3), the move to (3,3) is direct.

3. **Checking Path Validity**:
   - All the chosen moves are adjacent connections provided in the adjacency list: 
     - (0,0) <--> (0,1)
     - (0,1) <--> (0,2)
     - (0,2) <--> (0,3)
     - (0,3) <--> (1,3)
     - (1,3) <--> (2,3)
     - (2,3) <--> (3,3)
   - The path progressively moves toward the target without any loops or invalid jumps between non-adjacent nodes.

4. **End at Target (3,3)**: The end of the path is the target (3,3), confirming the path is correct and efficient. No walls are crossed, and the path adheres to the adjacency connections listed.

This path is the most straightforward option moving vertically along the columns on the far right side towards the target, utilizing direct connections and avoiding unnecessary detours.
