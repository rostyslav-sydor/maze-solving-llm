Based on the provided adjacency list, the maze structure can be visualized as a graph where each node represents a coordinate and each edge between nodes indicates that one can move directly between those coordinates. To find the path from the origin (entry) point (0,0) to the target (exit) point (3,3), I follow the edges in a way that connects these points through valid adjacencies.

Reading the adjacency list and understanding the connectivity:
- Each pair shows direct connections between nodes, meaning you can move straight from one coordinate to another without hitting a wall. 

Starting point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3). Here's a step-by-step traversal:
1. Start at the origin (0,0). 
2. You can move from (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0) as shown in adjacency pairs.
3. Continue from (0,1) to (0,2) then to (1,2).
4. From (1,2) go to (2,2).
5. Proceed from (2,2) to (3,2).
6. Move from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the exit.

Tracking traversal:
- (0,0) to (0,1) - connected.
- (0,1) to (0,2) - connected.
- (0,2) to (1,2) - connected.
- (1,2) to (2,2) - connected.
- (2,2) to (3,2) - connected.
- (3,2) to (3,3) - connected.

Hence, the solution path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each step in this path uses coordinates that directly connect according to the adjacency list, ensuring that no walls are crossed and only adjacent cells are used according to the connections specified in the list. As a result, this path is valid and satisfies all the conditions laid out in the maze design.
