To solve the maze given in the adjacency list, I'll interpret the list and systematically check possible pathways from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list indicates which cells (or rooms) directly connect to each other. The goal is to trace a path from the starting point to the end without crossing through unconnected nodes (cells).

Here is a read-through interpretation and pathway deduction:

1. Starting at the origin (0,0), the viable connections are to (1,0) and (0,1).
   
2. From (0,0) moving to (1,0), the next possible moves are back to (0,0) or to (1,1).

3. Continuing from (1,0) to (1,1), the next options are back to (1,0) or forward to (2,1).

4. Progress from (1,1) to (2,1), with the available connections next to (1,1) or (3,1).

5. Moving from (2,1) to (3,1), the subsequent options shift slightly to back to (2,1) or further up to (3,2).

6. From (3,1) continuing to (3,2), and here you can go back to (3,1) or directly to the target (3,3).

Summarizing these connectivity-based decisions, the path taken from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is as follows:

0 -> (0,0)
1 -> (1,0)
2 -> (1,1)
3 -> (2,1)
4 -> (3,1)
5 -> (3,2)
6 -> (3,3)

Let's output this as a path representation:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

After formulating this pathway, I rechecked the connections to confirm none of the moves jump over walls or unconnected spaces. Each move strictly utilizes the adjacency definitions initially provided, adhering to moving only between directly linked nodes. 

Hence, this solution is valid and satisfies the maze constraints without crossing any walls or using any non-adjacent cells.
