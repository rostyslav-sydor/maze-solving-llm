<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To find the solution for the maze represented by the adjacency list:

1. **Parse the adjacency list**: We first interpret the adjacency list to understand the structure of the maze:
   - (1,0) is connected to (1,1)
   - (2,0) is connected to (3,0)
   - (0,3) is connected to (1,3)
   - (0,1) is connected to (0,0)
   - (0,2) is connected to (0,1)
   - (3,3) is connected to (3,2)
   - (2,1) is connected to (1,1)
   - (1,0) is connected to (0,0)
   - (1,2) is connected to (2,2)
   - (1,3) is connected to (2,3)
   - (0,2) is connected to (0,3)
   - (3,2) is connected to (3,1)
   - (2,1) is connected to (3,1)
   - (3,1) is connected to (3,0)
   - (2,3) is connected to (2,2)

2. **Identify the start and end points**:
   - Start: (0,0)
   - End: (3,3)

3. **Plan a path**:
   - Begin at (0,0). From there, the only possible move is to (1,0).
   - From (1,0), move next to (1,1).
   - From (1,1), move to (2,1), which connects seamlessly to (3,1).
   - From (3,1), move northwards in the same column to (3,2).
   - Finally, move from (3,2) to reach the target (3,3).

4. **Validate the path**:
   - The path (0,0) to (1,0) is valid as both are directly connected.
   - (1,0) to (1,1) is connected.
   - (1,1) to (2,1) is connected.
   - (2,1) to (3,1) is connected through (3,1) directly.
   - (3,1) to (3,2) is connected.
   - (3,2) to (3,3) is connected.
   - The path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent, directly connected cells.

By verifying each step from the ciphered adjacency list and the start and finish points, this solution is both optimal and respects the maze's structure, ensuring a proper path from entrance to exit without any violations.
