To find a path through the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), the adjacency list provided can be analyzed using a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, I describe the steps of BFS and then verify if the generated solution path only consists of adjacent valid cells.

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Coordinates (nodes) such as (x, y) given which can be connected to adjacent nodes listed in the adjacency list.

2. **Breadth First Search (BFS):**
   - BFS would start at the origin (0,0) and explore all adjacent nodes layers by layers.
   - BFS uses a queue to track the nodes to be explored and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
   - The algorithm iteratively processes all nodes at the current layer before moving on to nodes at the next layer, ensuring shortest path due to equal weighted edges (path between nodes).

3. **Build BFS:**
   - Start BFS at the origin (0,0).
   - From (0,0), valid moves are to (0,1) based on the adjacency.
   - From (0,1), move to (0,2).
   - From (0,2), move to (0,3).
   - From (0,3), you can move to (1,3).
   - Continue from (1,3) to (2,3).
   - Move from (2,3) to (3,3), which is the target.

4. **Path Deduction:**
   - BFS will find this path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

5. **Validation of Path:**
   - Validate the path based on adjacency; every step in the path corresponds to a valid transition in the adjacency list.
   - All transitions in the path:
       - (0,0) to (0,1)
       - (0,1) to (0,2)
       - (0,2) to (0,3)
       - (0,3) to (1,3)
       - (1,3) to (2,3)
       - (2,3) to (3,3)
   - All transitions are valid as per the adjacency connections provided in the input list.

Thus, after applying BFS and verifying that each step in the path is supported by an adjacency (connection), we confirm this is a valid and shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
