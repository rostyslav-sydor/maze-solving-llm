To find a path through the maze from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), we first understand that each point pair in the adjacency list signifies directly connected cells where movement is allowed.

The adjacency list allows us to create a graph representation of the maze:
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)

Starting from (0,0), we need to choose paths that connect to adjacent cells all the way to (3,3). Here's the step-by-step movement:

1. Start at (0,0), and the adjacent cells are (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From (0,0), move to (0,1) -- since (0,0) <--> (0,1) is available.
3. From (0,1), move next to (0,2) -- connection is (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. Continue from (0,2) to (1,2) -- connection is (1,2) <--> (0,2).
5. From (1,2), continue the path to (2,2) -- connection is (2,2) <--> (1,2).
6. From (2,2), move to (3,2) -- connection is (3,2) <--> (2,2).
7. Finally, travel from (3,2) to (3,3) -- connection being (3,3) <--> (3,2).

This path crosses no walls, adheres to adjacency connections provided, and brings us from the given origin to the target without revisiting any nodes.

The final solution for the path through the maze is:
<Path_Start> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_End>

Each step between two coordinates in this path is allowed by the adjacency list, confirming that the path is valid and uses only adjacent cells without crossing any walls.
