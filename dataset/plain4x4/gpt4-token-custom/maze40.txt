To solve the maze, we begin by constructing an adjacency representation of the maze based on the provided adjacency list. We then use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Starting with the adjacency list:
```
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
(1,0) <--> (0,0) 
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,0) <--> (2,1)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
```

Transforming the adjacency into a graph representation where each node represents a coordinate in the maze, and each edge represents a passage between two adjacent cells.

On applying BFS:

1. Start at the origin (0,0). Add this to the queue.
2. Expand from (0,0) to (1,0) according to the adjacency (1,0) <--> (0,0).
3. Expand from (1,0) to (2,0).
4. Expand from (2,0) through its connections to (2,1) and (3,0).
5. Continue expansion. From (3,0) to (3,1) to (3,2) and finally to (3,3).
6. BFS ensures that this is the shortest path due to its level-wise exploration from the source.

Documenting the shortest path:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

As we record each step:
- Review each step to verify it matches adjacency information and no "walls" are bypassed.
- Confirm each cell is aligned properly with its neighbors.
- Ensure path transitions are recorded in the adjacency list.

Final output of the path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path adheres to the adjacency relationships provided, uses all directly connected cells, and does not cross any obstacles or walls, making it a valid solution to the maze.
