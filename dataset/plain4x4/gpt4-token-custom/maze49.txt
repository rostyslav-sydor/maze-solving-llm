<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To determine the path from the entrance (0,0) to the exit (3,3) in the maze:

1. Begin at (0,0). According to the adjacent list, (1,0) connects to (0,0), providing a direct path south.
2. Move to (1,0). From (1,0), the next connection is (2,0), continuing down.
3. Transition to (2,0). From (2,0), move further down to (3,0), adhering to the listed connections.
4. At (3,0), the direct connection to (3,1) pushes the path right, towards the east.
5. Moving to (3,1). The adjacent list then shows (3,1) connects to (3,2), continue rightwards.
6. Advance to (3,2). From here, directly connect to (3,3), the exit point, staying within the adjacency rules.

This path utilizes only valid links like specified in the adjacency list and does not skip any cells or cross any barriers not mentioned on the list. Each move is to an adjacent cell, conforming to the adjacency rules provided. Thus, the exit is successfully reached without crossing walls or using non-adjacent cells.
