<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. The problem is a pathfinding problem in a graph represented as an adjacency list between nodes.
2. The nodes are coordinates in a maze, and the edges signify the passageways between adjacent cells.
3. We begin at the origin `(0,0)` and must find a route to the target `(3,3)` using available pathways.

**Path Construction Steps:**
- Start at the origin `(0,0)`.
- From `<ADJLIST_START>`, locate the edges where `(0,0)` has a connection. We can move from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)`.
- From `(1,0)`, look for connections again in the adjacency list. Move next to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, continue to `(2,1)`, since both are directly connected.
- Then, proceed from `(2,1)` to `(3,1)`.
- From `(3,1)`, analyze the possible moves. Proceed to `(3,2)`.
- Finally, move from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)` according to the adjacency list.

**Verification:**
- Check each step to verify if each consecutive pair of coordinates in the path list appears directly connected in the adjacency list;
  `(0,0)` <-> `(1,0)`;
  `(1,0)` <-> `(1,1)`;
  `(1,1)` <-> `(2,1)`;
  `(2,1)` <-> `(3,1)`;
  `(3,1)` <-> `(3,2)`;
  `(3,2)` <-> `(3,3)`.
- Ensure no walls are crossed, and each movement is to an adjacent cell.

The chosen path confirms that each move respects the maze's adjacency restrictions and properly follows the layout provided in the adjacency list. Thus, the solution is valid and does not violate any maze structure rules.
