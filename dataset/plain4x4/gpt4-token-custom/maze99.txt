To solve the maze, I will interpret the adjacency list to create a map of the maze and determine possible paths from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using these paths.

Here are the explicit pairs from the adjacency list showing the connected nodes:
```
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(2,1) <--> (3,1)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(1,3) <--> (1,2)
(2,0) <--> (2,1)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
```

Starting from the origin at (0,0), follow connections through this graph to reach the target (3,3):

1. Begin at (0,0). Available paths are to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), available paths lead to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), we can move to (0,1).
4. From (0,1), go to (0,2).
5. From (0,2), proceed to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), move on to either (1,3) or (2,2). We choose (1,3).
7. Moving from (1,3), advance to (2,3).
8. From (2,3), the path leads directly to (3,3), our destination.

Path reconstructed:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Thus, the path entirely uses valid connections between cells specified in the adjacency list, ensuring no walls are crossed, and each move is between adjacent cells. Therefore:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
