Given the adjacency list and specified origin and target points, we can represent the connections as follows:

- (0,0) ↔ (0,1) ↔ (0,2)
- (0,0) ↔ (1,0) ┄ (1,0) ↔ (1,1) ↔ (1,2) ↔ (1,3) ┄ (1,3) ↔ (0,3)
- (0,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (2,0) ↔ (3,0) ┄ (3,0) ↔ (3,1) ┄ (3,1) ↔ (2,1) ┄ (2,1) ↔ (1,1)
- (2,2) ↔ (2,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (2,2) ↔ (3,2) ┄ (3,2) ↔ (3,3)
- (2,3) ↔ (1,3)

The objective is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Starting from the origin:
1. From (0,0), go to (1,0) using the connection [(0,0) ↔ (1,0)].
2. Then move to (1,1) through (1,0) ↔ (1,1).
3. Proceed to (1,2) using (1,1) ↔ (1,2).
4. Head to (2,2) through (1,2) ↔ (2,2).
5. Next, go to (3,2) via (2,2) ↔ (3,2).
6. Finally, move to the target (3,3) through (3,2) ↔ (3,3).

Now, let's validate the path. It must be checked for any intersections with walls or non-adjacencies:
- Each step moves to an immediately adjacent cell connected by a specified edge in the list.
- The chosen path does not cross unlisted edges.

The chosen path is consistent with the adjacency list, forming a connected sequence without breaking any constraints. Thus, it emerges as a viable solution.

Output of the solution will be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
