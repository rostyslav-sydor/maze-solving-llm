To solve the maze, we'll first map out the connections from the given adjacency list and then find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 

Step 1: Maze Representation
We understand that each pair of coordinates in the adjacency list implies a direct connection that can be traversed. The adjacency list provided gives us the following connections:
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (2,3) <-> (2,2)
- (2,1) <-> (2,0)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)
- (1,1) <-> (0,1)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,1) <-> (1,2)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)

Step 2: Path Searching
We need to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3). Considering all adjacent cell connections:
- Start at the origin (0,0). The only adjacent cell in the list is (1,0).
- From (1,0) move to adjacent cell (2,0).
- Proceed from (2,0) to (2,1).
- Move from (2,1) to (3,1).
- Then proceed to (3,2).
- Finally from (3,2) move to the target (3,3).

This path ensures that each move is to an adjacent cell that is directly connected as per the adjacency list.

Step 3: Solution Path
Final check of the solution path:
- The path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) found: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3). Each of these moves is valid per the adjacency list, without crossing any unconnected walls and smoothly navigating through accessible paths.

Hence, the path is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path delivers a correct route based on the adjacency constraints and moves through only connected and adjacent cells from the origin to the target in the maze.
