To solve the maze provided as an adjacency list, we first need to interpret the structure of the maze. The maze entry point is at (0,0) and the exit is at (3,3). Each pair in the adjacency list describes which cells in the maze are directly connected, meaning one can move from one cell to another without hitting a wall.

I'll trace the path from the entry to the exit, ensuring that each step is valid based on the adjacency list:

1. Start at the origin: (0,0).
   
2. From (0,0), the adjacency list shows a direct connection to (1,0). Thus, move to (1,0).

3. From (1,0), look for adjacent connected nodes:
   - The adjacency list tells us (1,0) connects to (2,0).
   - So move to (2,0).

4. Now at (2,0), continue to an adjacent node:
   - There's a connection from (2,0) to (3,0).
   - So, move to (3,0).

5. At (3,0), we see connections in the list to (3,1).
   - Move to (3,1).

6. From (3,1), according to the adjacency list, it connects to both (2,1) and (3,2):
   - Choose to proceed vertically to (3,2). This choice keeps us closer to our target column.

7. From (3,2), we see in the list a connection to (3,3).
   - Move to (3,3), which is our target.

Checking the path consistency and that no walls are crossed:
- Confirm that all adjacent cells in the selected path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) are each directly connected via the adjacency list and that no movements jump over walls or non-connected cells.

Final path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is valid as it moves through directly connected cells, adhering to the maze's structure provided.
