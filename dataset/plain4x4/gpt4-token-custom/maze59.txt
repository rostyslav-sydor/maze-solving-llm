<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning for the Path:**

1. **Starting Point:** The problem statement identifies the maze's entry (origin) point as (0,0) and the exit (target) point as (3,3).

2. **Graph Examination:**
   - The adjacency list shows valid movements from cell to cell:
     - **From (0,0):** (0,0) <--> (1,0) and (0,0) <--> (0,1) meaning moving right to (1,0) or up to (0,1). 
     - **Movement Choices:**
       - From (1,0) next options are (2,0) or back to (0,0). Continuing forward to (2,0).
       - From (2,0) next options are (3,0) or back to (1,0). Continuing forward to (3,0).
       - From (3,0) next options are (3,1) or back to (2,0). Continuing upwards to (3,1).
       - From (3,1) next options are (3,2) or back to (3,0). Continuing upwards to (3,2).
       - From (3,2) next options are (3,3) or back to (3,1). Final move to the destination (3,3).

3. **Validation of Path:**
   - **No wall crossing:** On the examined path from (0,0) to (3,3), every consecutive coordinate pair reflects direct adjacencies in the given adjacency list. No pair jumps to a coordinate that isn't directly linked by the adjacency definition.
   - **Uses only adjacent cells:** Each consecutive move is either to an adjacent row or an adjacent column, never jumping cells or moving diagonally which isn't allowed in typical grid movement constraints.

Thus, the given path proceeds strictly through legitimate adjacencies in listed traversals from the starting to the target coordinate, adhering to the maze's structure without violating any movement rules. Hence, this is a valid solution path within the maze constraints provided.
