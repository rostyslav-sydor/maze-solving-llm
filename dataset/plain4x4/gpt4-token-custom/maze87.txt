To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list with given entry and exit points, we'll first decode the adjacency list to comprehend the maze structure, mapping the connections between coordinates and then finding a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using a suitable pathfinding algorithm like BFS.

First, let's break down the adjacency list:
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

Next, understand that each pair signifies directly connected cells, meaning a player can move directly between them without encountering a wall. Given these connections, visualizing or drawing the maze can assist in comprehending pathways.

Let's determine a path from (0,0) to (3,3):
1. Starting at (0,0), we see we can move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), proceed to (1,2).
4. Continue from (1,2) to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
6. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3).

Here are the moves analyzed:
- Initially, we have multiple options, but choosing the path through the top rows and then down, avoiding backtracking or traversal through unused grid parts, leads us directly to the target.
  
The path can be expressed as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution uses direct connections and valid pathways as per the adjacency list, without crossing any areas that aren't explicitly connected. We validated each step to ensure adjacency was maintained, relying on the given graph's connections to ensure no walls are crossed inappropriately.
