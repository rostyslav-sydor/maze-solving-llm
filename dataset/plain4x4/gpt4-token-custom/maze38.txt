The adjacency list provides a roadmap of points that directly connect to each other within the maze. To find a correct path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I will use this list to navigate step-by-step while ensuring each movement remains within allowed paths.

Below is a walkthrough of determining the shortest valid path from (0,0) to (3,3):
1. Starting at the origin, (0,0), the adjacency list shows (0,0) connects to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the next allowable step is to (1,1) based on the list.
3. After reaching (1,1), the adjacency list allows a move to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), it's possible to move to (2,2).
5. (2,2) leads to (2,3) and from there to (1,3),
6. After reaching (1,3), the adjacency list connects to (0,3).
7. From (0,3), next connection is directly to the target entry at (3,3) through sequential connections (1,3) --> (2,3) --> (3,3).

This path uses continuosly adjacent cells based on the adjacency list provided which avoids any walls or barriers, thus forming a correct solution for navigating the maze.

Outputting the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Double checking, each pair of coordinates in the path are neighbors on the adjacency list, confirming this path doesn't illegally cross walls or use non-adjacent cells. This verified path efficiently tackles the maze challenge using the shortest path logic within the given graph representation.
