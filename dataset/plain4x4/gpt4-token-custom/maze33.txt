To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list describes all possible moves between directly connected cells. We can model this as a graph traversal problem.

Here is how we'll proceed:

1. Create a graph from the adjacency list:
  - Nodes: each coordinate pair represents a unique location in the maze.
  - Edges: the connections between the nodes are given directly by the adjacency list.

2. Use a graph traversal algorithm, typically Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. BFS is a good choice as it finds the shortest path step by step, exploring all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Using the adjacency list, we model the graph as follows:
- (1,0) connects to [(2,0), (1,1)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (2,3) connects to [(2,2), (3,3)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,2)]
- (1,1) connects to [(0,1), (1,0)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,3), (3,1)]
- (3,3) connects to [(2,3), (3,2)]
- (1,3) connects to [(0,3), (1,2)]
- (2,0) connects to [(3,0), (1,0)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1)]
- (3,0) connects to [(3,1), (2,0)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2), (1,3)]
- (1,2) connects to [(1,3)]

Using BFS starting from node (0,0):
  - First, we add (0,0) to the queue.
  - We then explore each node, adding its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited.
  - We continue exploration until we find the target node (3,3).

After running the BFS, we find the path:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) (from adjacency: (0,0) <--> (0,1))
- Move to (1,1) (from adjacency: (0,1) <--> (1,1))
- Move to (1,0) considered, but it's a backtrack, ignore
- Move to (2,1) (from adjacency: (1,1) <--> (2,1))
- Move to (2,2) (from adjacency: (2,1) <--> (2,2))
- Move to (2,3) (from adjacency: (2,2) <--> (2,3))
- Move to (3,3) (from adjacency: (2,3) <--> (3,3))

The complete path finding checks:
- No walls are crossed; all movements are between directly connected nodes.
- Path uses only adjacent cells as described in the adjacency list.

The final path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
