To solve this maze problem, we need to perform these steps:

1. **Extract Nodes and Edges**: First, understand the structure from the adjacency list provided to determine each cell (node) and their connections (edges).

2. **Identify the Entry and Exit**: Recognize the starting point `(0,0)` and the target point `(3,3)` from the tokens `<ORIGIN_START/END>` and `<TARGET_START/END>`.

3. **Generate Possible Routes**: Using a pathfinding algorithm (such as Breadth-first Search (BFS), Depth-first Search (DFS), or A-star), explore the viable paths from the start node to the target node. Between nodes (cells), movements are only valid if directly connected as per the adjacency list.

4. **Validate the Path**: Ensure the chosen path continually advances through directly adjacent nodes and does not attempt to move diagonally or through non-connected nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, reconstructing the graph reveals these direct connections:
- From `(0,0)` connect to `(1,0)`
- From `(1,0)` connect to `(2,0)`
- From `(2,0)` connect to `(3,0)`
- From `(3,0)` connect to `(3,1)`
- From `(3,1)` connect to `(3,2)`
- And from `(3,2)` connect to `(3,3)`.

This sequence keeps all nodes directly connected as previous adjacent relations demonstrate in the list. Here it outlines the smallest number of steps or shortest possible path while adhering to constraints.

The path and adjacency analysis confirms:
- Each step in the path traverses through directly adjoining coordinates as presented in the adjacency list. 
- No walls are crossed, and no diagonal or disconnected movements are made.

Thus, the solution is formatted as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` using valid connections, following a straightforward and logical route via available paths in the maze.
