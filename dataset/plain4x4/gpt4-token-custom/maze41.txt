To solve this problem, we first construct a clear adjacency list of the maze using the given connections:

1. Parse through the ADJLIST and map each tuple to its connected tuple, treating each tuple as a vertex and connections as edges in the graph:
   ```
   (1,3) --> (2,3), (1,2), (0,3)
   (2,3) --> (1,3), (3,3)
   (3,2) --> (3,1), (2,2)
   (2,2) --> (1,2), (3,2)
   (1,2) --> (2,2), (1,3)
   (0,0) --> (0,1), (1,0)
   (0,1) --> (0,0), (1,1)
   (0,3) --> (0,2), (1,3)
   (0,2) --> (0,3)
   (1,1) --> (0,1) , (2,1)
   (3,3) --> (2,3)
   (2,0) --> (3,0)
   (3,0) --> (3,1), (2,0)
   (1,0) --> (0,0)
   (3,1) --> (3,2), (2,1), (3,0)
   (2,1) --> (3,1), (1,1)
   ```

2. Using the start coordinate (0,0), aim to traverse the maze graph towards the end coordinate (3,3). Employ a BFS (Breadth First Search) technique, which is apt for shortest path in unweighted graphs. Here is the process:
   - Start from the origin (0,0).
   - Explore all adjacent nodes.
   - Keep traversing until the target (3,3) is reached.

3. Based on the BFS traversal:
   - Start at (0,0), possibilities -> (0,1) or (1,0).
   - Continue from (0,1) -> (1,1).
   - Then from (1,1) -> (2,1).
   - From (2,1) -> (3,1).
   - From (3,1) -> (3,2).
   - Then from (3,2) -> (2,2).
   - From (2,2) -> (1,2).
   - From (1,2) -> (1,3).
   - From (1,3) -> (2,3).
   - Finally from (2,3) -> (3,3).

4. The path found:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

5. Validation:
   - Check each step to confirm traversal between connected nodes.
   - Confirm that no step transitions to an unconnected node or involves crossing any walls.
   - Ensure all steps involve only adjacent cells.

This BFS-based solution efficiently finds a path from the origin to the target within the described maze rules.
