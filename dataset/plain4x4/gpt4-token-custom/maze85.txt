To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I would follow these steps:

1. **Construct the Graph:**
   - Parse the adjacency list to construct a graph where each cell (position in the maze) is a node, and each connection between cells is represented by an edge.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   From the adjacency list, I construct a representation of the maze graph:
   ```
   (1,1) <-> (0,1)
   (1,0) <-> (0,0)
   (3,2) <-> (3,3)
   (2,3) <-> (3,3)
   (0,3) <-> (1,3)
   (2,0) <-> (3,0)
   (1,3) <-> (2,3)
   (3,2) <-> (3,1)
   (1,1) <-> (2,1)
   (3,0) <-> (3,1)
   (1,2) <-> (0,2)
   (2,2) <-> (2,3)
   (0,2) <-> (0,1)
   (2,0) <-> (1,0)
   (2,2) <-> (1,2)
   ```

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm:**
   - Use a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore the maze starting from the origin node (0,0). BFS is suitable here as it finds the shortest path and explores all possible routes uniformly.

4. **Finding the Path:**
   - From (0,0), BFS would explore its connections and proceed along the shortest path to (3,3). Given the constructed graph, BFS would find the following path:
     - Start from (0,0).
     - Move to (1,0) which is connected to (0,0).
     - Move to (2,0) connected to (1,0).
     - Move to (3,0) connected to (2,0).
     - Move to (3,1) connected to (3,0).
     - Move to (3,2) connected to (3,1).
     - Move to (3,3) connected to (3,2).
   - This sequence ensures all moves are to adjacent cells as per the graph connections.

5. **Output the Path:**
   - Compile the path into the required format:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

6. **Validation:**
   - Verify that each move from one cell to the next is allowed by the adjacency list and that no walls are crossed (i.e., no direct moves between cells that are not directly connected).
   - The path uses only adjacent cells for each move, following the data in the adjacency list.

This solution constructs the path safely and correctly by respecting the adjacency of the maze's cells and using an effective algorithm to find the shortest path.
