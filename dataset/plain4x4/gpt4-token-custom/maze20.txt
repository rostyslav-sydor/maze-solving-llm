To solve the maze, we start by identifying the relationships in the adjacency list which depict the paths between adjacent cells within the grid. We then map the maze onto a grid-like structure based on the adjacency relationships:

- Cells with connections:
  (1,2) <--> (1,1)
  (3,1) <--> (3,0)
  (1,3) <--> (1,2)
  (3,3) <--> (2,3)
  (1,2) <--> (0,2)
  (3,2) <--> (3,3)
  (3,0) <--> (2,0)
  (1,0) <--> (0,0)
  (2,1) <--> (2,2)
  (2,0) <--> (1,0)
  (3,1) <--> (3,2)
  (2,1) <--> (1,1)
  (0,1) <--> (0,0)
  (2,3) <--> (1,3)
  (0,3) <--> (0,2)
  
Let's decode the adjacency list into a matrix:
```
    (0,0) -- (0,1)    (0,2) -- (0,3)
     |        |         |
    (1,0) -- (1,1) -- (1,2) -- (1,3)
     |                 |
    (2,0) -- (2,1) -- (2,2)    (2,3) -- (3,3)
     |                  |        |         |
    (3,0) -- (3,1) -- (3,2)
```

- The entry point of the maze is marked at (0,0).
- The exit point of the maze is marked at (3,3).

From the start (0,0), you can traverse the maze to reach various points based on the connections provided.

By checking paths, we can devise a route:

- Start at (0,0)
- Travel vertically downward from (0,0) to (1,0)
- Travel horizontally to the right from (1,0) to (2,0)
- Travel vertically downward to (3,0)
- Travel horizontally to the right from (3,0) to reach (3,1), then (3,2)
- Finally from (3,2), travel to (3,3) via (2,3).

Let's now outline the path from the origin to the target:
```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```

Hence, we get a full path starting at (0,0) and reaching (3,3), using only valid paths specified in the adjacency list.

This series of movements can now be encapsulated:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution navigates through adjacent cells as defined by the adjacency list and reaches the target from the origin without crossing any walls, confirming the path is valid and continuous based on the described maze connectivity.
