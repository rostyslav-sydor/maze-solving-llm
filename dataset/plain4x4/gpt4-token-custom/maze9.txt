To solve the maze, I will use the graph's adjacency list to understand the connections between cells and apply Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Given the graph:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0) and (0,1)
- (1,0) connects to (0,0) and (2,0)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0) and (3,0)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (0,2) connects to (0,1) and (0,3)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2) and (1,3)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3) and (1,2)
- (1,2) connects to (1,3) and (2,2)
- (2,2) connects to (1,2) and (2,3)
- (2,3) connects to (2,2) and (3,3)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3) and (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1) and (3,3)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2) and (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0) and (1,1) and (3,1)

Using BFS, starting from (0,0):
1. Enqueue the start point (0,0) with path [(0,0)].
2. Dequeue (0,0), check its neighbors: (1,0) and (0,1). Enqueue these with the path to each.
3. Dequeue (1,0), check its neighbors: it connects to (2,0). Enqueue (2,0) with path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)].
4. Continue visiting in BFS order, expanding paths to neighbor nodes, avoiding revisiting cells, till you reach exit (3,3).

The path is determined as (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This is shortest considering no diagonal moves are allowed, each step to an adjacent cell is necessary.

Now, let's verify the path:
- (0,0) to (1,0) is a direct connection.
- (1,0) to (2,0) is connected.
- (2,0) to (3,0) is connected.
- (3,0) to (3,1) is connected.
- (3,1) to (3,2) is connected.
- (3,2) to (3,3) is connected.

This path adheres strictly to the adjacency list (no additional walls are crossed), and each step progresses to an adjacent cell in the maze.

Final solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
