To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list of graph edges, we first construct the graph and identify a path from the origin to the target using effective pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS). 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I reasoned out the solution from the maze representation given:

1. **Construct the Graph**: List every coordination and its connections (coordinates it can directly move to):
   - `(1,3)` connects to `(0,3)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,3)`
   - `(3,2)` connects to `(2,2)`, `(3,3)`
   - `(0,0)` connects to `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`
   - `(2,3)` connects to `(1,3)`, `(3,3)`
   - `(1,1)` connects to `(2,1)`, `(1,2)`
   - `(3,3)` connects to `(2,3)`, `(3,2)`
   - `(0,1)` connects to `(0,0)`, `(0,2)`
   - `(2,1)` connects to `(1,1)`, `(3,1)`
   - `(3,1)` connects to `(2,1)`, `(3,0)`
   - `(0,2)` connects to `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`
   - `(1,0)` connects to `(0,0)`
   - `(3,0)` connects to `(3,1)`, `(2,0)`
   - `(2,0)` connects to `(3,0)`

2. **Define Start and End Points**:
   - Origin (start point): `(0,0)`
   - Target (exit point): `(3,3)`

3. **Find the Path Using BFS**:
   - Start BFS from `(0,0)`, looking to reach `(3,3)`.
   - Visiting neighbors, we follow paths that are directly connected:
   - `(0,0)` to `(0,1)` 
   - `(0,1)` to `(0,2)`
   - `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`
   - `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`
   - `(1,3)` to `(2,3)`
   - `(2,3)` to `(3,3)`

4. **Compile Final Path**:
   - List all the nodes visited in sequence without repetition to reach from origin to target.

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Ensure the chosen path does not cross nodes that are not directly linked.
   - Confirm every move steps only to adjacent cells provided in the adjacency list.
   - Here, all moves are valid as they follow direct links mentioned.

By following these steps using the adjacency list, I determined the valid, shortest path through the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path leads from the entrance `(0,0)` to the exit `(3,3)`, passing through legitimate routes as described by the original adjacency list. Each step moves from one coordinate to an adjacent coordinate, ensuring no violations of maze walls or restrictions.
