<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Starting at the entry point (0,0), we look for adjacent nodes to move towards the exit (3,3). 
2. From (0,0), the adjacent nodes specified in the list are (1,0).
3. From (1,0), possible movement is towards (1,1), as it's the only adjacent cell connected and progressing towards our goal.
4. From (1,1), we proceed to (1,2), which is connected and brings us closer to the target in the upward direction.
5. From (1,2), we proceed to (0,2) as it's adjacent and nearer the upper boundary (better alignment with our linear approach moving upwards).
6. From (0,2), movement to (0,3) is possible since they are connected.
7. (0,3) can move to (1,3) which connects directly and brings us closer to the desired column of the target.
8. (1,3) connects to (2,3), which brings us nearer to the target row.
9. Finally, from (2,3), we move to (3,3) which is the exit point.

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells as defined in the maze's adjacency list. Each step is verified from the adjacency list to ensure there's a direct connection between the nodes (i.e., cells in the maze), complying with the given maze structure.
