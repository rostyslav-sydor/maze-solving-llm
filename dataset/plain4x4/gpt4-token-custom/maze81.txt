<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, the path begins at the origin point (0,0) and progresses to the target point (3,3). The moves were made as follows:

1. From (0,0) to (0,1) - the adjacency list contains (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2. From (0,1) to (0,2) - the adjacency list contains (0,2) <--> (0,1)
3. From (0,2) to (0,3) - the adjacency list contains (0,2) <--> (0,3)
4. From (0,3) to (1,3) - the adjacency list contains (1,3) <--> (0,3)
5. From (1,3) to (2,3) - the adjacency list contains (1,3) <--> (2,3)
6. From (2,3) to (3,3) - the adjacency list lists (3,3) <--> (2,3)

Throughout this path:
- All steps take us from one cell to a directly adjoining cell.
- Each consecutive pair of coordinates is adjacent in the maze's graph.
- There are no detours or backtracking: the shortest route is found, always proceeding toward the target, without violating any maze walls as per the adjacency list.

Thus, the provided solution is efficient and adheres strictly to the possible pathways shown in the adjacency list.
