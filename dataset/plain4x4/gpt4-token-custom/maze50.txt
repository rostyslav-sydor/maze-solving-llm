To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I first convert the list into a graph data structure that can be more easily traversed. Then, I will use a path-finding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

1. Generate the graph:
    - Convert the adjacency list which defines connections between cells (nodes) into a graph. Each tuple pair (e.g., (2,1) <--> (1,1)) indicates a two-way connection.

2. Implement BFS:
    - Initialize a queue with the start point, here defined by `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>`.
    - Begin BFS traversal from the origin `(0,0)` marking nodes as visited and recording the route taken by keeping a "parent" map.
    - Continue exploring all connected nodes one level at a time until the target `(3,3)` (given by `<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>`) is reached.
    - Using the parent map, construct the path from the target back to the origin.

3. Path extraction:
    - Start at the target `(3,3)` and trace back to the origin `(0,0)` using the parent mapping created during BFS, this provides the path used to reach the target.
    - The path sequence should not cross any cells that are not connected directly by the adjacency list, ensuring that no walls or non-adjacent cells are breached.

4. Format output:
    - Prepare the path list from the BFS result (reversed for proper order from origin to target).
    - Output the path in the requested format using the tags `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.

5. Verify the solution:
    - Ensure that each consecutive pair of nodes in the constructed path has a direct edge as per the adjacency list (e.g., no leaps across non-connected cells).
    - Make sure that the path originates at `(0,0)` and terminates at `(3,3)`, using the only allowed connections.

Based on the steps and algorithm used:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This proposed solution meets the criteria as each step moves between directly connected nodes, following a plausible route from the origin to the target within the constraints of the adjacency list provided.
