<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning the path:
1. **From the Origin (0,0) to (1,0)**: This transition is allowed as per adjacency "(0,0) <--> (1,0)".
2. **From (1,0) to (2,0)**: The adjacency "(2,0) <--> (1,0)" permits this move.
3. **From (2,0) to (3,0)**: This move is possible because of the adjacency "(2,0) <--> (3,0)".
4. **From (3,0) to (3,1)**: Valid transition as stated in adjacency "(3,0) <--> (3,1)".
5. **From (3,1) to (3,2)**: Allowed by the adjacency "(3,1) <--> (3,2)".
6. **From (3,2) to (3,3)**: This final move to the target is enabled by the adjacency "(3,3) <--> (3,2)".

Checking walls and valid connections:
- The chosen path does not cross any walls as all the moves are between directly connected nodes according to the adjacency list provided.
- All the coordinates in the path are adjacent to each other as per the adjacency list.

Thus, the solution follows the rules of the maze, doesn't cross walls, and uses only adjacent cells as required.
