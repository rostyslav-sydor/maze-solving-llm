<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0) which is given by `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>`.
2. From (0,0), move horizontally to (0,1) since it is connected as shown by `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`.
3. Continue horizontally to (0,2) which connects from (0,1) as per `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`.
4. Move upward to (1,2), following the adjacency `(0,2) <--> (1,2)`.
5. Continue upwards to reach (1,3), following the adjacency `(1,2) <--> (1,3)`.
6. Move to (2,3) using the adjacency link `(1,3) <--> (2,3)`.
7. From (2,3), go horizontally to (2,2) because of `(2,3) <--> (2,2)`.
8. Enter row 3 at (3,2) according to `(2,2) <--> (3,2)`.
9. Lastly, move to the target (3,3) along the corridor `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`, which is detailed by `<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>`.

**Verification:**
- Each connection used exists in the adjacency list.
- No cell is skipped or jumped over between consecutive steps, maintaining adjacency only.
- The path starts at the specified origin and ends at the specified target, obeying all given paths and connections.
