To solve the maze, I will first translate the adjacency list into a more visual or conceptual representation, and then find a path from the origin to the target using search techniques.

1. Read and extract the adjacency list betwen `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`:
   - (2,2) <-> (2,3)
   - (2,2) <-> (2,1)
   - (2,0) <-> (3,0)
   - (0,1) <-> (0,2)
   - (3,1) <-> (3,0)
   - (0,1) <-> (0,0)
   - (1,1) <-> (2,1)
   - (1,1) <-> (1,2)
   - (1,0) <-> (0,0)
   - (0,3) <-> (1,3)
   - (2,1) <-> (2,0)
   - (3,2) <-> (3,1)
   - (0,2) <-> (0,3)
   - (1,3) <-> (2,3)
   - (3,2) <-> (3,3)

2. Define the origin (entry point) and target (exit point) using `<ORIGIN_START/END>` and `<TARGET_START/END>`:
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

3. To reach the target from the origin:
   - Start from (0,0), possible movements based on adjacency:
       → to (1,0) and (0,1)
   - From (0,1), move to:
       → (0,0), (0,2)
       → continue to (0,2)
   - From (0,2), move to:
       → (0,1), (0,3)
       → continue to (0,3)
   - From (0,3), move to:
       → (0,2), (1,3)
       → continue to (1,3)
   - From (1,3), move to:
       → (0,3), (2,3)
       → continue to (2,3)
   - From (2,3), move to:
       → (1,3), (2,2)
       → continue to (2,2)
   - From (2,2), move to:
       → (2,1), (2,3)
       → continue to (2,1)
   - From (2,1), move to:
       → (2,2), (1,1), (2,0)
       → continue to (2,0)
   - From (2,0), move to:
       → (3,0), (2,1)
       → continue to (3,0)
   - From (3,0), move to:
       → (3,1), (2,0)
       → continue to (3,1)
   - From (3,1), move to:
       → (3,0), (3,2)
       → continue to (3,2)
   - From (3,2), move to:
       → (3,1), (3,3)
       → continue to (3,3)
   - Arrival at (3,3)

4. The path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:
   - (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

5. Verification:
   - Check the path makes logical connections based on the adjacency list and moves only between directly connected cells.

6. Conclusion:
   - The generated path is consistent with the adjacency list and adheres to the rules of the maze.

Final formatted path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
