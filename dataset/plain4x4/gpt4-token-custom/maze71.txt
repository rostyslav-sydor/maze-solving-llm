To find a solution to the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, I will first parse the adjacency list to understand the connectivity of cells in the maze. The key is to create a graph where nodes are positions in the maze (represented as coordinates), and edges show possible movements between these nodes.

I will then employ a graph traversal technique such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point (origin) (0,0) to the exit point (target) (3,3).

- Firstly, we create a graph from the adjacency list:
  ```
  (2,2) <-> (3,2)
  (1,0) <-> (0,0)
  (0,2) <-> (1,2)
  (2,0) <-> (3,0)
  (3,0) <-> (3,1)
  (0,2) <-> (0,3)
  (2,3) <-> (3,3)
  (0,1) <-> (0,0)
  (0,1) <-> (1,1)
  (3,2) <-> (3,3)
  (3,1) <-> (3,2)
  (2,1) <-> (2,2)
  (2,1) <-> (1,1)
  (1,2) <-> (1,3)
  (1,3) <-> (2,3)
  ```

- The graph representation would look like this:
  - Coordinates like (0,0) connects to (1,0), (0,1).
  - Keep mapping in such a way using the adjacency list given.

- Applying BFS, starting from (0,0):
  1. From (0,0), moves to (1,0) and (0,1).
  2. From (0,1), can move to (1,1).
  3. Continue exploring from each accessible node:
     - Continue expanding from the next accessible nodes by following the graph connectivity.
  
- Path Discovery through BFS:
  1. Start at (0,0), add to the queue.
  2. Explore neighbors, reach (1,0), and (0,1).
  3. Go from (0,1) to (1,1), from (1,1) to (2,1), and continue in this pattern.
  4. Eventually, through successive steps, and ensuring not to re-visit nodes, BFS would reach the node (3,3), hence finding the path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

- Path will be carefully constructed ensuring traversal only happens between connected nodes and no walls are crossed.

The path that traces through the maze from the origin to the target via only permissible routes is:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path uses only connected nodes based on the input adjacency list, showing a successful pathfind from origin to target in the maze.
