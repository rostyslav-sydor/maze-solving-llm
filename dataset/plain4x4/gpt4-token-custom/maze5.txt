To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I will find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). I'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is suitable for mazes as each step between two coordinates has equal weight.

Here's how I will proceed:
1. Parse the adjacency list to form a graph.
2. Initialize the BFS with the origin point and explore all connected paths.
3. Track visited nodes to avoid revisiting the same locations.
4. Once reaching the target, backtrack to form the path sequence.

**Parsed Adjacency List:** Transforming the input into a more structured representation like a dictionary where each node points to its adjacent nodes:

- (3,0) connects to [(3,1), (2,0)]
- (1,1) connects to [(1,2), (2,1), (0,1)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2), (1,3)]
- (1,0) connects to [(2,0), (0,0)]
- (2,1) connects to [(1,1), (2,0)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,3), (0,1)]
- (0,1) connects to [(1,1), (0,2)]
- (3,3) connects to [(3,2), (2,3)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,3), (2,2)]

**BFS Steps:**
- Start at (0,0).
- Visit [(0,0)]: Check all neighbors [(1,0)].
- Visit [(1,0)]: From here, move to [(2,0)].
- Visit [(2,0)]: Choices are [(3,0), (1,0), (2,1)].
- Visit [(3,0)]: From here, go to [(3,1)].
- Visit [(3,1)]: Only move we can make is to [(3,2)].
- Visit [(3,2)]: From here, go to [(3,3)].
- (3,3) is the target.

**Path from (0,0) to (3,3)**:
- Starting from (0,0), follow the trace from BFS to get all coordinates: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

**Verification**:
- Each step in the path is directly connected according to the adjacency list, meaning there are no jumps between non-connected nodes.
- The path uses legal moves as specified by the adjacency list, ensuring its validity.

**Output**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution provides the correct path from entry to exit, adhering to the constraints of the maze, ensuring no walls are crossed and only adjacent cells are used in the path.
