To solve the maze, let's first visualize and understand the adjacency list provided, then find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3):

1. **Convert the adjacency list into a usable data structure**: 
   The adjacency list representation is like:
   - (3,2) <--> (3,3)
   - (1,3) <--> (2,3)
   - (1,2) <--> (1,1)
   - (0,1) <--> (0,0)
   - (3,1) <--> (3,0)
   - (2,2) <--> (2,1)
   - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
   - (0,2) <--> (0,1)
   - (3,0) <--> (2,0)
   - (2,3) <--> (3,3)
   - (0,3) <--> (1,3)
   - (1,2) <--> (1,3)
   - (2,1) <--> (3,1)
   - (2,0) <--> (1,0)
   - (0,2) <--> (1,2)

2. **Determine the entry and exit points**: 
   - Entry (origin): (0,0)
   - Exit (target): (3,3)

3. **Find a path using a search algorithm (e.g., BFS)**:
   - Start from (0,0).
   - Navigate through connected nodes, avoiding revisits, to reach (3,3).

Given the connections, a valid path can be deduced:

- Start at (0,0), we can move to (1,0) and (0,1).
- From (0,1), move to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move to (1,2).
- From (1,2), move to (1,3).
- From (1,3), move to (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (3,3) and reach the target.

**Path Verification**
- Check each step of the path to ensure it uses direct connections from the adjacency list.
- Ensure no step skips a connection or creates an unrealistic diagonal move.

Formatted output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

**Key considerations**:
- Ensure the path’s continuity by moving between directly connected nodes.
- Validate that all movements happen between adjacent coordinates to obey the maze’s constraints. Revisiting the adjacency list confirms the validity of each step in the proposed path. This path doesn't cross any walls and adheres to the connectivity constraints established by the given adjacency list.
