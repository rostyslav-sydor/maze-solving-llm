To solve the maze described by the adjacency list, we can model it as a graph where each pair of coordinates represents a node and edges are indicated by `<-->` symbols connecting two nodes. We need to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

1. **Interpreting the adjacency list as a graph**:
   - Parse the adjacency list to map each node (coordinate) with its connected nodes. 
   - For instance, `(0,2)` is connected to both `(0,1)` and `(0,3)`, making edges `{(0,2), (0,1)}` and `{(0,2), (0,3)}`.

2. **Setting origin and target**:
   - From the tokens `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>`, we know that the origin is `(0,0)`.
   - From the tokens `<TARGET_START>` and `<TARGET_END>`, we identify that the target is `(3,3)`.

3. **Finding the shortest path**:
   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the shortest path from the origin to the target within the graph. BFS is suitable for unweighted graphs like this one, ensuring we get the shortest path based on the number of moves.
   - Starting from (0,0), explore all adjacent nodes, then move to those nodes and explore their adjacent nodes, ensuring not to revisit any node.

4. **Constructing the solution**:
   - Begin BFS from `(0,0)`. We know it's directly connected to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
   - Continue expanding: from `(0,1)` to `(0,0)`, `(0,2)`; from `(1,0)` to `(1,1)`, `(2,0)`, etc.
   - This expansion continues until reaching `(3,3)`.

5. **Verify the path**:
   - Ensure each step from the BFS solution maintains adjacency defined by the list.
   - Verify the path does not include moving between any coordinate pairs not explicitly connected by `<-->` in the adjacency description, ensuring no walls are crossed and only adjacent cells are used.

The solution derived using this approach would reflect a series of steps (passing through adjacent cells without crossing walls) from the mazeâ€™s entry `(0,0)` to the exit `(3,3)`.

**Outputting the solution**:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Above, we have traced path steps ensuring each moves to an immediately adjacent node per the original adjacency list. No steps involve leaps or crossings that violate the adjacency connections, ensuring the path is valid and meets the maze's setup rules.
