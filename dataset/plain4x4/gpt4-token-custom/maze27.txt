To solve the maze, I'll use the adjacency list provided to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm which is a common method for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze. The adjacency list gives direct connections between points in the maze, ensuring that any step taken during BFS is legal (does not cross the walls).

**Steps for solving the maze:**

1. **Construct the graph:** Convert the given adjacency list into a graph, represented as a dictionary where keys are nodes (coordinates) and values are lists of directly connected neighboring nodes.

2. **BFS Algorithm:**
   - Initialize a queue with the origin and start exploring all paths from there.
   - For each node, explore its neighbors. Check if each neighbor has been visited; if not, mark it as visited, and add it to the queue. Also, keep track of each node's parent (the node from which it was discovered).
   - This continues until either all nodes are visited or the target is reached.

3. **Extract the path:** Once the target is found, trace the path back from the target node to the origin using the parent links.

**Connecting the nodes from the adjacency list:**

- From the list: 
   - (1,2) connects to (2,2), (1,3)
   - (2,2) connects to (3,2), (1,2)
   - (1,0) connects to (0,0), (2,0)
   - (1,3) connects to (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)
   - And similarly for other connections...

**Performing BFS and tracing the path:**

- Start at (0,0), the origin.
- Using BFS, explore all accessible neighbors considering there is no wall between them as per the adjacency.
- Once reaching each node, store where it was reached from (its parent).
- Upon reaching target (3,3), trace back using parent nodes to get the full path.

**Resulting Path:**

1. Start BFS from: (0,0)
   - Explore and visit (1,0) and log (0,0) as its parent.
2. From (1,0) go to:
   - (2,0), parent: (1,0)
3. From (2,0) go to:
   - (3,0), parent: (2,0)
4. From (3,0) go to:
   - (3,1), parent: (3,0)
5. From (3,1) go to:
   - (3,2), parent: (3,1)
6. From (3,2) go to:
   - (3,3), parent: (3,2) (Target found!)
7. Backtrack to get the full path by following parent links from (3,3) to (0,0).

**Final Path:** (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

**Verification:**
Each step moves to a directly connected neighbor as confirmed by examining the adjacency list, which means the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.

**Output Representation:**

<Path start> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path end>
