To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, follow these steps:

1. **Interpret the Adjacency List:**
   - The adjacency list specifies connections between cells in pairs, implying these pairs are directly reachable from each other without crossing any boundaries.

2. **Construct the Graph:**
   - Maps each cell (vertex) to its directly connected neighbors.
  
3. **Identify Entry and Exit:**
   - **Origin**: (0,0)
   - **Target**: (3,3)

4. **Search for the Path:**
   - Use a graph search algorithm (like BFS - Breadth-First Search) to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3).

5. **BFS Process Explanation:**
   - Initialize with the start node (0,0), and explore all connected nodes layer by layer.
   - Continue until the target node (3,3) is reached or all possible paths are explored.
   - Track parent nodes to reconstruct the path once (3,3) is found.

6. **Reconstruct the Path:**
   - Starting from the target (3,3), trace back using the parent-child relationship established during BFS until reaching the origin (0,0).

7. **Validate the Path:**
   - Ensure every step in the path is present in the adjacency list representing valid movements between nodes.

**Result**:
Starting BFS at (0,0) and exploring connections, we assess movements to reachable cells:
- Directly from (0,0) to (0,1), then (0,2), (0,3).
- Each move strictly follows the list of connections, proving valid transitions.
- From (0,3), neighboring (1,3) is reached. Then move from (1,3) to (2,3) and finally from (2,3) to (3,3).

Final path fitting the criteria and traced using valid transitions is:

<Path_Start> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <Path_End>

**Checking:**
- Each pair in the path list sequentially matches directly connected pairs in the original adjacency list, signifying no wall crossings and the usage of adjacent cells only.
