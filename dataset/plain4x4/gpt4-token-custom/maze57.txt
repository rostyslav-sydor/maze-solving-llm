To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), the problem can be addressed using a graph traversal technique such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).

First, let's construct the adjacency list:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0) and (1,1)
- (2,0) connects to (2,1)
- (0,1) connects to (1,1) and (0,2)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1)
- (2,1) connects to (3,1)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (2,2) connects to (3,2) and (1,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (1,2) connects to (2,2)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (3,3)
- (0,2) connects to (0,3)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2) and (2,1)
- (3,3) connects only to (3,2) and (2,3)

From the maze structure and connections, we can start from (0,0) and trace possible paths, ensuring that each step proceeds to an adjacent space that is directly connected as per the adjacency list.

Here's the step-by-step judgment for pathfinding:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. From (0,0), move to (1,0) (direct connection).
3. From (1,0), move to (2,0) (direct connection).
4. From (2,0), move to (2,1) (direct connection).
5. From (2,1), move to (3,1) (direct connection).
6. From (3,1), move to (3,2) (direct connection).
7. From (3,2), move to (3,3) (direct connection).

Thus, the path is successfully constructed using directly connected steps without crossing any walls, and only adjacent cells are used in each move. The proposed solution, based on the adjacency list without backtracking, is straightforward and verifiable.

Final path representation:   
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path adheres to the connectivity rules defined in the adjacency list and reaches the target location successfully.
