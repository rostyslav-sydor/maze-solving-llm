<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. The given maze starts with the entry point at (0,0) and the exit point at (3,3). The connections between the nodes (cells) are provided in the adjacency list form.

2. Analyzing the list of connections:
   - (0,0) is connected to (0,1) and (1,0)
   - Continuing from (0,1), the path can go to (0,2).
   - From (0,2), next is (1,2) since there is a direct link.
   - Proceeding from (1,2), we can go to (1,3) because it's connected.
   - From (1,3), we move to (2,3) based on the link provided.
   - Finally, from (2,3), we reach the exit at (3,3).

3. **Check for Valid Paths and Wall Crossings:**
   - All steps in the path use linked nodes in the adjacency list.
   - There are no diagonal moves; all moves are to immediate adjacent cells either horizontally or vertically which satisfy the conditions given within a standard maze.

In conclusion, this path is valid within the constraints of the adjacency relationships given by the maze, confirming that the pathway does not cross any walls and only travels through adjacent cells.
