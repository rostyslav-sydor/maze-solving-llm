To find the solution to the given maze, we must first understand its structure and then determine a path from the entry point (origin) to the exit point (target). Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: Translate the adjacency list into a graph where each tuple (x, y) represents a node and an edge exists between nodes that are directly connected.

2. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph from the origin to the target. BFS is optimal for unweighted graphs, which suits our situation where each move from one node to the adjacent node has equal cost.

3. **Maze Construction**:
   - Given nodes and their direct connections (edges) form:
     - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
     - (3,3) <--> (2,3)
     - (1,3) <--> (2,3)
     - ...
     - (0,1) <--> (1,1)

   - These connections suggest you can only move between directly connected nodes, ensuring movement adheres to the maze structure.

4. **Execution**:
   - **Start Point**: (0,0)
   - **End Point**: (3,3)

5. **Algorithm Application**:
   - Use BFS from (0,0) checking each neighbor:
     - From (0,0) go to (1,0) or (0,1).
     - Continue using BFS, expanding to all possible paths. 
     - Track the path.

6. **Construct Paths Using BFS**:
   - Begin at (0,0), explore neighbors (0,1) and (1,0).
   - From (0,1), move on to (1,1).
   - From (1,1), explore more until reaching (3,3) while avoiding backtracking or moves that aren't allowed per adjacencies.

7. **Final Path Verification**:
   - Validate that at each step, the moves are between adjacent cells and check if the path doesn't cross any walls by referencing the adjacency list.

8. **Output**:
   Assuming my BFS analysis and proper connectivity based on the provided adjacency list:

   `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path moves sequentially through adjacent nodes, adhering to the adjacency list provided, and ensures a successful reach from the start point (0,0) to the endpoint (3,3) without violating any maze walls or making non-adjacent moves.
