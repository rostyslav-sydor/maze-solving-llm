<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning Behind the Solution:**

1. **Starting Point:** The entry point given is at (0,0).

2. **End Point:** The exit point specified is at (3,3). 

3. **Path Construction:**
   - From the initial point (0,0), one can move to (0,1) as there's a direct link in the adjacency list.
   - Then from (0,1) to (0,2) as there’s a link according to the adjacency list.
   - After reaching (0,2), we can move to (0,3) following another available path.
   - From (0,3), the next available move based on the adjacency list is to (1,3).
   - Continuing from (1,3) leads us to (2,3) next.
   - The final movement from (2,3) to (3,3) is also available based on the connections outlined.
   
4. **Wall and Adjacency Compliance:**
   - Each consecutive pair in the listed solution directly connects in the adjacency list, ensuring that we're not crossing any unconnected walls.
   - All listed segments show direct connectivity and no shown segments skip or jump any cells, ensuring all cells used in the path are adjacent as required by the maze rules.

5. **Solution Verification:**
   - The final point (3,3) is reached using valid movements, and the path follows the required start and end points respectively.
   - All pairs are sequentially connected per the adjacency list, circumventing any blocked or non-adjacent cells, affirming the route is correct based on the given adjacency list.

This systematic traversal confirms the path's accuracy within the maze’s constraints.
