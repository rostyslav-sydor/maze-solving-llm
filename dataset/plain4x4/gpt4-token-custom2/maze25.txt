To solve the maze, we can extract the adjacency list provided between <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END>, and determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The BFS approach ensures that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as this maze, where each step from one node to another is effectively of equal distance.

### Parsing the Adjacency List
The maze structure given in your message has edges between nodes, forming a graph. We will parse these connections to build the adjacency list.

### BFS Implementation
Starting from the origin, we'll explore all adjacent nodes level-wise (breadth-first), marking nodes as visited to prevent revisiting and using a queue to manage the order of node exploration.

### Backtracking for the Path
After reaching the target, backtrack from the target to the origin via the parents to determine the exact path.

### Result Formatting
The extracted path will be formatted as specified with each coordinate listed consecutively from start to finish.

### Detailed Computation
1. From starting point (0,0), look at possible movements based on adjacency list.
2. Queue the valid movements (considering boundaries and visited status).
3. Continue this process until you find (3,3) or all possible paths are explored.
4. Retrace your steps from (3,3) back to (0,0) using the recorded parent for each node visited.

Resulting path as determined by BFS from origin (0,0) to destination (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures continuous logical movement from start to end using available connections while navigating the maze optimally.
