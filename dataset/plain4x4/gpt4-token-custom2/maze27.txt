To solve the maze described with the given adjacency list and find a path from the origin to the target, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS ensures that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze.

First, let's parse the adjacency list into a usable graph structure and identify the entry and exit points.

**Parsed Adjacency List**:
```
{
    (1,2): [(2,2)],
    (2,2): [(1,2), (3,2)],
    (3,3): [(2,3)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)],
    (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3), (0,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (0,1): [(0,2), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)],
    (3,1): [(3,2), (2,1)],
    (0,3): [(1,3)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0)],
    (1,1): [(0,1), (2,1)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (2,2)],
    (2,1): [(3,1), (1,1)]
}
```
**Origin**: (0,0)  
**Target**: (3,3)

We will initialize a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited nodes. Starting at the origin, we will explore all possible paths using the edges defined in the graph, marking nodes as visited to prevent revisiting and looping.

**Algorithm Implementation**:
1. Initialize the queue with the origin point (0,0) and set it as visited.
2. Continue processing until the queue is empty or the target (3,3) is found.
3. For each node, explore its neighbors.
4. Keep track of the path using a predecessor map.
5. When the target is reached, backtrace from the target to the origin using the predecessor map to get the path.

**Steps**:
- (0,0) to (1,0)
- (1,0) to (2,0)
- (2,0) to (3,0)
- (3,0) to (3,1)
- (3,1) to (3,2)
- (3,2) to (3,3)

These steps form the path between the origin and target using BFS on the adjacency list.

**Output**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
