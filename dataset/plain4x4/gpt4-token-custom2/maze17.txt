Analyzing the provided maze adjacency list for a path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3), we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for its simplicity and efficiency in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one:

We'll represent the graph adjacency as:
```
(1,2) <-> (1,3)
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
(3,3) <-> (3,2)
(0,1) <-> (1,1)
(0,0) <-> (1,0)
(2,0) <-> (1,0)
(1,2) <-> (2,2)
(0,2) <-> (0,1)
(2,0) <-> (3,0)
(2,1) <-> (2,0)
(3,3) <-> (2,3)
(2,2) <-> (2,3)
(1,3) <-> (0,3)
(3,1) <-> (3,0)
(0,3) <-> (0,2)
```
Origin is (0,0) and target is (3,3).

Using BFS, we perform the following steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start from the origin (0,0).
   - Enqueue it, marking the node as visited.

2. **Exploring Neighbors:**
   - Use a queue to explore all reachable nodes in the graph level-by-level:

Iteration through BFS:
- Start at (0,0). Neighbors: (1,0)
  - Enqueue (1,0)
- From (1,0), Neighbors: (2,0)
  - Enqueue (2,0)
- From (2,0), Neighbors: (3,0), (2,1)
  - Enqueue (3,0)
  - Enqueue (2,1)
- From (3,0), Neighbors: (3,1)
  - Enqueue (3,1)
- From (2,1), Neighbors: No new neighbors
- From (3,1), Neighbors: (3,2), (2,1)
  - Enqueue (3,2)
- From (3,2), Neighbors: (3,3)
  - Enqueue (3,3)

3. **Reaching Target:**
   - Path is found when we reach (3,3).
   
Backtracking through BFS for constructing the path:
- Start from (3,3) backtracked to (3,2)
- From (3,2) backtracked to (3,1)
- From (3,1) backtracked to (3,0)
- From (3,0) backtracked to (2,0)
- From (2,0) backtracked to (1,0)
- From (1,0) backtracked to (0,0)

Therefore, assembling the complete path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
