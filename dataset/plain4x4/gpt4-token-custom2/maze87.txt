To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format with Breadth-First Search (BFS), let's proceed by parsing the adjacency list and then finding a path from the origin to the target.

### Step 1: Parse the adjacency list
We need to represent the connections in a way that facilitates traversal.
```
Maze connections:
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)
```

### Step 2: Create the graph as an adjacency list
```python
maze_graph = {
    (0,0): [(0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)],
    (0,3): [(0,2)],
    (1,0): [(2,0)],
    (1,1): [(0,1), (1,2)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (0,2), (1,1)],
    (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (1,0)],
    (2,1): [(2,2), (3,1)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (3,2)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
    (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (2,1)],
    (3,2): [(2,2), (3,3)],
    (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)]
}
```

### Step 3: Implement BFS to find the path
Here's how BFS would be structured, finding the path from (0,0) to (3,3):
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_path(graph, start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    seen = set()
    seen.add(start)

    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()

        if current == goal:
            return path

        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in seen:
                seen.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

path = bfs_path(maze_graph, (0,0), (3,3))
```
### Step 4: Output the path
```python
print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(map(str, path)), "<PATH_END>")
```
When we run this BFS and path generation, depending on the entry implemented, the path would be:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This sequence provides an efficient passage from the start to finish within the constraints of the adjacency list.
