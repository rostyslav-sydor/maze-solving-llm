To solve the maze described by the adjacency list and find the path from the origin to the target, I will perform a breadth-first search (BFS). This search strategy ensures finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this maze, provided the adjacency relationships correctly reflect possible movements.

### Extract Adjacency Information

First, we build graph connections between maze cells based on the adjacency list provided. Based on the adjacency list:

```
(2,2) <--> (2,3); (2,2) <--> (2,1); (2,0) <--> (3,0); (0,1) <--> (0,2); (3,1) <--> (3,0);
(0,1) <--> (0,0); (1,1) <--> (2,1); (1,1) <--> (1,2); (1,0) <--> (0,0); (0,3) <--> (1,3);
(2,1) <--> (2,0); (3,2) <--> (3,1); (0,2) <--> (0,3); (1,3) <--> (2,3); (3,2) <--> (3,3);
```

### Represent the Graph

For ease of understanding, each coordinate pair (x,y) represents a node in the graph, and the connections show the edges.

### Perform BFS to find the shortest path

We start at (0,0) and want to reach (3,3). Here's the step-by-step BFS:

1. Initialize the queue with the start node (0,0).
2. Dequeue (0,0) and enqueue its direct neighbors (if not visited). In this case, (0,0) connects to (0,1) and (1,0).
3. Dequeue (0,1) and enqueue its neighbors (0,2).
4. Dequeue (1,0), enqueue nothing new as it reconnects with (0,0).
5. Dequeue (0,2), enqueue its neighbors (0,3).
6. Dequeue (0,3), enqueue its neighbor (1,3).
7. Dequeue (1,3), enqueue its neighbor (2,3).
8. Dequeue (2,3), enqueue its neighbor (2,2) and (3,3) (thus, reaching the target node).
9. Steps continue for other queues revisiting already visited nodes until the target is reached.

### Resultant Path

We track each node's predecessor. By backtracking from the target (3,3) using predecessors, we extract the visited path:

```
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```

Which provides a viable solution to traverse from the entry to the exit of the maze.

### Formatted Output:

Here's the answer in the required format:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
