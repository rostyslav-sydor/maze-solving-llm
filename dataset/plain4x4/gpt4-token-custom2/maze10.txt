To solve the maze provided, we'll construct a graph from the adjacency list and use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

First, let's parse the adjacency list and reconstruct the graph:

```
(1,1) <--> (0,1)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(2,0) <--> (2,1)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
```

Graph with nodes connected as above:
- Entry point: (0,0)
- Exit point: (3,3)

To find a path from (0,0) to (3,3):
1. Start BFS from (0,0).
2. Visit each connected node while ensuring nodes are visited only once.
3. Track the path using a predecessor mapping.

Starting BFS traversal:
1. From (0,0) to (1,0)
2. From (1,0) to (2,0)
3. From (2,0) to (3,0)
4. From (3,0) to (3,1)
5. From (3,1) to (3,2)
6. From (3,2) to (3,3) - DESTINATION REACHED.

Each transition is feasible based on the adjacency list provided. Let us confirm by tracing the path back from (3,3) to (0,0) using the connections:

Path Construction:
- (3,3) to (3,2) via direct connection.
- (3,2) to (3,1) also directly connected.
- (3,1) to (3,0) directly connected.
- (3,0) to (2,0) directly connected.
- (2,0) to (1,0) directly connected.
- (1,0) to (0,0) directly connected.

The path found traces correctly, thus:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path respects the adjacency list given and connects the origin to the target, passing through all intermediary nodes listed in the order found by BFS, ensuring minimal steps.
