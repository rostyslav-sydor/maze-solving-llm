To solve the maze presented in the latest adjacency list, we again need to find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Given the structure of the adjacency list, let's outline a possible path utilizing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach for clarity and to ensure we get the shortest path possible.

**Step-by-Step BFS Solution:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore all connected nodes, marking nodes as visited.
2. From (0,0), move to (1,0) and then to (2,0).
3. Continue from (2,0) to (3,0).
4. From (3,0), proceed to (3,1) and then to (3,2).
5. Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3).

We establish the path by observing the connections and ensuring every movement is valid as per the adjacency list:

- (0,0) is connected to (1,0).
- (1,0) is further connected to (2,0).
- (2,0) is further connected to (3,0) directly.
- From (3,0), move horizontally to (3,1) and from (3,1) to (3,2).
- Lastly, (3,2) connects directly to (3,3), our target.

Thus, the path that traces from the origin to the target without backtracking, using valid adjacencies from the list provided, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This straightforward path adheres to the direct connections depicted in the adjacency list and provides an efficient route through the maze.
