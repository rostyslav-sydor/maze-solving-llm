To solve the maze provided in the question, we need to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list which represents possible movements between cells in the maze. We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path because it efficiently explores all possible routes from the source before moving deeper, ensuring the first time it reaches the target, it will be via the shortest path.

The adjacency list is:
```
(2,1) <--> (1,1) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ; 
(1,3) <--> (2,3) ; 
(0,3) <--> (1,3) ; 
(2,1) <--> (2,0) ; 
(1,0) <--> (0,0) ; 
(1,2) <--> (0,2) ; 
(3,3) <--> (2,3) ; 
(0,1) <--> (0,0) ; 
(3,0) <--> (2,0) ; 
(2,2) <--> (2,3) ; 
(2,2) <--> (3,2) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) ; 
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ; 
(0,1) <--> (0,2) ; 
```

**BFS Algorithm:**
1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Create a queue for BFS and enqueue the first node and an empty path.
3. While the queue isn't empty:
   - Dequeue an element.
   - Mark the node as visited.
   - Check if it's the target; if so, return the path.
   - Enqueue all connected, unvisited nodes, appending them to the path.

**Geneate Adjacency Map from List:**
```python
maze_graph = {
    (2, 1): [(1, 1), (2, 0)],
    (3, 1): [(3, 0), (3, 2)],
    (1, 3): [(2, 3)],
    (0, 3): [(1, 3), (0, 2)],
    (2, 0): [(1, 0), (3, 0)],
    (1, 0): [(0, 0)],
    (1, 2): [(0, 2)],
    (3, 3): [(2, 3)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 0), (0, 2)],
    (2, 2): [(2, 3), (3, 2)],
    (0, 0): [(1, 0), (0, 1)],
    (0, 2): [(1, 2), (0, 3), (0, 1)]
}
```

**Executing BFS:**
Starting from (0,0), explore neighbors iteratively until reaching (3,3).

**Possible BFS Implementation Result:**
- From (0,0), we explore to (1,0).
- From (1,0), we can move to (2,0).
- From (2,0), move to either (2,1) or (3,0). However, we follow the path to (3,0).
- From (3,0), move to (3,1).
- From (3,1), explore to (3,2).
- From (3,2), go to (2,2).
- From (2,2), reach (2,3).
- From (2,3), reach (3,3) which is the target.

So the path would be:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This BFS traversal follows a feasible route based on accessible links between nodes, according to the adjacency list provided, ensuring every step leads towards the target without unnecessary detours, marking it as an efficient solution of the maze.
