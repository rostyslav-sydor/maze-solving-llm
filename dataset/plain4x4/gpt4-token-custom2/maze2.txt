Starting from the origin at (0,0) using the given adjacency list, we can leverage the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the target at (3,3). Here's how:

1) From (0,0), move right to (0,1).
2) From (0,1), move right to (0,2).
3) From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
4) From (1,2), move down to (2,2).
5) From (2,2), move down to (3,2).
6) From (3,2), move right to (3,3).

Checkpointing nodes and tracking the path as we proceed, the derived shortest path from the origin to the destination, according to the adjacency relationships provided, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
