To solve this maze, we will represent the adjacency list provided as a graph and use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Analyzing the given adjacency list, we generate the graph:

```
(1,0) <-> (2,0)
(0,2) <-> (0,1)
(2,3) <-> (2,2)
(2,1) <-> (2,2)
(1,1) <-> (0,1)
(3,2) <-> (3,3)
(2,3) <-> (3,3)
(1,3) <-> (0,3)
(1,0) <-> (1,1)
(2,0) <-> (3,0)
(0,1) <-> (0,0)
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
(0,2) <-> (0,3)
(1,2) <-> (1,3)
(3,0) <-> (3,1)
```

Using BFS, starting from the origin `(0,0)`, we can find the shortest path to `(3,3)` by following the edges and ensuring we track the path to be able to backtrack once the destination is reached.

1. Start at `(0,0)`, possible moves are to `(0,1)`
2. Move to `(0,1)`, from here, head to `(0,2)`
3. From `(0,2)`, move to `(0,3)`
4. At `(0,3)`, go to `(1,3)`
5. From `(1,3)`, proceed to `(1,2)`
6. Move from `(1,2)` to `(1,1)`
7. From `(1,1)`, go to `(1,0)`
8. Move from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`
9. Move to `(3,0)` from `(2,0)`
10. From `(3,0)` proceed to `(3,1)`
11. Move to `(3,2)` from `(3,1)`
12. Finally, from `(3,2)`, reach `(3,3)`.

Backtracking from `(3,3)`, the path found is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This forms the shortest path from the given origin to the target based on the provided maze structure.
