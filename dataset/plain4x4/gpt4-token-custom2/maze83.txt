To solve this maze, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Given the maze, we first convert the edges presented in the adjacency list to a usable form, specify the origin and target positions, and then proceed through the maze:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move right to (0,3).
5. Move down to (1,3).
6. Move down to (2,3).
7. Move right to (3,3), which is the target.

Let's break down the path into a sequence:

- **(0,0) to (0,1)**: This move is supported by the adjacency `(0,1) <--> (0,0)`.
- **(0,1) to (0,2)**: This is possible because of the adjacency `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`.
- **(0,2) to (0,3)**: Validated by `(0,3) <--> (0,2)`.
- **(0,3) to (1,3)**: Allows entry into `(0,3) <--> (1,3)`.
- **(1,3) to (2,3)**: Connected by `(1,3) <--> (2,3)`.
- **(2,3) to (3,3)**: Finally, the connection `(3,3) <--> (2,3)` allows us to reach the target.

Therefore, the shortest path through the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
