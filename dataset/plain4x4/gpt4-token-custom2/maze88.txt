To solve the maze provided, we begin at the origin (0,0) and aim to reach the target (3,3) using the shortest path. Based on the adjacency list provided, we create a graph, then use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the nodes systematically. BFS will help find the shortest path between the two points. 

Here are the adjacency lists for the graph parsed from the maze description:

1. (3,2) <--> (3,1)
2. (0,1) <--> (1,1)
3. (0,3) <--> (1,3)
4. (1,1) <--> (1,0)
5. (0,2) <--> (1,2)
6. (2,0) <--> (3,0)
7. (3,3) <--> (3,2)
8. (0,1) <--> (0,0)
9. (2,2) <--> (1,2)
10. (1,0) <--> (2,0)
11. (1,3) <--> (2,3)
12. (3,3) <--> (2,3)
13. (2,2) <--> (2,3)
14. (3,1) <--> (3,0)
15. (2,1) <--> (1,1)

From this, we establish the graph:

```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(0,1), (1,0)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(1,2)],
    (0,3): [(1,3)],
    (1,0): [(2,0), (1,1)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (2,1), (0,1)],
    (1,2): [(0,2), (2,2)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (1,0)],
    (2,1): [(1,1)],
    (2,2): [(1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,2), (3,0)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
}
```

Using BFS to find the shortest path:

```python
from queue import Queue

def bfs_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.put([start])
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)

    while not queue.empty():
        path = queue.get()
        node = path[-1]

        if node == end:
            return path

        for adjacent in graph.get(node, []):
            if adjacent not in visited:
                visited.add(adjacent)
                new_path = list(path)
                new_path.append(adjacent)
                queue.put(new_path)

    return None

start = (0,0)
end = (3,3)
path = bfs_path(graph, start, end)
```

Outputting the path in the required format involves mapping the coordinates to the specified format:

```python
stringified_path = f"<PATH_START> {' '.join(map(str, path))} <PATH_END>"
```

When executed, this code will find the shortest path in the maze between the origin (0,0) and target (3,3), showcasing the path taken:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence follows the connections defined in the adjacency list and represents the shortest route due to the properties of BFS in an unweighted graph.
