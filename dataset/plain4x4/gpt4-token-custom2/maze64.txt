Starting with the origin at (0,0), we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the nodes and find a path to the destination (3,3), using the provided adjacency list representation of the maze.

Here's how the BFS will generally work step-by-step for solving the maze:

1. Enqueue the start position (0,0) and mark as visited.
2. Dequeue from queue and check current position.
3. For all connected nodes (or adjacent cells) of the current node:
   - If a node is not visited, mark it, enqueue it, and note the parent node.
4. Repeat the steps until the queue is empty or the destination is found.
5. Once the destination node is found, backtrack from the destination to the origin using the recorded parents to get the path.

Following these steps and using the adjacency list from the provided input, implementation of BFS will give:

1. Starting at (0,0), we can move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), we can move to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), we can move to (2,2).
5. From (2,2), we can move to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), we can move to (3,3).

Backtracking now from (3,3) to (0,0) based on recorded predecessors, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path traverses through each coordinate as given by the valid connections in the adjacency list, ensuring each move is legal and connected accordingly as described originally.
