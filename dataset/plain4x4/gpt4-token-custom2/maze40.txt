To solve this maze, we need to first interpret the adjacency list and then use a graph traversal technique, like Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list provided in the query details connections between nodes in the maze, each node being a coordinate in a grid.

First, we'll interpret the given adjacency list and construct a bidirectional graph connecting nodes as provided.

### Interpretation of the Adjacency List
The adjacency list provided describes connections like:
- `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`
- `(1,3) <--> (0,3)`
- `(2,0) <--> (1,0)`
- ...and so forth.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) 
BFS is appropriate for unweighted graphs when we are looking for the shortest path. Each edge adds one to the path, and the first time we reach the target node will provide the shortest path due to the FIFO nature of the BFS queue.

### Implementation using Python-style Pseudocode:

Steps:
1. Parse the adjacency list and construct the graph as a dictionary of sets for quick lookup.
2. Initialize BFS with the queue starting at the origin.
3. Track visited nodes to prevent revisiting and looping.
4. On visiting each node, store the path to retrace steps back once the target is reached.

```python
def solve_maze(adj_list, origin, target):
    # Construct the graph
    graph = {}
    for connection in adj_list:
        node1, node2 = connection.strip().split(" <--> ")
        if node1 not in graph:
            graph[node1] = set()
        if node2 not in graph:
            graph[node2] = set()
        graph[node1].add(node2)
        graph[node2].add(node1)
    
    # BFS setup
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([(origin, [origin])])  # Queue of tuples (node, path)
    visited = set()
    
    # BFS
    while queue:
        current_node, path = queue.popleft()
        if current_node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current_node)
        if current_node == target:
            return path
        for neighbor in graph.get(current_node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    return []

# Example call with parsed adjacency list
adj_list_example = [
    "(2,1) <--> (1,1)", "(1,3) <--> (0,3)", "(2,0) <--> (1,0)", # ...
]
origin = "(0,0)"
target = "(3,3)"
path = solve_maze(adj_list_example, origin, target)

# Format the output
output = "<PATH_START> " + " ".join(path) + " <PATH_END>"
print(output)
```

### Conclusion:
To conclude, this code would be able to track the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` using BFS.  It will return it in the format specified within the `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens. Make sure to convert the `output` properly as the final Python implementation requires careful handling of string manipulations.
