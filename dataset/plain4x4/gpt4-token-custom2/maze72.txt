To find a solution for the maze represented in the adjacency list format, we need to implement a pathfinding algorithm that efficiently navigates from the origin point to the target point. Using BFS (Breadth-First Search) is suitable as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

First, let's construct the graph from the adjacency list given, then apply the BFS algorithm to determine the shortest path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

**Steps to Construct the Graph and Implement BFS:**

1. **Parse the adjacency list** to create a graph as a dictionary where each node (coordinate) contains a list of its adjacent nodes.

2. **Implement BFS** to locate the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:
   - Initialize a queue with the start node and mark it as visited.
   - For each node, explore all unvisited adjacent nodes, updating their visit status and predecessor.
   - Continue until the queue is empty or the target node is found.

3. **Construct the path** from the target back to the origin using the predecessors recorded during BFS traversal.

**Graph represented by parsing adjacency list:**
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

maze_graph = defaultdict(list)
raw_data = "(1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (2,2) <--> (2,3) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (0,2) <--> (1,2) ; (0,1) <--> (1,1) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1)"
connections = raw_data.split(" ; ")

for connection in connections:
    parts = connection.strip().split(" <--> ")
    node1 = tuple(map(int, parts[0].strip("()").split(",")))
    node2 = tuple(map(int, parts[1].strip("()").split(",")))
    maze_graph[node1].append(node2)
    maze_graph[node2].append(node1)

origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)

def bfs_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    predecessors = {start: None}

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == end:
            break
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
                predecessors[neighbor] = current

    path = []
    step = end
    while step is not None:
        path.insert(0, step)
        step = predecessors[step]

    return path

path = bfs_path(maze_graph, origin, target)
```

**Output the Path:**
```python
output_path = " ".join(str(item) for item in path)
print(f"<PATH_START> {output_path} <PATH_END>")
```

Execute the above Python script to get the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` based on the adjacency list provided. This will show the sequence of moves to solve the maze.
