To solve this maze, we'll use the adjacency list given in the provided input to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest possible path from the origin to the target in the maze. The BFS is suited for this task as it systematically explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, efficiently finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**Maze Graph:**
The adjacency list provides the connections between locations in the maze:
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)

**Origin and Target:**
- Origin (start) point: (0,0)
- Target (end) point: (3,3)

**BFS Algorithm Execution:**
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. First, move right to (0,1).
3. Then, move down to (1,1).
4. Move right to (1,2).
5. Continue down to (2,2).
6. Move down again to (3,2).
7. Finally, move right to the target (3,3).

This sequence is achieved by examining all direct neighbors to each node and using a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored. Once the target is reached or all possible paths are explored, the nodes are traced back from the target to the origin to determine the exact path taken, forming the shortest path solution.

**Solution Representation:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path provides the shortest route from (0,0) to (3,3) using the adjacency connections established earlier in the maze's graph structure.
