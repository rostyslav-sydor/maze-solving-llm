To solve the maze, I'll apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm once more, starting from the origin at (0,0) and aiming to reach the target at (3,3). This approach will help us find the shortest path through the maze. Let's decode the adjacency list to understand the connections and apply BFS.

Here's the adjacency list:

- (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (2,3) <-> (2,2)
- (2,1) <-> (2,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)

From the starting point (0,0):

1. Begin at (0,0), which directly connects to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3), which is the target.

Thus, walking through the BFS steps and tracing node connections from the adjacency list, we find the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path forms a consecutive chain from the entry to the exit without cycle, visiting each neighboring node exactly once as per BFS algorithm. This is the valid shortest path given the structure of the maze.
