To solve the maze starting from the origin (0,0) and reaching the target (3,3), we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. The adjacency list will be transformed into a more practical format, and we'll trace through the maze:

1. Parse the adjacency list and convert into a usable graph dictionary.
2. Implement BFS to traverse from (0,0) to (3,3).

**Parsed adjacency list:**
- (2,3) <-> (1,3), (3,3), (2,2)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1), (1,1), (2,0)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1), (2,2), (3,3)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0), (3,0), (2,1)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0), (2,0)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2), (0,0)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3), (3,3)
- (1,1) <-> (2,1)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2), (1,3)
- (0,0) <-> (0,1), (1,0)
- (2,2) <-> (2,3), (3,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1), (0,3), (1,2)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)

**Applying BFS:**
Starting node is (0,0). We define the graph as a dictionary `G` where each key is a node and values are lists of neighboring nodes.

Navigate through each node, using BFS:
1. From (0,0) to (1,0)
2. From (1,0) to (2,0)
3. From (2,0) to (3,0)
4. Continue from (3,0) to (3,1)
5. From (3,1) to (3,2)
6. From (3,2) to (3,3)

Upon arrival at (3,3), we backtrack to create the path sequence:

**Resulting Path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence shows the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using BFS in the graph representation of the maze.
