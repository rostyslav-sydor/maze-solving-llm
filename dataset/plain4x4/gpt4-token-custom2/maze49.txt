To solve the maze, we can follow a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to ensure the shortest path from the entry (origin) point to the exit (target) point. Let's extract the adjacency list from the provided tokens and execute the BFS:

**Extracted Adjacency List:**
- (1,2) linked with (1,1)
- (1,0) linked with (0,0)
- (3,3) linked with (3,2) and (2,3)
- (1,1) linked with (0,1)
- (3,2) linked with (2,2)
- (0,1) linked with (0,2)
- (3,0) linked with (3,1)
- (2,3) linked with (1,3)
- (2,1) linked with (3,1) and (1,1)
- (2,0) linked with (1,0) and (3,0)
- (0,3) linked with (1,3) and (0,2)

**Graph Representation:**
- (0,0) -> [(1,0)]
- (1,0) -> [(2,0)]
- (2,0) -> [(1,0), (3,0)]
- (3,0) -> [(2,0), (3,1)]
- (3,1) -> [(2,1), (3,0), (3,2)]
- (2,1) -> [(1,1), (3,1)]
- (1,1) -> [(1,2), (0,1), (2,1)]
- (0,1) -> [(1,1), (0,2)]
- (0,2) -> [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (0,3) -> [(1,3)]
- (1,3) -> [(2,3), (0,3)]
- (2,3) -> [(3,3), (1,3)]
- (3,3) -> [(3,2), (2,3)]
- (3,2) -> [(3,3), (2,2)]
- (2,2) -> [(3,2)]

**BFS Implementation:**
Initialize from the origin (0,0) and explore all connected nodes marking them as visited, and record the predecessor to trace back the path once reaching the destination (3,3).

Starting at (0,0) -> [(1,0)]

- Explore (1,0) -> [(2,0)]
- Explore (2,0) -> (1,0) already visited -> Explore (3,0)
- Explore (3,0) -> (2,0) already visited -> Explore (3,1)
- Explore (3,1) -> Explore (2,1) -> Explore (3,2)
- Explore (3,2) -> Explore (3,3) -> Found target

**Tracing the Path:**
- (3,3) from (3,2)
- (3,2) from (3,1)
- (3,1) from (3,0)
- (3,0) from (2,0)
- (2,0) from (1,0)
- (1,0) from (0,0)

So, the sequence of moves based on BFS exploration will be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This corresponds to the path outlined in the maze going from the start at the upper-left corner to the end at the lower-right corner.
