To find the solution for this maze, we must first interpret the adjacency list and then use a pathfinding algorithm such as BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find a valid path from the starting point (origin) to the destination (target). Let's execute this step-by-step:

1. Parse the adjacency list to establish the connections between the nodes:
   - Establish each node (e.g., (1,3), (2,3)) and the edges or connections between them as specified.

2. Implement BFS to find the shortest path:
   - Start at the origin (0,0), mark as visited, and explore all connected nodes.
   - Queue each neighbor until reaching the target (3,3), keeping track of the paths for backtracking to retrieve the full path.

Given the provided adjacency list, let's outline the BFS traversals:

Start at (0,0):
- Neighbors: (0,1), (1,0)

Process (0,1):
- Neighbors: (0,0), (0,2)

Process (1,0):
- Neighbors: (0,0), (1,1), (2,0)

Process (0,2):
- Neighbors: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2)

Process (1,1):
- Neighbors: (1,0), (2,1)

Process (2,0):
- Neighbors: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1)

Process (0,3):
- Neighbors: (0,2), (1,3)

Process (2,1):
- Neighbors: (1,1), (2,0), (3,1)

Process (3,0):
- Neighbors: (2,0), (3,1)

Process (1,3):
- Neighbors: (0,3), (1,2), (2,3)

Process (3,1):
- Neighbors: (2,1), (3,0), (3,2)

Process (1,2):
- Neighbors: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)

Process (2,2):
- Neighbors: (2,3), (3,2), (1,2)

Process (2,3):
- Neighbors: (1,3), (2,2), (3,3)

Process (3,2):
- Neighbors: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2)

Finally, reach (3,3):
- This node has neighbors that link back to previous nodes which finalize the path to the goal.

Using the above BFS pathway exploration, our solution for the maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path has been deduced by carefully ensuring that every move accesses a directly linked neighbor based upon the maze's adjacency list.
