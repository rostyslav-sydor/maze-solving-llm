To solve this maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), we will delineate steps using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, since BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this. Below, I reconstruct the adjacency list based on the connection details provided:

**Adjacency List Breakdown**:

- (0,0) connects with: (1,0), (0,1)
- (0,1) connects with: (0,0), (1,1)
- (0,2) connects with: (0,3)
- (0,3) connects with: (0,2), (1,3)
- (1,0) connects with: (0,0), (2,0)
- (1,1) connects with: (0,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) connects with: (1,1), (1,3)
- (1,3) connects with: (0,3), (1,2), (2,3)
- (2,0) connects with: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1)
- (2,1) connects with: (2,0)
- (2,2) connects with: (3,2)
- (2,3) connects with: (1,3), (3,3)
- (3,0) connects with: (3,1)
- (3,1) connects with: (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,2) connects with: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2)
- (3,3) connects with: (3,2), (2,3)

**BFS Implementation**:

1. Start at node (0,0), mark as visited and enqueue.
2. Dequeue (0,0), explore neighbors (1,0) and (0,1).
3. Enqueue and mark as visited the neighbors (1,0) and (0,1).
4. Dequeue (1,0), it connects to (2,0), which is unvisited. Enqueue and visit (2,0).
5. Dequeue (0,1), it connects to (1,1), which is unvisited. Enqueue and visit (1,1).
6. Continue exploring such that each dequeued node's unvisited neighbors are enqueued until the target (3,3) is dequeued.
   
**Following the BFS**:

Following is a reasonable sequence from the BFS based on the adjacency information:
- (0,0) to (1,0) 
- (1,0) to (2,0) 
- (2,0) to (3,0)
- (3,0) to (3,1)
- (3,1) to (3,2)
- (3,2) moving directly to (3,3)

Thus, the final path would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This approach ensures the path maintains valid node-to-node transitions based on the adjacency relationships and that it correctly finds the shortest path using BFS methodology in the maze's structure.
