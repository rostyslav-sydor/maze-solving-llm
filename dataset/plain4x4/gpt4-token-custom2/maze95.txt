To find the solution for the maze with the given adjacency list, I will first construct the graph from the adjacency list description and then use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Graph Construction:**

From the adjacency list we have:

- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)

**BFS Approach:**

Since BFS explores nodes layer by layer and we only need to find a path from the origin to the target, we use BFS to ensure the shortest path.

**Procedure:**

1. Start from origin (0,0).
2. Move to adjacent nodes based on the adjacency list.
3. Continue until the target (3,3) is reached or all possibilities are explored.

Following the adjacency relations and navigating the maze:

1. From (0,0) you can go to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) you can go to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) you can go to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) you can go to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) you can go to (2,3).
6. From (2,3) you can go to (3,3), which is the target.

**Result path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path provides a valid sequence from the start to the finish within the maze's structure and connections.
