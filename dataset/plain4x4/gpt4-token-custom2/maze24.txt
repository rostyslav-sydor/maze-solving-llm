To solve the maze in this configuration, we first need to convert the adjacency list into a usable graph data structure. Once the graph is constructed, we can apply a breadth-first search (BFS) for finding the shortest path from the origin to the target. Given the adjacency list and start/end coordinates, we'll parse the information, build the graph, perform the BFS, and trace the path back from the target to the origin.

Here are the steps in detail:

1. **Parse the maze representation** as an adjacency list.
2. **Build the graph** in a usable format such as a dictionary of sets or lists.
3. **Implement BFS** to find the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.
4. **Trace and print the path** from the BFS output in the specified format.

Let's fill out the solution:

**Step 1: Parse the adjacency information**
   This leads to the graph that would be built using the information from <ADJLIST_START> to <ADJLIST_END>.

**Step 2: Build the graph using the parsed adjacency information**
   This graph will be a dictionary where each key is a coordinate tuple and each key's value is a set of tuples representing direct neighbors.

**Step 3: Implement BFS for the shortest path**
   Starting from (0,0), each coordinate explores its neighbors, maintaining a queue for processing and a set for visited nodes, and records the predecessor of each node for path tracing.

**Step 4: Run BFS and trace back the path from (3,3) to (0,0)**

Given the above steps, the solution to the maze, using the nodes and their connections, is derived and presented below:

1) Start from (0,0) and move right to (0,1)
2) Move right from (0,1) to (1,1)
3) Move right from (1,1) to (1,2)
4) Move right from (1,2) to (1,3)
5) Move right from (1,3) to (2,3)
6) Move right from (2,3) to (3,3)

Therefore, the path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is the shortest path based on the graph's connections and BFS algorithm ensuring the shortest traversal in an unweighted graph setting. This output is computed assuming the adjacency list is appropriately constructed without missing links and fully reflective of all possible legal moves in the maze.
