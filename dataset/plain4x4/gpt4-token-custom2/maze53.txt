To find a path through the maze described by the adjacency list from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable as it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Parsing the adjacency list to create the maze graph, we get:
1. (0,3) <--> (1,3)
2. (3,1) <--> (3,2)
3. (2,2) <--> (2,1)
4. (0,0) <--> (1,0)
5. (2,3) <--> (3,3)
6. (2,3) <--> (1,3)
7. (3,1) <--> (3,0)
8. (0,2) <--> (1,2)
9. (2,0) <--> (3,0)
10. (2,0) <--> (1,0)
11. (3,2) <--> (2,2)
12. (0,1) <--> (0,2)
13. (1,2) <--> (1,1)
14. (2,2) <--> (2,3)
15. (1,1) <--> (1,0)

Next, let's construct a graph in Python-like pseudocode:
```python
maze_graph = {
    (0,3): [(1,3)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3)],
    (3,1): [(3,2), (3,0)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (2,3), (3,2)],
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (2,3): [(3,3), (1,3), (2,2)],
    (3,3): [(2,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (0,2): [(1,2), (0,1)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (1,0)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0), (1,1)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (2,2)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (1,2), (2,2)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (0,2), (1,1)]
}

origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)
```

With BFS initialized, let's proceed to find the shortest path:
1. Start at the origin, (0,0).
2. Possible next coordinates are hosting an open pathway: (1,0).
3. From (1,0), we can go to (2,0) or back to (0,0), or move to (1,1).
4. Continuing this path from (2,0) can take us to (3,0).
5. From (3,0), go to (3,1).
6. Move from (3,1) to (3,2), then to (3,3), the target.

The pathway found through BFS becomes:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path efficiently matches the shortest route from the start to the destination based on the defined adjacency list.
