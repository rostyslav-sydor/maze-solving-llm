Starting from the origin at (0,0) and aiming for the destination at (3,3), we will apply a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to trace the shortest path through the maze, given the adjacency representation. The BFS considers all immediate neighbors of a node, ensuring no cycles due to the nature of the algorithm, until all possible paths are explored, marking each node as visited once processed.

Following through nodes step-by-step:
1. From (0,0), it can go to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), it can go to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), it branches to (0,3).
4. Continue from (0,3) to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), proceed to (2,3).
6. Following up from (2,3) to (3,3).

This path was determined upon constructing a BFS tree, where we trace each level based on position proximity. Here's the path laid out from start to target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
