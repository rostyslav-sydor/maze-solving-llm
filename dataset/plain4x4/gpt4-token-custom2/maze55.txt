To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list and find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we'll perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suited for this task as it explores the nearest neighbors first and guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Steps to Construct Graph:
1. Parse the adjacency list to create a graph representation.
2. Use a queue for BFS to explore the nodes level-wise and mark nodes as visited.
3. Implement path tracking to trace back the route once the target node is reached.

### Implementing BFS Pathfinding:
I will simplify the BFS implementation below while theoretically ensuring we construct and traverse the graph correctly from the given data.

#### Adjacency List:
```
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(2,2) <--> (2,1)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
```
#### BFS Algorithm:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Place the origin in a queue and mark it as visited.
3. Explore each direction possible from every node until the queue is empty.

Given the setup, let's derive the BFS path:

- From (0,0), we can move directly to (0,1) and (1,0)
- Progressing to (1,0) leads us to (2,0) and (1,1)
- Path (2,0) facilitates movement to (3,0)
- Continue from (3,0) to (3,1)
- Moving from (3,1) leads to (3,2) and connects back to (2,1)
- (3,2) directly links to the target (3,3)
  
Hence, from these BFS explorations and connections outlined in the adjacency list, our path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:

**Solution:** 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequence provides one of the possible correct paths using the information given and assuming a correct interpretation and full visualization of all connections in the adjacency list. There might be other paths available, but this sequence should ideally present a valid shortest path based on problem setup constraints and BFS mechanics.
