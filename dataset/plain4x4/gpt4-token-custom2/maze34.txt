To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). This technique works perfectly on unweighted graphs like this maze, as it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Below is the step-by-step application of BFS to navigate through the maze:

**Step 1: Parse the adjacency list.**  
We first interpret the adjacency list into a usable format like a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes:
```
{
    (0,0): [(1,0), (0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
    (0,2): [(0,3), (0,1)],
    (0,3): [(1,3), (0,2)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (1,1)],
    (1,1): [(2,1), (1,0)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (2,2)],
    (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3), (0,3)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(3,1), (2,0), (1,1)],
    (2,2): [(3,2), (2,3), (1,2)],
    (2,3): [(3,3), (2,2), (1,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (3,3), (2,2)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
}
```

**Step 2: Conduct BFS to find the shortest path.**  
Starting at the origin (0,0), we explore its neighbors [(1,0), (0,1)], enqueuing them with a reference to their predecessor and mark them visited. We continuously dequeue the front entry, inspect and enqueue its unvisited neighbors until we reach the target or exhaust all paths. 

**Execution:**
- Starting from (0,0), move to (1,0).
- From (1,0), move to (1,1).
- From (1,1), move to (2,1).
- From (2,1), move to (3,1).
- From (3,1), move to (3,2).
- Finally, from (3,2), move to (3,3).

**Step 3: Trace back the path from target to origin.**  
Once we reach the target (3,3), we trace back using the predecessors to derive the full path from the origin to the target.

**Solution Output**:  
The shortest path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3) is derived from the iterative BFS process:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
