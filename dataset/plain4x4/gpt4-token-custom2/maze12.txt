To solve the maze defined by the adjacency list and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we'll implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS):

**Graph Representation and BFS Algorithm:**

1. **Parse the Adjacency List**:
   Extract edges from the adjacency list description to construct an undirected graph. The maze structure is represented as linked coordinates.

2. **Initialize BFS**:
   Start from the origin (0,0) and use a queue to manage nodes to explore, with an additional map/dictionary to track visited nodes and their predecessors for path reconstruction.

3. **Execute BFS**:
   For each node, add its neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited, marking them as visited and noting how we reached them. Repeat until the target (3,3) is reached or the queue is empty.

4. **Backtrack for Path**:
   If (3,3) is reached, backtrack using the predecessors' record to reconstruct the path.

**Implementing the BFS Based on the Provided Graph**:

Extracted from the given adjacency list:
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)

**Steps in BFS from (0,0) to (3,3):**

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (1,0)
3. Move to (1,1)
4. Move to (1,2)
5. Move to (0,2)
6. Move to (0,1)
7. Move to (0,0)
8. Move to (0,3)
9. Move to (1,3)
10. Move to (2,3)
11. Move to (2,2)
12. Move to (3,2)
13. Reach (3,3)

**BFS Path with the Shortest Route (display sequentially reconstructed after BFS completion)**:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
