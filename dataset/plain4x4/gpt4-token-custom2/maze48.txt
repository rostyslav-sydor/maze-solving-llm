To solve the maze using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming to reach the target (3,3), we will first interpret the adjacency list into a usable graph format, and then perform the BFS.

- Firstly, let's parse the adjacency list to form the graph:
  ```
  (2,0) <-> (3,0)
  (0,1) <-> (0,0)
  (0,3) <-> (0,2)
  (2,2) <-> (3,2)
  (1,3) <-> (1,2)
  (3,2) <-> (3,3)
  (2,3) <-> (3,3)
  (1,1) <-> (2,1)
  (2,2) <-> (2,1)
  (3,0) <-> (3,1)
  (1,3) <-> (2,3)
  (0,1) <-> (0,2)
  (3,1) <-> (3,2)
  (1,2) <-> (0,2)
  (1,0) <-> (1,1)
  ```

- Convert this into a dictionary for easier management where each key holds its neighbors:
  ```python
  graph = {
    (0,0): [(0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
    (0,2): [(0,3), (0,1), (1,2)],
    (0,3): [(0,2)],
    (1,0): [(1,1)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (2,1)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (0,2)],
    (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(1,1), (2,2)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (3,2)],
    (2,3): [(3,3), (1,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (3,3), (2,2)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
  }
  ```

- Now implement BFS from (0,0) to (3,3):

  1. Start with a queue initialized with the origin, and a visited set to track already visited nodes.
  2. Use a dictionary `predecessor` to keep track of paths: `predecessor[child_node] = current_node`.
  3. Explore each node until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.

- Sorting out the BFS logic:

  ```python
  from collections import deque

  def bfs(graph, start, end):
      queue = deque([start])
      visited = set([start])
      predecessor = {start: None}
      
      while queue:
          current = queue.popleft()
          
          if current == end:
              break
          
          for neighbor in graph[current]:
              if neighbor not in visited:
                  visited.add(neighbor)
                  queue.append(neighbor)
                  predecessor[neighbor] = current
      
      if end in visited:
          path = []
          step = end
          while step is not None:
              path.append(step)
              step = predecessor[step]
          path.reverse()
          return path
      else:
          return []

  solution_path = bfs(graph, (0,0), (3,3))
  ```

- Return the solution path in the requested format:

  ```python
  print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(str(pos) for pos in solution_path), "<PATH_END>")
  ```

Executing this entire procedure will result in the output of the path from (0,0) to (3,3) formatted correctly between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.
