To solve this maze using a BFS approach and trace the path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3), let's parse the adjacency list first and then apply the BFS algorithm.

1. Parse the adjacency information to create the graph:
   - Convert connections like `(2,1) <--> (2,2)` into a usable graph format.

2. Apply BFS to find the shortest path:
   - Use a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and predecessors to trace back the path from the target to the origin.

### Graph Construction
The graph, based on edges specified, can be constructed as follows:
```python
graph = {
    (2, 1): [(2, 2), (1, 1)],
    (1, 1): [(1, 0), (2, 1)],
    (3, 2): [(3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2)],
    (1, 2): [(0, 2), (1, 3)],
    (3, 3): [(3, 2), (2, 3)],
    (0, 3): [(0, 2)],
    (3, 1): [(3, 0), (3, 2)],
    (2, 3): [(3, 3), (1, 3)],
    (1, 0): [(2, 0), (1, 1)],
    (1, 3): [(1, 2), (2, 3)],
    (0, 2): [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 0), (0, 2)],
    (3, 0): [(3, 1), (2, 0)],
    (2, 0): [(3, 0), (1, 0)],
    (0, 0): [(0, 1), (1, 0)],
    (2, 2): [(2, 1), (3, 2)]
}
```

### BFS Algorithm
Starting at (0,0), we perform BFS while keeping track of each node's predecessor:

```python
from collections import deque

# Starting and target points
origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)

# Setup structures for BFS
queue = deque([origin])
visited = {origin: None}
paths = []

# BFS Process
while queue:
    if target in visited:
        break  # Stop when target is found
    current = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited[neighbor] = current  # Track how we reached here
            queue.append(neighbor)

# Backtracking to determine path
if target in visited:
    step = target
    while step is not None:
        paths.append(step)
        step = visited[step]
    paths.reverse()

# Format the output as required
path_output = "<PATH_START> " + " ".join(str(p) for p in paths) + " <PATH_END>"
print(path_output)
```

This code constructs the graph, runs a BFS to both find the route and a dictionary to backtrack from the target to the origin, reconstructing the path that would be printed as expected:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
