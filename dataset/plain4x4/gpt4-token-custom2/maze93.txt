To solve the maze from this adjacency list and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm:

1. **Convert the Adjacency List to a Graph Representation**:
   We first need to parse the adjacency list and construct a dictionary where each key is a node (coordinate pair) and each value is a list of connected nodes (neighbors).

2. **Perform BFS to Find the Shortest Path**:
   Using BFS, we can explore the maze level by level, starting from the origin, until we find the target. We also need to keep track of the path using a predecessor map.

3. **Backtrack to Get the Path**:
   Once we reach the target, we use the predecessor map to backtrack from the target to the origin, thereby retrieving the shortest path.

Here are the step-by-step details:

**Step 1: Parse the adjacency list**
```plaintext
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
```
Construct the graph from this representation.

**Step 2: Execute BFS from the origin (0,0)**
- Start from (0,0), marking it as visited and enqueue it.
- Dequeue (0,0), visit its neighbours.
- Continue this process, marking nodes as visited and enqueuing their neighbours until we reach (3,3).

**Step 3: Construct the path**
- Backtrack using a predecessor map starting from (3,3) back to (0,0).

The parsed graph and BFS execution give us:
```plaintext
(0,0) -> [(0,1)]
(0,1) -> [(0,0), (0,2)]
(0,2) -> [(0,1), (1,2)]
(1,2) -> [(0,2), (1,3)]
(0,3) -> [(1,3)]
(1,3) -> [(0,3), (2,3)]
(1,0) -> [(1,1), (2,0)]
(1,1) -> [(1,0), (2,1)]
(2,0) -> [(1,0), (3,0)]
(3,0) -> [(2,0), (3,1)]
(3,1) -> [(3,0), (3,2)]
(3,2) -> [(2,2), (3,1), (3,3)]
(2,2) -> [(2,3), (3,2)]
(2,3) -> [(1,3), (2,2)]
(3,3) -> [(3,2)]
```

Path calculation:
- Start at (0,0), up to (0,1), then (0,2), then (1,2), and keep moving until reaching (3,3).

Final path:
```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This ordered list of moves provides a sequence from the start to the end of the maze.
