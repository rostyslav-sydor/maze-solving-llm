To solve the maze, let's first parse the adjacency list into a graph (using a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors), then apply Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `origin` (0,0) to the `target` (3,3). Here's the step-by-step explanation of this process:

1. Convert the adjacency list provided in the query into a graph representation.
2. Implement BFS to traverse this graph. Start at (0,0) and explore each node until reaching (3,3).
3. Record the path taken by backtracking from the destination to the source after reaching the target using BFS.

### Parsing the Adjacency List into a Graph
We have the adjacency list in the format:
```
<ADJLIST_START> (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; <ADJLIST_END>
```
We can create a `graph` dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.

### Implementing BFS
BFS uses a queue to visit nodes layer by layer. Start with the `origin` (0,0) and visit all its direct neighbors, enqueue any unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited, and continue until the `target` (3,3) is found.

### Recording the Path
Keep track of how each node was reached by storing its predecessor. Once the target is reached, backtrack from the `target` to the `origin` using these predecessors to reconstruct the path.

### BFS Algorithm Execution and Path Reconstruction
- Create a graph from the adjacency list
- Use BFS starting from `(0,0)`
- Track preceding nodes to be able to retrace the path once `(3,3)` is reached
- Return the path in the required format

### Example Path Calculation
From my analysis:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path is derived by moving straight from the origin `(0,0)` to `(0,3)` through connected nodes, and then up through the connection from `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`, then to `(2,3)`, and finally to the target `(3,3)`. Each step involves moving to a direct connection as defined in the adjacency list mentioned in the prompt.

This detailed approach should resolve the maze using the BFS algorithm for traversing and finding the shortest path efficiently.
