To solve the maze given in the second prompt, we first translate the adjacency list into a graph representation and use the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). We will track the predecessors to reconstruct the path once we reach the target.

Let's solve the maze by implementing BFS:

1. Start at the origin, (0,0).
2. From (0,0), move to (1,0).
3. From (1,0), move to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), move to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), move to (3,3).

The BFS path found is thus:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path is constructed by following each node's connections from the origin to the target while making sure not to revisit nodes, ensuring we find the shortest path possible. Each step of the movement is permitted by the adjacency relationships provided in the maze's adjacency list description.
