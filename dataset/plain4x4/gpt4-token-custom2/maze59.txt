To solve the provided maze and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Below are the steps followed in BFS, resulting in the solution.

1. Initialize the BFS with the starting node `(0,0)`.
2. Mark `(0,0)` as visited and enqueue it.
3. Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors. For each neighbor, check if it is the target or if it needs to be visited and enqueued.
4. Continue this process until the target `(3,3)` is reached or all nodes are examined.

Parsing the adjacency list provided:
```
(2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (0,2) <--> (1,2) ; (2,2) <--> (2,3) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,2) <--> (2,1) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0)
```
Construct the adjacency list and perform BFS. Start from `(0,0)`:
- From `(0,0)`, visit `(1,0)`
- From `(1,0)`, visit `(2,0)`
- From `(2,0)`, visit `(3,0)`
- From `(3,0)`, visit `(3,1)`
- From `(3,1)`, visit `(3,2)`
- From `(3,2)`, visit `(3,3)`

Combining the above steps in order, the complete path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

That is the path using BFS, which typically provides the shortest route in a maze represented by an unweighted graph as given here.
