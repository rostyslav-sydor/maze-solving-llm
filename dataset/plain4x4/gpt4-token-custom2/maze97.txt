Analyzing the maze's adjacency list and applying a BFS algorithm, the following path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) can be derived step by step:

1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1) according to the connection (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Move to (1,1) according to the connection (0,1) <--> (1,1).
4. Move to (1,2) according to the connection (1,1) <--> (1,2).
5. Move to (1,3) according to the connection (1,2) <--> (1,3).
6. Move to (0,3) according to the connection (1,3) <--> (0,3).
7. Move to (0,2) according to the connection (0,3) <--> (0,2).
8. Move to (1,2) according to the connection (1,2) <--> (0,2) (you could also stay but going by rule, moving next step given).
9. From (1,2), go to (2,2) as (1,2) <--> (2,2).
10. Move to (2,3) according to the connection (2,2) <--> (2,3).
11. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3) via connection (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Combining these moves together provides a validated path through the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
