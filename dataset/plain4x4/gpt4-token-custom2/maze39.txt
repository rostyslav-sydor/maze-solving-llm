To find the shortest path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) using the provided adjacency list, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS). This approach ensures we explore paths efficiently in terms of both distance and computation for an unweighted graph.

The adjacency list and relation from the maze can be summarized as follows:

- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2), (1,1)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0), (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3), (3,3)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)

These adjacency pairs help lay down the paths and traversal options at each node.

Using BFS, let's find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Initialize the process from the origin (0,0).
2. From (0,0), move right to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), move right to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), move down to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move down to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), move right to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), move down to (3,3).

We trace the path from the entry point to the exit using BFS as follows:
- Start from (0,0)
- Visit (0,1)
- Visit (0,2)
- Visit (1,2)
- Visit (2,2)
- Visit (2,3)
- Reach (3,3)

The quickest path found from parsing through the adjacency list and applying BFS step-by-step is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
