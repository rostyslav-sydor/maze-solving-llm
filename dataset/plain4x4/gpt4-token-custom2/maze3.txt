Starting from the origin at (0,0) and aiming to reach the target at (3,3), we can approach this problem using a BFS algorithm, which is effective in unweighted graphs such as this to find the shortest path. Here is the step-by-step BFS traversal:

1. Start from (0,0)
2. The pathway choices from (0,0) include moving to (0,1) based on the connections given.
3. From (0,1), the pathway forward includes moving to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), we have a connection to both (1,2) and (0,3) in the list.
5. Continuing from (1,2) (because it seems to head more centrally), it connects directly to (1,1) or indirectly to (0,2) which doesn't help us move towards the target, or (2,2) moving downwards.
6. From (2,2), the possible moves include (2,3) or (3,2). Move to (3,2) to approach the target.
7. From (3,2), we can move directly to (3,3), our target.

Using these paths, we determine the BFS traversal to our target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This ensures the shortest pathway given the adjacency list and the start to end points provided.
