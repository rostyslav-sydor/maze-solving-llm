To solve the maze described in the question, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method to determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Using the adjacency list provided, we parse and establish reachable coordinates and then step through each, marking nodes as visited and tracing the path to the destination.

### Maze Parsing
1. Extract and parse the adjacency list from the tokens to create a graph in the form of a dictionary where each coordinate is a key, and its reachable neighbors are values in a list.

### BFS Implementation
1. Initialize a queue with the start node (0,0) along with a set to track visited nodes and a dictionary to record the path.
2. Explore each node’s neighbors (using the adjacency list) and check if the target has been reached.
3. Track the shortest path using a dictionary till the target (3,3) is found.

### Adjacency List to Dictionary Conversion
Based on the format `(A,B) <--> (C,D)`, we convert it to a dictionary:

```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(0,1), (1,0)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)],
    (0,3): [(0,2)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0), (1,1)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (1,2), (0,1)],
    (1,2): [(1,1), (1,3), (0,2)],
    (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(2,0), (2,2), (3,1)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (2,3)],
    (2,3): [(2,2), (1,3), (3,3)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (3,3)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
}
```

### BFS Execution for Path Finding
Here’s the BFS traversal initiated from the origin to the target:

1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1), then (0,2).
3. Proceed to (1,2) switching to the first row.
4. Move to (1,3), then to (2,3).
5. From (2,3), directly connect to the target (3,3).

Following this analysis, rewrite this path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is derived from the simulated BFS on the graph constructed from the adjacency list and represents one of the viable shortest paths given the connections available in the maze.
