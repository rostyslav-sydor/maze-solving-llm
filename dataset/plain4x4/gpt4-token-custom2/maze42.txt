Using a graph traversal technique like breadth-first search (BFS), which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can determine the step-by-step path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided.

**Constructing the Graph:**
- From the adjacency list, form a dictionary where each key is a vertex (denoted as a tuple) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices connected to it.

**Performing BFS to find the shortest path:**
1. Start BFS from the origin (0,0), marking it as visited.
2. Explore all reachable vertices level by level, keeping track of each node's predecessor for path reconstruction.
3. Once the target (3,3) is found, backtrack using the predecessors to find the complete path.

**Vertices and Edges:**
- Parse the adjacency list:
  ```
  (2,3) <--> (3,3), ...
  ```

**Building and Initializing the Graph:**
We initialize the graph:
```python
graph = {
  (0,3): [(1,3), (0,2)],
  (0,2): [(0,3), (0,1)],
  (0,1): [(0,2), (0,0)],
  (0,0): [(0,1), (1,0)],
  (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3), (1,2)],
  (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
  (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)],
  (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1), (2,2)],
  (2,2): [(3,2)],
  (3,1): [(3,2), (2,1), (3,0)],
  (3,0): [(3,1)],
  (2,1): [(3,1), (1,1), (2,0)],
  (1,1): [(1,2), (2,1)],
  (1,2): [(1,3), (1,1)],
  (1,0): [(2,0), (0,0)],
  (2,0): [(1,0), (2,1)]

}
```

**Using BFS for the Shortest Path:**
Starting with a queue initialized with (0,0), appending each discovered node together with its predecessor, until reaching (3,3), we get the path:
- From (0,0) explore (0,1), then (0,2), then (0,3), then (1,3), then (2,3), then (3,3).

**Trace the Shortest Path from (3,3) to (0,0):**
Using a reverse approach for the predecessor links starting from (3,3):
- (3,3) <- (2,3) <- (1,3) <- (0,3) <- (0,2) <- (0,1) <- (0,0)

Given the details above, the path would be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
Reconstructing this path involves processing the connection details given in the adjacency list, running BFS on this constructed graph, and then reporting the sequence of moves as outlined above.
