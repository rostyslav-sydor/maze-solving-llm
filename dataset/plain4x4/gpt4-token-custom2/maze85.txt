Starting with the origin at (0,0) in this maze quest, we'll utilize a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to navigate through the adjacency list provided, taking steps toward the target at (3,3) while ensuring each node visited is tracked to avoid revisits, ensuring an optimal path.

Graph adjacency list parsing from the question input:
- (1,1) is adjacent to (0,1)
- (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0)
- (3,2) is adjacent to both (3,3) and (3,1)
- (2,3) is adjacent to both (3,3) and (1,3)
- (0,3) is adjacent to (1,3)
- (2,0) is adjacent to both (3,0) and (1,0)
- (1,3) is adjacent to (2,3)
- (1,1) is connected to (2,1)
- (3,0) is connected to (3,1)
- (1,2) is connected to (0,2)
- (2,2) is connected to both (2,3) and (1,2)
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1)
- (2,0) is connected to (1,0)

Steps using BFS to find the shortest path:
1. Starting at (0,0), the only connected node is (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), navigate to (3,0).
4. Moving to the right, the next node from (3,0) is (3,1).
5. From (3,1), it connects to both (3,2) and (2,1). Based on the available paths, move to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), the next available move is to (3,3), the target.

The constructed path following this BFS approach:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This successful completion of the BFS yields the shortest path between the starting point (0,0) and the endpoint (3,3) as outlined above, visiting each node exactly once and ensuring all routes were systematically explored from the adjacency list provided.
