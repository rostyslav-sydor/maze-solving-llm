To solve the maze problem, we first interpret the graph given by the adjacency list. We then perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) on this graph representation.

The adjacency entries suggest direct connections between the nodes or cells in the grid-form of the maze. Using BFS will help discover the shortest path from the origin to the destination by exploring all possible routes one step at a time, expanding paths from the nearest node until the target is reached.

**Graph Representation:**
- Nodes represent coordinates in the maze.
- Edges represent the allowed movements between these coordinates.

1. Parse the adjacency list to construct the graph in the form of a dictionary where each key points to a set of its neighbors:
   ```python
   graph = {
       (0,2): {(1,2), (0,1), (0,3)},   
       (1,2): {(0,2), (1,1)},
       (3,3): {(3,2), (2,3)},
       (0,0): {(0,1), (1,0)},
       (2,0): {(1,0), (3,0)},
       (3,1): {(3,2), (3,0)},
       (2,3): {(1,3), (3,3)},
       (1,3): {(0,3), (1,2)},
       (2,2): {(2,1)},
       (2,1): {(2,2), (1,1)},
       (1,1): {(1,2), (2,1)},
       (0,3): {(0,2), (1,3)},
       (0,1): {(0,0)},
       (3,2): {(3,1), (3,3)},
       (1,0): {(0,0), (2,0)}
   }
   ```
   
2. Implement BFS to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):
   ```python
   from collections import deque, defaultdict

   # Start BFS from origin
   queue = deque([(0,0)])
   visited = {(0,0)}
   parent = {(0,0): None}

   while queue:
       node = queue.popleft()
       
       # If target is reached, construct the path
       if node == (3,3):
           path = []
           while node:
               path.append(node)
               node = parent[node]
           path.reverse()
           break

       # Explore neighbors
       for neighbor in graph[node]:
           if neighbor not in visited:
               visited.add(neighbor)
               parent[neighbor] = node
               queue.append(neighbor)
   ```

3. Construct the path from the BFS traversal:
   ```python
   path  # Contains the sequence of steps from origin to destination
   ```

**Output the path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This walks directly south and then east to the goal, representing the traversal provided by BFS, and following the adjacency links through the maze as provided by the graph structure.
