To solve the second maze, we follow a similar BFS approach as explained before. Given the origin at (0,0) and the destination at (3,3) with the adjacency list of connections, we explore the connections systematically:
1. Start from (0,0)
2. Move right to (0,1)
3. Move right to (0,2)
4. Move right to (0,3)
5. Move down to (1,3)
6. Move down to (2,3)
7. Move down to (3,3)

Upon backtracking and reassembling the path from our BFS, we find the calculated path in your given maze with connected nodes:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
