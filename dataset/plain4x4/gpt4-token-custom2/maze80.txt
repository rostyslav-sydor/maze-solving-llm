To solve the maze from origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), a shortest path strategy such as Breadth First Search (BFS) can be utilized. The BFS algorithm will explore the maze layer by layer until reaching the target. Here's how the BFS would typically proceed based on the adjacency list provided:

We start at (0,0) and explore all accessible neighboring nodes, recording the paths.

1) Start at (0,0). The neighbors are (1,0) and (0,1).

2) From (0,1), move to next unvisited neighbor (0,2).
   From (1,0), move to next unvisited neighbor (2,0).

3) From (0,2), move to next unvisited neighbor (1,2).
   From (2,0), move to next unvisited neighbor (3,0).

4) From (1,2), choose between neighbors (1,1) and (1,3).
   From (3,0), move to next unvisited neighbor (3,1).

5) Continue from (1,1) if chosen, otherwise from (1,3) go to (2,3).
   From (3,1), continue to (3,2).

6) If at (1,1), go to (2,1).
   Continue from (2,3), move to (3,3) which is our destination.
   If from (3,2), also reach target (3,3).

Having followed these steps, the path traced from the origin to the target using BFS provides the shortest route. Let's confirm this checking each connection from the adjacency list and linking the above steps to ensure viability.

Given our assembled journey through the maze:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Thus, the final formatted solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
