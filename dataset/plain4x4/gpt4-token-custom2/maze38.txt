To find a solution for the maze, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph from the origin to the destination using the adjacency list provided. This method involves exploring all possible paths systematically by expanding the frontier from the origin and recording the path to the destination.

Given the adjacency list and the origin and target positions from the data, we can reconstruct the graph and solve the maze. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Using BFS, explore possible paths while marking nodes as visited.

Based on the graph's adjacency information:
- (3,3) connects to [(3,2), (2,3)]
- (1,0) connects to [(1,1), (2,0)]
- (0,3) connects to [(1,3)]
- (3,1) connects to [(3,2)]
- (1,2) connects to [(0,2), (1,1)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,0), (2,2)]
- (1,1) connects to [(0,1)]
- (2,2) connects to [(1,2), (2,1)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0)]
- (3,0) connects to [(2,0), (3,1)]
- (0,2) connects to [(1,2)]
- (2,3) connects to [(1,3), (3,3)]

Starting BFS traversal:

a. From (0,0), explore (0,1).
b. From (0,1), move on to neighbors, but backtrack due to the lack of new nodes.
c. From (0,0), explore (1,0) next owing to its connection.
d. From (1,0), access (1,1) and (2,0).
e. From (1,1), traverse to (0,1) (already visited) and (1,2).
f. From (1,2), advance to (0,2) and complete neighbors.
g. From (2,0), head to (3,0) and (2,1).
h. From (2,1), explore (2,2).
i. From (2,2), proceed to (1,2) (visited) and interact with new node towards destination:
   - Follow (2,2) to (3,2).
   - Finally, from (3,2), reach the end node at (3,3).

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) in BFS order, concatenating visited nodes leading finally to the destination:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (2,0) (3,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the given nodes and edges to solve the maze as described in the adjacency list.
