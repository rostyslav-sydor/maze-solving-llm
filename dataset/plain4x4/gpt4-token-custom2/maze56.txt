Starting from the origin at (0,0), let's trace a path to the destination (3,3) using the given adjacency relationships among nodes in the maze:

1. Initialize by identifying all the adjacent nodes for each coordinate from the adjacency list:
   - (0,0): Connected to (0,1), (1,0)
   - (0,1): Connected to (0,0), (0,2)
   - (0,2): Connected to (0,1), (0,3)
   - (0,3): Connected to (0,2), (1,3)
   - (1,0): Connected to (0,0), (2,0)
   - (1,1): Connected to (1,2), (2,1)
   - (1,2): Connected to (1,1), (1,3)
   - (1,3): Connected to (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)
   - (2,0): Connected to (1,0), (3,0)
   - (2,1): Connected to (1,1), (3,1)
   - (2,2): Connected to (3,2)
   - (2,3): Connected to (1,3), (3,3)
   - (3,0): Connected to (2,0), (3,1)
   - (3,1): Connected to (3,0), (3,2), (2,1)
   - (3,2): Connected to (3,1), (3,3), (2,2)
   - (3,3): Connected to (3,2), (2,3)

2. Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) with the origin as the starting point:
   - Start from (0,0)
   - Visit (0,1), enqueue
   - Visit (1,0), enqueue
   - From (0,1), next visit (0,2), enqueue
   - From (1,0), next visit (2,0), enqueue
   - From (0,2), next visit (0,3), enqueue
   - From (2,0), next visit (3,0), enqueue
   - From (0,3), next visit (1,3), enqueue
   - From (3,0), next visit (3,1), enqueue
   - From (1,3), next visit (2,3), enqueue
   - From (3,1), next visit (3,2), enqueue
   - From (2,3), next visit (3,3), enqueue (destination reached)

3. Once the destination (3,3) is reached, backtrack to retrieve the path:
   - Backtrack from (3,3) to (2,3)
   - From (2,3) to (1,3)
   - From (1,3) to (0,3)
   - From (0,3) to (0,2)
   - From (0,2) to (0,1)
   - From (0,1) to (0,0), thus completing the path from start to end

Path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
