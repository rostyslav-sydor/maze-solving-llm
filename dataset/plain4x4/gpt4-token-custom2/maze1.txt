To solve the maze using the provided adjacency list, I will utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS), a common algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here is the full solution:

**Start Point:** (0,0)
**End Point:** (3,3)

**Adjacency List Conversion:**
- Convert the adjacency list into a workable format for BFS:
  ```
  (1,0)        <-> (2,0)
  (1,1)        <-> (1,2)
  (2,1)        <-> (3,1)
  (3,3)        <-> (2,3), (3,2)
  (0,1)        <-> (0,0)
  (0,0)        <-> (1,0)
  (1,3)        <-> (2,3), (0,3)
  (0,2)        <-> (0,3)
  (2,1)        <-> (2,2)
  (3,1)        <-> (3,0)
  (2,0)        <-> (3,0)
  (2,2)        <-> (1,2)
  (0,2)        <-> (0,1)
  ```

**Approach:**
1. Initialize BFS with the start node (0,0) and a queue data structure.
2. Mark the start node as visited.
3. From the current node, examine its neighbors and enqueue any that haven't been visited, marking them as visited and recording their parent.
4. Continue until the queue is empty or the target node (3,3) is reached.

**BFS Execution:**
1. Begin at (0,0). Queue: [(1,0)], visited: [(0,0)]
2. Explore (1,0). Queue: [(2,0)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0)]
3. Explore (2,0). Queue: [(3,0)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
4. Explore (3,0). Queue: [(3,1)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)]
5. Explore (3,1). Queue: [(2,1), (3,2)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)]
6. Explore (2,1). Queue: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1)]
7. Explore (3,2). Queue: [(3,1), (2,2), (3,3)], visited: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (3,2)]
8. Explore (3,3). Target reached.

**Path Backtracking:**
To retrace the path, backtrack from the end node to its parent until the start node is reached: 
(3,3) --> (3,2) --> (2,2) --> (2,1) --> (3,1) --> (3,0) --> (2,0) --> (1,0) --> (0,0).

**Final Path:** 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
