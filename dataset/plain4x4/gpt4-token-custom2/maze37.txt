To solve this maze using the adjacency list provided and to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which discovers the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The adjacency list representation of the maze is converted into a dictionary for easier manipulation, and BFS proceeds by exploring each node's neighbors while keeping track of visited nodes.

Parsing the adjacency list, we get connections in the graph as:

- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)

Step by step guide to solve with BFS:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0).
3. Move to (1,1).
4. Move to (1,2), and then to (2,2).
5. Move to (3,2), and then reach the final target, (3,3).

The path in the required format would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path is the shortest based on the connections established in the adjacency list provided, with BFS ensuring an optimal solution.
