To solve the given maze with the origin at (0,0) and the target at (3,3), we start by interpreting the adjacency list and translate it into a form suitable for applying Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is utilized for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Building the Graph
From the adjacency list provided:
```
(2,0) <--> (3,0) 
(2,1) <--> (3,1) 
(1,2) <--> (1,1) 
(1,0) <--> (0,0) 
(0,2) <--> (0,3) 
(2,1) <--> (2,2) 
(0,0) <--> (0,1) 
(0,1) <--> (0,2) 
(2,0) <--> (1,0) 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) 
(2,3) <--> (3,3) 
(1,3) <--> (0,3) 
(2,3) <--> (1,3) 
(3,2) <--> (3,3) 
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
```
We construct a graph where each node has edges to its connected nodes as listed above.

### BFS to Find the Shortest Path
1. Start BFS from the origin node (0,0).
2. Explore all neighbors of each node, while marking nodes as visited.
3. Track the node from which each visited node was reached for path reconstruction.
4. Stop when the target node (3,3) is reached.

### Reconstructing the Path
- Backtrack from the target node (3,3) to the origin node (0,0) using the saved parent information.

Following the logic with our BFS and given the provided connections, the shortest path is:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Go right to (0,1).
3. Continue right to (0,2).
4. Go right again to reach (0,3).
5. Move down to (1,3).
6. Continue traveling down to (2,3).
7. Finally, go down once more to enter (3,3), the target.

Thereby, the path solution is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path represents a valid way from the start to the end, going through directly connectable points in the traversal order specified.
