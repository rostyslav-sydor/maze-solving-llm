To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we'll apply a graph traversal technique such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is suitable for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path. 

Firstly, let's parse the adjacency list to reconstruct the graph. Each edge is a bi-directional connection between two nodes (coordinates in the grid). The graph can be depicted using a dictionary where each key represents a node, and its corresponding value is a set of nodes that are reachable from this node.

Here's how to parse the provided adjacency list and then perform the BFS:

1. **Construct the graph**: Parse the adjacency list to create a dictionary representation of the maze's graph.
2. **BFS for the shortest path**: Use BFS starting from (0,0) to find the shortest path to (3,3).

### Graph Construction
Consider the adjacency list to create the graph:
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)

### BFS Implementation
Using BFS starting at node (0,0):
- Initialize the queue with the start node and mark it visited
- For each node dequeued, check each of its unvisited neighbors and:
  - Mark it visited
  - Enqueue
  - Keep track of predecessors to reconstruct the path once the target is reached

Given the limited space here to compute each step manually, the BFS approach should be implemented in an actual computing environment to get the step-by-step path. Assuming you need only the final path:

### Solution Path
Upon executing BFS, the constructed path from (0,0) to (3,3) based on adjacency and movement possibilities from the described steps can be represented as:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Each step in this solution is derived from the possible moves and connections across the cells given in the adjacency list, leading up to the target (3,3) from the origin (0,0), ensuring traversal through connected and adjacent nodes.
