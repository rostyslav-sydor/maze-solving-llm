To solve the given maze by finding a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we will:

1. Parse the adjacency list to understand the graph structure.
2. Implement BFS beginning from the origin, exploring all reachable nodes systematically, and stopping once we reach the target.
3. Record the pathway from the origin to the target by tracing the path back using the node predecessors from the BFS search.

**Graph Parsing from Given Adjacency List:**
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)

**Initial Conditions:**
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)

**BFS Implementation:**

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Adjacency list based on maze description
adj_list = {
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0), (1,1)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,2), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)],
    (0,3): [(0,2), (1,3)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (1,2), (2,3)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (2,2), (1,1)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0), (2,1)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(2,0), (3,1), (2,2)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,3): [(2,2), (3,3), (1,3)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)]
}

# BFS to find the shortest path from origin to target
def bfs(origin, target):
    queue = deque([origin])
    visited = set([origin])
    predecessor = {origin: None}

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if node == target:
            break

        for neighbor in adj_list.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
                predecessor[neighbor] = node

    return predecessor

def extract_path(predecessor, target):
    path = []
    node = target
    while node is not None:
        path.append(node)
        node = predecessor[node]
    path.reverse()
    return path

# Given source and destination in the maze
origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)

# Get the shortest path using BFS
predecessors = bfs(origin, target)
path = extract_path(predecessors, target)

# Format the resulting path
result = "<PATH_START> " + " ".join(str(p) for p in path) + " <PATH_END>"
print(result)
```

This script performs BFS in the maze, retrieves the predecessor links forming the path from origin to target, and formats the path to the required output style. If you run this script based on the maze you provided, you'll receive an answer as requested.
