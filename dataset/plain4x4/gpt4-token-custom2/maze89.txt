Given the adjacency list provided and using BFS to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), let's solve step-by-step:

1. Starting at the origin (0,0), the connected node according to the list is (1,0).
2. Proceeding from (1,0) to its connected nodes, we have (2,0).
3. Moving from (2,0) leads us to (3,0).
4. From (3,0), the adjacent node is (3,1).
5. Transitioning from (3,1) allows us to access (3,2) and (2,1).
6. At (3,2), we advance to the end target (3,3).

Thus, the path following BFS and ensuring the shortest route (break if the target is found) in terms of the provided adjacency relationships is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves sequentially down the rows, incrementing to the next column as needed, and ultimately reaching the target (3,3) by the most efficient corridor as described by the adjacency list.
