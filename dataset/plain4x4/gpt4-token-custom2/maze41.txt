To solve the maze given in the problem statement, let's first parse the adjacency list into a usable data structure and then use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Parsing the adjacency list:
- The adjacency list lists connections between nodes in a graph, where each node is a coordinate in the maze.

Constructing the Graph:
- Each pair of coordinates represents an undirected edge between the two nodes, meaning they are directly connected and can be traveled between freely in both directions.

Graph Structure:
```
(1,3) <-> (2,3)
(2,1) <-> (1,1)
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
(3,2) <-> (2,2)
(2,2) <-> (1,2)
(0,0) <-> (0,1)
(1,3) <-> (1,2)
(0,2) <-> (0,3)
(1,3) <-> (0,3)
(0,1) <-> (1,1)
(3,3) <-> (2,3)
(2,0) <-> (3,0)
(3,1) <-> (3,0)
(1,0) <-> (0,0)
(3,1) <-> (2,1)
```
Begin BFS:
- Start from the origin (0,0)
- Explore every direction you can go while marking visited nodes to avoid re-visiting
- Continue exploring until you reach the target (3,3) or find the shortest path to it.

BFS Path Find:
- From (0,0) go to (0,1)
- From (0,1) go to (1,1)
- From (1,1) go to (2,1)
- From (2,1) go to (3,1)
- From (3,1) go to (3,2)
- From (3,2) go to (3,3) reaching the target

By finding predecessors and following the path backward, we can determine the path followed:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This solution provides the shortest path based on the BFS algorithm, fulfilling the requirement of connecting the origin to the target within the constraints provided by the graph's construction and adjacency list.
