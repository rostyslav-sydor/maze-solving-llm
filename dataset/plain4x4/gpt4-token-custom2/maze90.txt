Starting from the origin at (0,0), we explore the node connections provided in the adjusted adjacency list to find a feasible route to our goal at (3,3) by employing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method. This technique ensures that we find one of the shortest paths by exploring the maze layer by layer.

Following a systematic traversal based on the adjacency list, we proceed as:
1) Move up from (0,0) to (1,0) 
2) Move left from (1,0) to (1,1)
3) Continue from (1,1) to (2,1)
4) From (2,1) go to (3,1)
5) Travel right from (3,1) to (3,2)
6) Finally, move up from (3,2) to reach destination (3,3).

The complete path traced, starting from the origin and landing at the target considering the provided connections, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
