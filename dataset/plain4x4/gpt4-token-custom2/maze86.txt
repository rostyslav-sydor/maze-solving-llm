To solve this maze, we can employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on the adjacency list provided. BFS is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as this maze grid.

BFS operates using a queue mechanism where we start from an initial node (origin), explore all its neighboring nodes, mark each as visited, and repeat the process for each explored node until the destination is reached.

First, we need to extract and parse the adjacency list from the given description.

### Adjacency List Parsed:
```
(2,1) <-> (1,1)
(1,3) <-> (2,3)
(2,3) <-> (3,3)
(2,1) <-> (2,0)
(1,2) <-> (0,2)
(2,2) <-> (2,3)
(3,2) <-> (3,3)
(1,3) <-> (0,3)
(1,0) <-> (1,1)
(1,0) <-> (0,0)
(1,2) <-> (2,2)
(0,2) <-> (0,1)
(3,0) <-> (3,1)
(0,1) <-> (0,0)
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
```

### Origin and Target:
- Origin: `(0,0)`
- Target: `(3,3)`

### BFS Steps:
1. Start at `(0,0)`, discover and enqueue all reachable nodes from `(0,0)` which are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. Process `(1,0)`, discover and enqueue `(1,1)`.
3. Process `(0,1)`, discover `(0,2)`.
4. Process `(1,1)`, discover and enqueue `(2,1)`.
5. Process `(0,2)`, discover `(1,2)` and `(0,3)`.
6. Process `(2,1)`, discover and enqueue `(2,0)`.
7. Continue BFS to eventually reach `(3,3)`.

### Full Traversal Order Using BFS For Discovery:
`[(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,2), (2,1), (0,3), (1,2), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3)]`

### Backtrack to Get the Path from (0,0) to (3,3):
Start from `(3,3)` and go back via:
- `(3,3)` to `(2,3)`
- `(2,3)` to `(2,2)`
- `(2,2)` to `(1,2)`
- `(1,2)` to `(0,2)`
- `(0,2)` to `(0,1)`
- `(0,1)` to `(0,0)`

### Constructing the Solution Path:

Thus, the solution or path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` in the format of coordinate list between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

These steps highlight the shortest path following the connections specified in the given adjacency list.
