To solve the maze provided, we will follow a similar approach as described in the earlier section. We will map the adjacency list and use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 

**Reconstructing the Maze from Adjacency List**: 
The maze is represented as an adjacency list where each pair denotes direct connections between cells.

**Maze Paths**:
1. (3,3) <--> (2,3)
2. (2,0) <--> (3,0)
3. (0,0) <--> (1,0)
4. (0,0) <--> (0,1)
5. (2,1) <--> (1,1)
6. (0,3) <--> (1,3)
7. (0,2) <--> (0,3)
8. (3,1) <--> (3,2)
9. (2,2) <--> (1,2)
10. (2,3) <--> (2,2)
11. (3,0) <--> (3,1)
12. (1,3) <--> (1,2)
13. (2,1) <--> (2,0)
14. (3,2) <--> (3,3)
15. (0,2) <--> (0,1)

**Start Point**: (0,0)
**End Point**: (3,3)

**BFS Implementation**:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Add direct neighbors (1,0) and (0,1).
3. Explore (1,0): reachable from (0,0).
4. Add neighbors of (1,0): no direct connection found in adjacency list.
5. Back to (0,1): add (0,2).
6. From (0,2): can move to (0,3).
7. From (0,3): leads to (1,3).
8. From (1,3): move to (1,2).
9. From (1,2): go to (2,2).
10. From (2,2): reach (2,3).
11. From (2,3): access (3,3) - reached the target.

Following the paths and recording the nodes traced by BFS leads us to the final path:
 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path indicates the flow from the origin to the target, covering all transitions based on existing connections between nodes in the maze as defined by the adjacency list.
