To solve the maze given by the adjacency list and find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), we will employ the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this task as it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found.

### Maze Details Extracted:
- **Adjacency List:**
  - (2,2) <--> (3,2)
  - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
  - (0,2) <--> (1,2)
  - (2,0) <--> (3,0)
  - (3,0) <--> (3,1)
  - (0,2) <--> (0,3)
  - (2,3) <--> (3,3)
  - (0,1) <--> (0,0)
  - (0,1) <--> (1,1)
  - (3,2) <--> (3,3)
  - (3,1) <--> (3,2)
  - (2,1) <--> (2,2)
  - (2,1) <--> (1,1)
  - (1,2) <--> (1,3)
  - (1,3) <--> (2,3)

- **Entry Point:** (0,0)
- **Exit Point:** (3,3)

### Implementation:
We will construct the graph as a dictionary of sets, then perform BFS starting from (0,0) to find the path to (3,3).

1. **Graph Construction:**
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Graph representation
graph = defaultdict(set)
edges = [
    ((2,2), (3,2)), ((1,0), (0,0)), ((0,2), (1,2)), ((2,0), (3,0)), ((3,0), (3,1)), 
    ((0,2), (0,3)), ((2,3), (3,3)), ((0,1), (0,0)), ((0,1), (1,1)), ((3,2), (3,3)), 
    ((3,1), (3,2)), ((2,1), (2,2)), ((2,1), (1,1)), ((1,2), (1,3)), ((1,3), (2,3))
]

for (a, b) in edges:
    graph[a].add(b)
    graph[b].add(a)
```

2. **BFS Search for Path:**
```python
def bfs_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    parent = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == end:
            break
        
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] = current
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    if current != end:
        return None  # when no path is found

    # Backtrack to find path
    path = []
    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = parent[current]

    return path[::-1]

# Finding the path
path = bfs_path(graph, (0,0), (3,3))
```

3. **Output Format:**
```python
if path:
    print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(map(str, path)), "<PATH_END>")
else:
    print("No path found.")
```

### Result:
On executing this BFS, with appropriate print or processing of results, we would obtain the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,3). Each node in the path is connected directly to the next, confirming that the steps taken adhere properly to the adjacency rules provided.
