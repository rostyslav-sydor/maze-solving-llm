To solve the given maze, I will employ a breadth-first search (BFS) method to traverse through the graph created from the adjacency list and determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The BFS approach ensures that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found.

First, let's parse the adjacency list and convert it into a suitable dictionary format representing the graph, and then apply the BFS technique to track the shortest path.

1. Parsing the adjacency list:

```plaintext
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(0,3) <--> (0,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(2,0) <--> (2,1)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
```

Each element represents a two-way connection between two nodes in the graph.

2. Convert the above adjacency list into a graph representation (dictionary format):

```python
graph = {
    (0, 0): [(0, 1), (1, 0)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 0), (1, 1)],
    (0, 2): [(0, 3)],
    (0, 3): [(0, 2), (1, 3)],
    (1, 0): [(0, 0), (2, 0)],
    (1, 1): [(0, 1), (2, 1)],
    (1, 2): [(1, 3), (2, 2)],
    (1, 3): [(1, 2), (0, 3)],
    (2, 0): [(3, 0), (2, 1)],
    (2, 1): [(2, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2)],
    (2, 2): [(2, 1), (2, 3)],
    (2, 3): [(2, 2), (3, 3)],
    (3, 0): [(3, 1), (2, 0)],
    (3, 1): [(3, 0), (3,2)],
    (3, 2): [(3, 3), (3, 1)],
    (3, 3): [(2, 3), (3, 2)]
}
```

3. BFS implementation to find shortest path:

Now, we use BFS from the origin (0,0) to find the shortest path to the target (3,3) keeping track of visited nodes and predecessors for path reconstruction.

4. Calculate BFS path tracing back from destination to the origin.

The expected output after applying the BFS algorithm and calculations for backtracking the path will lead to:

```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path is derived by traversing through the connections defined in the graph and represents the shortest path between the origin and the destination considering the connections provided in the adjacency list.
