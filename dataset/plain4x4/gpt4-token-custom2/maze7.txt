Using a BFS approach to navigate through the maze from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), let's break down the connections from the adjacency list provided:

1. Parse the adjacency list to create a graph representation:

```
(1,3) <--> (1,2)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
```

2. Start BFS from the origin (0,0) and explore available paths:

Initial Step:
- Start at (0,0)

Find neighbors of (0,0):
- (1,0) and (0,1)

Continue BFS:
- From (0,1), next neighbors are (0,0) and (0,2) 
- From (0,2), next neighbors are (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2)
- From (0,3), no further nodes
- From (1,2), neighbors (1,3), (0,2)
- From (1,3), neighbors are (1,2) and (2,3)
- From (1,0), reachable directly to (1,1)
- From (1,1), neighbors are (2,1)

Continuing this process for all BFS layers until reaching (3,3):

3. Backtrack to find the path:

From (3,3):
- Reached from (2,3) which in turn is reachable from...
- (1,3), which in turn is reached from...
- (1,2), which extends back to...
- (0,2), which came from...
- (0,1), which is reached directly from...
- (0,0), our starting point.

Constructing the precise path shows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

(Note: this may not strictly be the shortest path due to graph branching at various nodes, but is one valid solution traversing from entry to exit given the adjacency specified.)
