To solve the maze, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's the step-by-step explanation on how to process the adjacency list and find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Let's parse the adjacency list and create a graph.

**Parsed Adjacency List:**

- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)

Given that we parsed the adjacency list, our graph in an understandable format is as below:

- (0,0) connects to [(1,0), (0,1)]
- (1,0) connects to [(0,0), (2,0)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2)]
- (1,1) connects to [(0,1), (1,2)]
- (1,2) connects to [(1,1), (1,3)]
- (1,3) connects to [(1,2), (2,3)]
- (2,0) connects to [(1,0), (2,1)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,0), (3,1)]
- (3,1) connects to [(2,1), (3,0), (3,2)]
- (3,0) connects to [(3,1)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,3), (3,1)]
- (3,3) connects to [(2,3), (3,2)]
- (2,3) connects to [(1,3), (3,3)]
- (2,2) connects to [(3,2)]

**BFS Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a queue with the origin point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Process each element in the queue, exploring its neighbors. If the neighbor is not visited, mark it visited and add it to the queue.
3. Keep track of visited nodes and their predecessors to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

Let's perform BFS to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):

Starting from (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Reconstructed path from predecessors:
- Start from (3,3) and backtrack using predecessors.
- Path from (0,0) to (3,3) is as follows: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).

**Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
