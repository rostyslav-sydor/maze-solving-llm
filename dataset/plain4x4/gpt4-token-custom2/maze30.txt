In this scenario, let's explore the optimal route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided. The solution relies on using breadth-first search (BFS) which is appropriate for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze or graph. Here's how BFS can be used to determine the route:

1. Initialize the BFS with the queue and start from the origin (0,0), marking it as visited.
2. Enqueue the starting point and iteratively explore each node connected to the current node, enqueueing adjacent nodes until the target is reached.
3. Keep track of the path using a predecessor map to reconstruct the route back once the target has been hit.

From the adjacency list provided for the graph:
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(0,2) <--> (0,1) ; 
(2,3) <--> (1,3) ; 
(3,2) <--> (3,1) ; 
(2,3) <--> (2,2) ; 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) ; 
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ; 
(1,1) <--> (1,0) ; 
(1,0) <--> (2,0) ; 
(0,1) <--> (0,0) ; 
(2,2) <--> (2,1) ; 
(1,0) <--> (0,0) ; 
(3,0) <--> (3,1) ; 
(3,2) <--> (3,3) ; 
(1,3) <--> (1,2) ; 
(2,0) <--> (3,0) ; 
<ADJLIST_END>
```

**Step-by-Step Path Using BFS:**

- Begin at (0,0). Neighboring nodes: (0,1) and (1,0).
- From (0,0), move to (0,1). Then from (0,1) to (0,2).
- Next, move from (0,2) to (0,3).
- From (0,3), move to (1,3), then from (1,3) to (1,2).
- Move from (1,2) to (1,1) and then to (1,0).
- From (1,0), move to (2,0) and continue to (3,0).
- From (3,0), move to (3,1), then to (3,2).
- Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the target.

The optimal path found:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This reconstructed path from (0,0) to (3,3) traverses through the maze following the valid connections specified in the adjacency list, ensuring it covers all necessary steps from origin to target.
