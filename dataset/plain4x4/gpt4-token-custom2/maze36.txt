To solve this maze using the given adjacency list and identifying the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

### Step-by-step BFS Approach:

1. **Initialize** the BFS:
   - Start at the origin (0,0).
   - Use a queue initialized with the origin.
   - Maintain a dictionary for visited nodes and their predecessors for backtracking the path.

2. **Parse the Adjacency List**:
   - Convert the adjacency list (which defines edges in the form '(x1,y1) <--> (x2,y2)') into a usable format in Python (e.g., dictionaries for easy access).

3. **Process the Queue**:
   - Dequeue the front node.
   - Mark it as visited.
   - For each of its neighbors, do the following:
     - If a neighbor is not visited, mark it as visited, register its predecessor, and enqueue it.
     - If the target is reached during this search, stop the process.
     - Continue this until the queue is empty or the target is found.

4. **Backtrack the Path**:
   - Starting from the target node (3,3), backtrack using the predecessors' dictionary captured during BFS until the origin is reached to reconstruct the path.

### Execution:
- **Initialization**: Start at (0,0).
- **Parsing**:
  ```
  Adjacency List in graph form:
  {
    (0,0): {(0,1), (1,0)},
    (0,1): {(0,0), (0,2)},
    (0,2): {(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)},
    (0,3): {(0,2), (1,3)},
    (1,0): {(0,0), (1,1)},
    (1,1): {(1,0), (2,1)},
    (1,2): {(1,3), (0,2)},
    (1,3): {(1,2), (2,3), (0,3)},
    (2,0): {(3,0), (1,0)},
    (2,1): {(1,1), (2,2), (3,1)},
    (2,2): {(2,1), (3,2)},
    (2,3): {(1,3), (3,3)},
    (3,0): {(3,1), (2,0)},
    (3,1): {(3,0), (3,2), (2,1)},
    (3,2): {(3,1), (3,3), (2,2)},
    (3,3): {(3,2), (2,3)}
  }
  ```
- **BFS Execution**:
  - Follow through the BFS algorithm as described.
  
- **Reconstruct and Return Path**:
  - Backtrack the path from (3,3) to (0,0).

After executing the BFS and backtracking the path, the solution path traced is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This provides a valid path through the maze from the origin to the target.
