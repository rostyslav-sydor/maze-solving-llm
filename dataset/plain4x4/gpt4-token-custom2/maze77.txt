Given the adjacency list and origin-target specifications for the maze, the strategy is to use BFS to find the shortest path from the origin `(0,0)` to the destination `(3,3)`.

We can build a graph from the adjacency list and perform BFS from the origin to search for any possible routes that lead to the target. Here's the breakdown and realization of that approach:

**Graph Construction:**
From the adjacency list, create a directed graph where each coordinate tuple serves as a node and edges are the connections between them. The list gives:
```
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
```

**BFS Execution:**
Starting from `(0,0)`, check each reachable node and track the path using a queue. Each node retains information about its predecessor for path reconstruction once the target is reached.

**Reconstructing the Path:**
When the BFS reaches `(3,3)`, the path is reconstructed by tracing back through the predecessors from the destination node to the origin node.

**Final Pathfinder and visualization:**
The BFS traversal likely steps through the following sequence if unobstructed:
1. From `(0,0)` move to `(0,1)`
2. From `(0,1)` move to `(0,2)`
3. From `(0,2)` move to `(1,2)`
4. From `(1,2)` move to `(1,3)`
5. From `(1,3)` move to `(2,3)`
6. From `(2,3)` move to `(3,3)`

Hence the path found from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` would be represented as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Provided the traversal through the nodes isn't restricted by any additional maze rules (like one-way paths or closed doors not listed), this would be the shortest path given the described connections.
