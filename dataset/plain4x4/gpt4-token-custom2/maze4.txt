To find the solution of the maze outlined in the above adjacency list starting from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy for guaranteed shortest path in an unweighted graph.

The adjacency list defines the following connections between nodes:

- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)

We start by constructing the graph from this adjacency list and implementing BFS to traverse the graph:

1. Convert each relation into an adjacency list:
   ```
   graph = {
       (0,0): [(1,0), (0,1)],
       (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
       (0,2): [(0,3), (1,2)],
       (0,3): [(1,3)],
       (1,0): [(0,0), (1,1)],
       (1,1): [(1,0), (1,2)],
       (1,2): [(0,2), (1,1)],
       (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3)],
       (2,0): [(3,0), (2,1)],
       (2,1): [(2,0), (2,2), (3,1)],
       (2,2): [(3,2), (2,1)],
       (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
       (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
       (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
       (3,2): [(2,2), (3,3), (3,1)],
       (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)]
   }
   ```
2. Implement BFS from (0,0):
   - Begin from (0,0) with a queue
   - Mark nodes as visited to avoid revisits
   - Keep track of parent nodes to reconstruct path upon reaching the destination

3. Processing BFS:
   - Enqueue the starting node (0,0)
   - Proceed to explore all directly connected nodes:
       For (0,0), it connects to (1,0) and (0,1). Only follow unvisited nodes.
   - Continue this process iteratively expanding to neighboring nodes and marking nodes as visited until the target (3,3) is reached or all possible paths are explored.

4. On reaching (3,3), backtrack using the recorded predecessors to derive the below path:

   <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This ensures a complete solution to the maze based on the adjacency list provided, effectively navigating through the given paths and connections.
