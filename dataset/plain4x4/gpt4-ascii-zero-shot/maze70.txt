To solve this maze using the adjacency list provided, we will perform a breadth-first search (BFS) due to its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one. Starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming to reach the target (3,3), we will proceed as follows:

1. Parse the adjacency pairs from "<ADJLIST_START>" to "<ADJLIST_END>" to form a graph.
2. Use BFS to explore paths starting from the maze entry (1,1) until reaching the exit (3,3).
3. Trace back the path from the exit to the entrance based on BFS traversal.

The parsed adjacency list indicates direct connections between cells in the grid. Converting coordinates, (1,1) at maze entry translates to the graph vertex (0,1) by considering row and column alignment. Similarly, (7,7) as the maze exit maps to the graph vertex (3,3).

Starting BFS at vertex (0,1) and aiming for (3,3), we check each connection:

1. Starting from (0,1), we explore (0,0), (0,2).
2. From (0,2), we explore (1,2), (0,3).
3. From (1,2), we explore (2,2).
4. From (2,2), we explore (3,2).
5. From (3,2), we explore (3,3), and we have reached the maze exit.

This results in tracing back the path: (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path in the coordinate list format is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
