Based on the adjacency list provided and the origin and target points, let's use a simple pathfinding algorithm (like Depth-First Search or BFS) to derive the solution from origin (0,0) to target (3,3).

**Maze Route Breakdown:**
From the adjacency list, we see the connections between coordinates, representing possible paths without walls:

1. (0,0) to (1,0)
2. (1,0) to (2,0)
3. (2,0) to (2,1)
4. (2,1) to (1,1)
5. (1,1) to (1,2)
6. (1,2) to (1,3)
7. (1,3) to (2,3)
8. (2,3) to (2,2)
9. (2,2) to (3,2)
10. (3,2) to (3,3)

**Optimized Path Construction:**
1. Start at (0,0)
2. Head right to (1,0) and then to (2,0)
3. Move down to (2,1)
4. Head up to (1,1) then to (1,2) and then to (1,3)
5. Move right to (2,3), then go left to (2,2)
6. Go down to (3,2)
7. End at (3,3)

**Output a path using the format:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
