To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we start from the origin and aim to reach the target, computing the shortest path. Here's the solution sequence:

1. Parse the adjacency list into a format useable for pathfinding algorithms.
2. Use a pathfinding algorithm, such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), to find the shortest route from the origin to the target in the graph.
3. Trace the path found and display it in the required format.

Given:
- Origin at (0,0)
- Target at (3,3)

From correctly reading the adjacency information and applying BFS, the step sequence leading from the start point to the end point can be computed.

Here's the shortest path from the origin to the destination:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the allowed moves described by the adjacency list, avoiding walls and reaching the destination in the shortest possible sequence of steps.
