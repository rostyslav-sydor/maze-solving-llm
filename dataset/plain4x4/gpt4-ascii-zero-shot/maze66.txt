To solve the given maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to determine a path from origin to target mapping the provided coordinates.

We start at coordinate (0,0) and aim to reach (3,3). Let's translate the adjacency list into a path:

1. Starting from (0,0), we move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), we go to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), we proceed to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), we switch to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), we move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), we reach the final target at (3,3).

Thus, encoding this path gives us:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
