The maze format given is an adjacency list indicating which cells are directly connected. To solve the maze from the given entry point (1,1) to the exit point (3,3), we need to find a path traversing connected cells.

Given adjacency list:
(1,1) <--> (1,0); (2,0) <--> (3,0); (1,1) <--> (1,2); (2,1) <--> (2,2); (3,1) <--> (3,2); (3,3) <--> (2,3); (0,0) <--> (0,1); (1,3) <--> (2,3); (1,2) <--> (1,3); (3,1) <--> (3,0); (0,2) <--> (0,1); (3,2) <--> (3,3); (1,0) <--> (0,0); (1,1) <--> (2,1); (0,3) <--> (0,2);

From (1,1) we can move as follows to reach (3,3):
1. Start at (1,1)
2. Move to (1,2) as (1,1) <--> (1,2)
3. Move to (1,3) as (1,2) <--> (1,3)
4. Move to (2,3) as (1,3) <--> (2,3)
5. Move to (3,3) as (2,3) <--> (3,3)

The solution path for the maze, leading from the start (1,1) to the exit (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
