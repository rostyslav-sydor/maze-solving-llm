The task is to find a path from the origin to the target based on the adjacency list provided for a maze. The adjacency list describes which cells are directly connected (i.e., which cells can be accessed from one another without any walls in between).

### Adjacency List Analysis:
- **Extract Maze Connections:** From the provided adjacency list, we understand which cells are connected directly. We build the maze grid connectivity from this.

### Origin, Target & Dimensions:
- **Origin:** (0,0)
- **Target:** (3,3)
  
### Finding the Path:
- We utilize a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search) which is apt for unweighted grid-based pathfinding problems.
- Construct a grid/maze representation based on connections provided.
- Run BFS starting from the origin (0,0). Whenever we move from one cell to a connected cell, we record the step.
- When BFS reaches the target (3,3), the recorded steps give the entire path.

### Solution:
Using BFS:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Successively explore connected cells.
3. When reaching (3,3), terminate and record the path.

The resulting (simplified conceptual execution) path: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This path explains how movement between nodes works based on the connections listed.
