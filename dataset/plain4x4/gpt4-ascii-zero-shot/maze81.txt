Given the adjacency list from the maze description, Iâ€™ll find the shortest path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)`.

Based on the adjacency relationships, the graph of the maze adjacency list can be visualized as:
```
(0,0) <-> (0,1) <-> (0,2) <-> (0,3)
   |        |                   
   v        v                 
(1,0) <-> (1,1) <-> (1,2) <-> (1,3)                 
   |                  |        |                  
   v                  v        v                  
(2,0) <-> (2,1) <-> (2,2) <-> (2,3)   
   |                             |                  
   v                             v                  
(3,0) <-> (3,1) <-> (3,2) <-> (3,3)
```

We are starting from `(0,0)` and need to reach `(3,3)`. By following the connections in the graph, we see the path `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)` ensures every step is towards our target.

Hence the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` in the maze can be given by:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
