To solve this maze, we interpret the adjacent list presented and identify the path from (1,1) to (3,3). The adjacency list shows all possible direct connections between coordinates. I'll trace a path from the start point (1,1) to the destination (3,3) using these available paths:

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Move to (1,2) as (1,1) <--> (1,2) is a valid path.
3. Next, move to (1,3) as (1,3) <--> (1,2).
4. Move to (2,3), given (2,3) <--> (1,3).
5. Finally, arrive at (3,3) from (2,3) as indicated by (3,3) <--> (2,3).

Thus, the solution to navigate through the maze from the entry at (1,1) to the exit at (3,3) respecting the node connections can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
