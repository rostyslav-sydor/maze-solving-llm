To solve the maze provided in the ASCII representation, we need to interpret the adjacency list and identify the valid path from the origin to the target. Using the adjacency list to map out the maze structure and pathfinding (such as with BFS or DFS), we locate a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Here is the maze's adjacency list with connections:
```
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
```
However, there seems to be a discrepancy in coordinates between the stated entry point in the question (1,1) as "S" and in the list (0,0) as origin. If the correct start point is from the origin (0,0), the path is:
- Start from (0,0), go to (0,1)
- Then (0,2), to (1,2)
- Then (1,3), to (2,3)
- Then (2,2), to (3,2)
- Finally, from (3,2) go to (3,3), the exit.

The path listed with the correct coordinates is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
