To solve this maze represented by the given adjacency list, we first need to visualize it based on the connections listed:

1. Translate the adjacency list into a clearer grid representation.
2. Use the start (1,1 also as S at (0,0) in adjacency terms) and end (7,7 or (3,3) in adjacency list terms).

Here is the interpretation:
- Each pair `(y,x)` represents grid coordinates. The adjacency list shows direct connections.
- Example: `(2,2) <--> (3,2)` means cell at row 2, column 2 is directly connected to cell at row 3, column 2.

From the list, trace the path:
1. Start at (0,0) as `(1,1)` the maze starting point based on your info.
2. Then proceed to the connected nodes, choosing paths that lead towards the target (3,3).

Following the connections in the adjacency list:
- Moving from (0,0) to other reachable nodes by navigating through directly connected nodes until you reach (3,3).

Calculated path:
```
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
```

Outputting the solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
