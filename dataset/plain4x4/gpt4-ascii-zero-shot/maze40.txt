To solve the maze, we need to analyze the given adjacency list and use it to trace a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list places constraints on movement between coordinate points in the maze.

Parsing the adjacency list:
- (2,1) <-> (1,1)
- (1,3) <-> (0,3)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)
- (1,2) <-> (2,2)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)
- (2,3) <-> (2,2)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (2,0) <-> (2,1)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)

Starting from the origin (0,0) we seek a path to (3,3).
We traverse connections:
- From (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)
- From (1,1) → (0,1) or (2,1)
- From (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2)
- Finally, from (3,2) → (3,3)

Thus, starting at origin (0,0) and aiming for target (3,3), the path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequence matches the connectivity defined by the adjacency list and successfully reaches the target.
