To solve this maze, we need to interpret the adjacency list representation, plan a path from the origin to the target, then present it in the requested format. We start at (0,0) and aim for (3,3).

Adjacency list provided:
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(0,3) <--> (0,2)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(2,2) <--> (3,2)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)

Start at (1,1) and find a path to (3,3). Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or any other method:
1. Start at (1,1) and move to (1,2) following the path linked between them.
2. From (1,2) go to (1,3), connected diagonally.
3. Then move to (2,3) found attached to (1,3).
4. Finally, reach the target at (3,3) from (2,3).

Therefore, the path is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
