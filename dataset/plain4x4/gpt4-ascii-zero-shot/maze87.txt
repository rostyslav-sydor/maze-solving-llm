Given the details of the maze and connections between coordinates as shared, we need to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3).

From the adjacent list:
- (3,1) connects to (3,0); (0,1) to (0,0); (2,2) to (3,2); (3,1) to (2,1); (0,2) to (0,3); (1,2) to (1,3); (0,1) to (0,2); (2,1) to (2,2); (2,3) to (1,3); (0,2) to (1,2); (0,1) to (1,1); (2,0) to (3,0); (2,0) to (1,0); (3,3) to (2,3); and (3,2) to (3,3).

Starting at (0,0), we see it is directly connected to (0,1). From there, we can move to:
- (0,1) to (0,2), then (0,2) to (1,2), (1,2) to (1,3), (1,3) to (2,3), (2,3) to (3,3).

The path from (0,0) to (3,3) is thus:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path represents a valid solution, navigating from the start to the target of the simplified maze you provided, without encountering any blocked paths or loops.
