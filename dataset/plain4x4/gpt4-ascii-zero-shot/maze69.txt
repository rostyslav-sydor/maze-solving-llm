To solve the maze, we first need to interpret the ASCII representation. The maze data structure is given as an adjacency list of coordinates that shows pathways between cells. Starting at the origin `(0,0)` and targeting `(3,3)`, we need to find a path between these coordinates. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can construct the following simplified graph model of the paths available:
- `(0,0)` connects to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,2)`
- `(0,2)` connects to `(0,3)` and `(1,2)`
- `(0,3)` connects to `(1,3)`
- `(1,0)` connects to `(2,0)`
- `(1,1)` connects to `(1,2)` and `(2,1)`
- `(1,2)` connects to `(2,2)` 
- `(1,3)` connects to `(2,3)`
- `(2,0)` connects to `(3,0)` and `(2,1)`
- `(2,1)` connects to `(2,2)`
- `(2,2)` connects to `(2,3)`
- `(2,3)` connects to `(3,3)`
- `(3,0)` connects to `(3,1)`
- `(3,1)` connects to `(3,2)`
- `(3,2)` connects to `(3,3)`

The simplest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` that can be traced from this adjacency list is:
- Start at `(0,0)`, move to `(1,0)`
- From `(1,0)`, move to `(2,0)`
- Move from `(2,0)` to `(3,0)`
- Then go from `(3,0)` to `(3,1)`, and `(3,2)`
- Finally, reach `(3,3)` from `(3,2)`

Thus, the path is `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`.
