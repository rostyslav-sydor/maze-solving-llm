The maze can be interpreted as a grid based on adjacency information provided. However, the actual representation of the grid or maze map is not provided. We will solve it by visualizing the graph connections given directly in the adjacency list for finding a path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3).

1. We parse the adjacency list:
- Connections indicate direct paths between the provided grid coordinates (x,y).

2. Determine a path from the origin to the target:
- Starting at (0,0), follow any directly connected room (x,y) ensuring that each move gets you closer to or maintains the distance to the target.
  
Let's analyze and follow potential connections:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0), as it's adjacent 
- From (1,0), go to (1,1) which is the entrance
- Then from (1,1) to (1,2)
- From (1,2) to (1,3) or (0,2)
- If go to (0,2), then (0,1), and continue to (0,0) would be backtrackingâ€”unhelpful
- Thus, choose (1,3) from (1,2)
- Then (1,3) to (2,3)
- Move from (2,3) to (3,3), which is the exit

Thus, the successful path in this graph from (0,0) to (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
