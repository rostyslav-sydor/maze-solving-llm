To solve the maze, we'll create a path using the adjacency list and following the origin to the target coordinates.

1. **Convert Coordinates**: Transform provided 2D coordinates to the maze's 6x6 grid:
   - **(1,1)** in adjacency list corresponds to **(2,2)** in the 6x6 grid format.
   - **(3,3)** in adjacency list corresponds to **(7,7)** in the 6x6 grid format.

2. **Use Adjacency List**: We'll use the adjacency list for direction and establish a path from origin to target. Given no explicit maze grid is provided, deduce from connections:
   - Starting at **(0,0)** as per adj. list correlates to **(1,1)** in 6x6.
   - Desired end at **(3,3)** as per adj. list correlates to **(7,7)** in 6x6.
   
3. **Finding Path**: The graph shows direct connections useful for shortest path calculations:
   - Start at (0,0) or (1,1 on 6x6).
   - Follow connections through the adjacency list such as (0,0) to (1,0), moving to (3,0) and (3,3).

4. **Translate Path**: Convert the path back into the coordinate system, ensuring correct matching with the maze's 6x6 grid.

Here's the most straightforward path:
```
<PATH_START>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (2,7) (2,8) (1,8) 
<PATH_END>
```
This path goes right from the starting point till it hits the maze boundary, then progressively moves towards the target adhering to the adjacency connections and maze format. The conversion to actual coordinates may be verified with the explicit maze grid when provided, but our assumption is based on typical labyrinth navigation principles and the constraint list.
