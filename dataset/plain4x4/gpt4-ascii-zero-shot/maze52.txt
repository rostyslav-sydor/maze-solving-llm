To find a path through the maze from the start (1,1) to the end (7,7) using the given adjacency list and considering that each direction moves to adjacent coordinates:

1. Parse the adjacency list between <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens.
2. Create a representation (like a graph) that can be traversed using the adjacency pairs provided:
   - Convert each coordinate to match the maze format as per adjacency list.
3. Implement a search algorithm (e.g., depth-first search or breadth-first search) using the starting coordinate (0,0) aiming to reach the target (3,3).
4. Traverse through the maze following the paths available in the adjacency list.
5. Trace back the path from the end point to the origin once the endpoint is reached.

Given the adjacency list and the path-finding logic, hereâ€™s how we apply this to find a solution:

Starting at (0,0), using the adjacency:
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
Then proceed to:
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
Continuing to:
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
And finally:
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
The path is therefore:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence follows the available connections in the adjacency list to navigate from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
