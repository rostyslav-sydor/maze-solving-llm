Based on the supplied ASCII maze adjacency list and given origin and target coordinates, we have to find the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`. 

We can create a graph with nodes representing each coordinate in the adjacency list:
- Construct nodes: `(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)`

Edges from the adjacency relationships:
- `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
- `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`
- ...

The information given suggests the maze can be solved directly from the adjacency list by applying an algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the shortest route from the start `(0,0)` to the end `(3,3)` point. 

Using this approach, an example efficient path for the maze is determined:  
`(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)`

Finally, adhering to the requested formatting:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
