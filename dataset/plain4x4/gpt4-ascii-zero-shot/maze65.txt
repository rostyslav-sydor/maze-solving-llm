Given the adjacency list, we can derive the connections between cells (converted into a usual 4x4 grid for better understanding):

Grid Layout:
```
 (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
 (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
 (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
 (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
```

The adjacency listed indicates direct paths between:
```
(0,2) <-> (0,1)
(1,0) <-> (0,0)
(1,2) <-> (1,1)
(3,0) <-> (3,1)
(2,1) <-> (1,1)
(3,2) <-> (2,2)
(1,0) <-> (2,0)
(0,3) <-> (1,3)
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
(1,3) <-> (2,3)
(3,2) <-> (3,3)
(1,2) <-> (1,3)
(2,0) <-> (2,1)
(3,3) <-> (2,3)
(0,3) <-> (0,2)
```

Since we start at (0,0) (designated as the origin) and our target is (3,3) (designated as the target), we need to derive a pathway from (0,0) to (3,3) based on these connections.

A possible path based on the connections is:
- Starting from (0,0), move to (1,0)
- From (1,0), move to (2,0)
- From (2,0), move to (2,1)
- From (2,1), head to (1,1)
- From (1,1), move to (1,2)
- From (1,2) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (2,3)
- From (2,3) to (3,3)

Thus, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
