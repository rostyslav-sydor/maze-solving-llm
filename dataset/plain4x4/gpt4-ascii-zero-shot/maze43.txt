Analyzing the ASCII maze representation provided, I can determine a path from the given entry point (1,1) or (0,0) in grid notation (counting from zero) to the exit point (7,7) or (3,3) in grid notation by utilizing the adjacency list.

The adjacency list describes the direct connections between nodes in the maze, where each node represents a cell and edges between nodes represent passages without walls. Let's solve the maze by finding a path from the origin to the target.

The adjacency list in simplified terms:
- (0,0) connected to (0,1), (1,0)
- (0,1) connected to (0,2), (1,1)
- (0,2) connected to (1,2)
- (0,3) connected to (1,3)
- (1,0) only to (0,0)
- (1,1) connected to (2,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) connected to (2,2)
- (1,3) connected to (2,3)
- (2,0) connected to (2,1)
- (2,1) connected to (1,1)
- (2,2) connected to (3,2)
- (2,3) connected to (3,3)
- (3,0) connected to (3,1)
- (3,1) connected to (3,2)
- (3,2) connected to (3,3)
- (3,3) only to (2,3)

Given the adjacency list, using simple depth-first search or breadth-first search, the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:
- Start from (0,0)
- Go to (0,1)
- Go to (0,2)
- Go to (1,2)
- Go to (2,2)
- Go to (3,2)
- Reach (3,3)

Therefore, the path coordinates are:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
