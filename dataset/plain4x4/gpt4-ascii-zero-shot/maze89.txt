The problem provided an adjacency list of reachable coordinates but incorrectly directed the entry and exit points based on a non-existent visual maze grid. Assuming the adjacency list is accurate and represents actual allowed pathways in the maze, we proceed to derive a path from the start coordinate (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on connectivity. To do this, we use typical graph navigation techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Based on given adjacencies:

- Start at (0,0), can move to (1,0).
- From (1,0), can move to (2,0).
- From (2,0), can move to (3,0).
- From (3,0), can move to (3,1).
- From (3,1), can move to (3,2).
- From (3,2), can move to (3,3).

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) following the above route is clear and direct:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path assumes optimal traversal from the start to the end point as described in the adjacency list without visual confirmation of walls or other barriers.
