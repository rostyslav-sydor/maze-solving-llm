To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we can utilize a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. The adjacency list has already provided all the direct connections between accessible points in the maze, thus simplifying our task.

Given:
- Origin at (0,0)
- Target at (3,3)

Follow the connections from the adjacency list:

1. Start at (0,0), move right since (0,0) <-> (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move right (there is no connection upwards), so (1,0) <-> (2,0).
3. Move from (2,0) upwards as (2,0) <-> (2,1).
4. From (2,1), proceed to (2,2) via (2,1) <-> (2,2).
5. Finally from (2,2) move to (3,2) through (2,2) <-> (3,2) and then to (3,3) by (3,2) <-> (3,3).

Hereâ€™s the successful path as required:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

These steps provide a clear path through the maze from the starting point to the exit using accessible connections provided.
