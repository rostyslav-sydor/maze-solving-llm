Given the maze's adjacency list, let's find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the exit (3,3).

We can convert the adjacency list to a graph representation where each node is connected to its adjacent nodes as specified by the list:

- (2,1) <-> (1,1)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (2,2) <-> (1,2)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (2,2) <-> (2,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3)

To solve this maze, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is effective as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Starting from (0,0), the BFS explores (0,1), then (0,2), (0,3), and proceeds until reaching (3,3). Following the paths connectivity and using BFS technique:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence shows the shortest path across the maze from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (3,3).
