The adjacency list provided describes a graph representing connections between cells in a maze that is implied to be a 4x4 grid. Each node in this graph is a cell in the maze that can be represented by its coordinates (row, column), and the edges represent possible movements between these cells.

The origin (entry point) of the maze is at (1,1) and the target (exit point) is at (3,3). We need to find a path from the origin to the target.

The adjacency list explicitly gives the following connections:
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)
- (1,1) <-> (2,1)
- (1,2) <-> (1,1)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,3) <-> (0,3)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (0,0) <-> (0,1)
- (2,2) <-> (2,3)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)

From (1,1), by following the connections, we can try to map a path to (3,3):

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Use connection (1,1) <-> (1,2).
3. From (1,2) use (1,2) <-> (1,3).
4. From (1,3) use (1,3) <-> (2,3).
5. From (2,3) use (2,3) <-> (3,3) to reach the target.

Thus, the path from the start to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
