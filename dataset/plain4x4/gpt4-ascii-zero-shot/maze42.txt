To solve the ASCII maze given above, we must convert the adjacency list, the starting point, and the target, to a readable map to trace a path.

Here's the interpreted adjacency list:
- Connections imply that you can move between the two points without encountering a wall.
- Each pair of coordinates, separated by '<-->', denotes passable pathways.

Given this data:
- The starting position (Entry) is (0,0).
- The exit (Target) is (3,3).

Based on the given adjacency list data:
- Each coordinate pair provides a direct path between the two points.
- Our goal is to find a path from the entry to the exit using this graph of passable pathways.

Possible pathway based on the adjacency list:

**(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)**

Converting these to the required output notation:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence passes through the consecutively connected nodes leading from the origin to the target.
