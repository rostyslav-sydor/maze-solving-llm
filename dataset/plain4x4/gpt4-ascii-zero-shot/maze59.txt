To solve the maze, I need to determine the path from the entry point, (0,0), to the exit point, (3,3), using the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list indicates which cells are directly connected without walls between them.

Here's how the adjacency list expands:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0), (0,1)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0), (0,0)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0), (3,0)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0), (3,1)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0), (0,2), (1,1)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1), (1,2)
- (0,2) connects to (0,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) connects to (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3), (1,2), (2,3)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2), (1,3)
- (2,1) connects to (2,2)
- (2,2) connects to (1,2), (2,1), (2,3)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3), (2,2), (3,3)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1), (3,3)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3), (3,2)

Using these connections, I will find the shortest path:
1. Start at (0,0), reach (1,0).
2. Move to (2,0), then (3,0).
3. From (3,0), go to (3,1), then (3,2).
4. Lastly, reach (3,3) from (3,2).

Formatted solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
