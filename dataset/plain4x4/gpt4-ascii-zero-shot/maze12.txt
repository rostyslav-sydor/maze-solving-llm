To solve the maze, we can utilize the adjacency list given to determine the possible paths from the origin to the target. Each pair of adjacent coordinates signifies that one can move directly between them.

The origin of the maze is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). We use a common graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is suitable for navigating mazes represented by adjacency lists.

Here's the detailed step-by-step BFS application:

1. Initialize a queue with the origin point and a way to track visited points.
2. Add the origin (0,0) to the queue.
3. Execute the BFS loop:
   - Dequeue the front of the queue.
   - For the dequeued point, explore all neighboring points using the adjacency relations provided.
   - If a neighboring point is the target (3,3), stop the loop and trace back the path.
   - Else, mark the point as visited, and enqueue it.

From the adjacency list, the BFS traversal would find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3).

Final path from (0,0) to (3,3) via simplest interpretation:
- Move right to (1,0) then up to (2,0), then right again to (2,1), following the path through to (3,3).

Hereâ€™s the final solved path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
