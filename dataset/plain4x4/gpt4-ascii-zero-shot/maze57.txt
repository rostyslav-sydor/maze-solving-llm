As provided, the adjacency list indicates the valid moves between the defined coordinate points in the maze. Although no actual maze representation is provided in ASCII format, I'll work with the connections as drawn from the presented adjacency list.

The origin and target are explicitly given as (0,0) and (3,3) respectively. Let's find the shortest path from the start (0,0) to the end (3,3) by exploring the adjacency list.

1. Start at (0,0).
2. From (0,0) move to (1,0) because it's directly connected.
3. Next from (1,0) move to (2,0).
4. From (2,0), proceed to (2,1).
5. Then from (2,1), move to (3,1).
6. Go from (3,1) to (3,2).
7. Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3), which is our target.

Putting this in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route follows a valid linked path from the adjacency list representing connections of walkable paths between grid points in the maze.
