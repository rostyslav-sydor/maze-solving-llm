To solve the maze, we will interpret the edges in the adjacency list to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. We can use a simple graph traversal algorithm like BFS.

1. Represent the maze as a graph where each node is a coordinate in the maze (e.g., (1,1)).
2. The adjacency list provides the edges:
   ```
   (1,3) <--> (2,3);
   (0,0) <--> (1,0);
   ...
   (3,3) <--> (3,2);
   ```
3. Start BFS from the origin (0,0) up to the target (3,3).

Following the adjacency list, the actual path from the start to the exit (manually traced or simulated using BFS considering the edges):

Path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Thus, the final solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
