First, it's essential to understand the adjacency list, which tells us how the different points (cells) in the maze are connected:

- From the list: `(3,0) <--> (3,1); (0,1) <--> (0,0); ...`, we note each pair is connected directly.
- The origin `(0,0)` and target `(3,3)` coordinates from the list align with the ASCII grid, needing conversion to maze entry `(1,1)` and exit `(7,7)`.

Using the provided adjacency list, which abstracts a graph structure of the maze, and knowing the maze starts at `(1,1)` and exits at `(7,7)`, we need to map these details into the graph's coordinate system. This involves converting simpler `(x, y)` coords into the ASCII maze's apparent grid format, accounting for walls and pathways.

Assuming the list gives us accurate navigation details and connectivity, we'll base our pathfinding process on it. Here's the path assuming simple path following according to listed nodes that can be traversable from start `(0,0)` to end `(3,3)`:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents a translated path using the initial entry and exit points where the described adjacency ensures a connection between the waypoints. Each is a legal move through some accessible passage or door as per the maze's graph.
