To solve the maze depicted by the adjacency list, it's essential to understand that each coordinate is connected to others, allowing travel without encountering walls. This adjacency list format lists pairs of coordinates that are directly accessible to each other.

1. **Setup the Maze**: Construct a representation of the maze using the adjacency list. For instance, you can use a graph where nodes are coordinates and edges show connections between nodes.

2. **Determine Start and End Points**: According to the prompt, the start ('S') is at (1,1) and the end ('E') is at (3,3).

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Apply a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the given graph to find the shortest path from start to end. BFS is suitable because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

4. **Construct the Path**: Follow the connections from the BFS to backtrace from the end point to the start point to list the path in correct sequence.

Based on the adjacency connections, execute BFS from (1,1). Given the binary nature of adjacency, if BFS is applied correctly, the shortest path from (1,1) to (3,3) using BFS on given adjacency can be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Itâ€™s crucial to verify this by visualizing the connections or with an algorithm implementation confirming this is indeed the path through the described maze.
