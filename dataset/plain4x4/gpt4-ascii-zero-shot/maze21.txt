Since you've provided an adjacency list of passable paths between nodes in the maze and defined the entry and exit points, we can solve this maze by identifying a path from the starting point (1,1) to the target point (3,3). Using the adjacency list, we can visualize or compute the path using search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

For simplicity, letâ€™s perform a search directly from the adjacency list:

1. Starting at (1,1), check adjacent cells:
   - (1,1) has edge (1,1) <--> (2,1), move to (2,1)
2. From (2,1), check adjacent cells:
   - (2,1) has edge (2,1) <--> (2,2), move to (2,2)
3. From (2,2), check adjacent cells:
   - (2,2) has edge (2,2) <--> (3,2), move to (3,2)
4. From (3,2), check adjacent cells:
   - (3,2) has edge (3,2) <--> (3,3), move to (3,3) which is the target.
   
Thus, the path from the start point (1,1) to the end point (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each move corresponds to a direct connection in the adjacency list that you've provided.
This is a simple path, assuming no obstacles other than the ones detailed in the adjacency list. Different paths may exist depending on the specific structures you haven't explicitly detailed in the adjacency list.
