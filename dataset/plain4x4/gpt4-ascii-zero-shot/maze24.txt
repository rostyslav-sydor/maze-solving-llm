To solve the maze given through your ASCII adjacency list, we will convert the adjacency relationships into a more visual or systematic approach, such as a graph, and then use a path-finding algorithm to trace a route from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The given adjacency list describes possible moves between coordinates, which can be interpreted as edges in a graph where nodes are the positions in the maze.

From the adjacency list, it's clear that nodes (coordinates) are connected as specified and we can use a simple path-finding approach, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Given adjacency list converted:
- (0,0) <-> (0,1) and (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,1) <-> (1,2)
- (1,2) <-> (2,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (2,2) <-> (1,2)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)

Using BFS starting from (0,0), we would determine the shortest path:
(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).

Here is the final solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
