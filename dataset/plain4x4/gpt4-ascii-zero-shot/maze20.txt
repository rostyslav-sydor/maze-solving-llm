To solve the maze, we can convert the adjacency list of connections between coordinates to a path from the entry point (1,1) to the exit point (3,3). Here is how it looks, keeping the succinctness in mind:

1. Start at (1,1)
2. Look in the adjacency list where (1,1) can go directly. Go to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), proceed to (1,3).
4. Proceed from (1,3), which connects to (2,3).
5. From (2,3) head to (3,3), which is the exit.

Now summarizing this path in the required format:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path reflects each step, moving from the entry point to the exit point using valid connections from the supplied adjacency list.
