To solve the maze given by the adjacency list and to find a path from the entry point (1,1) to the exit point (3,3), one would follow the connections outlined in the adjacency list.

Based on the adjacency list, the process can be approached by setting up a simple connectivity graph and performing a search, typically Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to identify a viable path.

Here's how BFS could be used to find the path from (1,1) to (3,3):
1. Start from node (1,1).
2. Check and traverse adjacent nodes that are directly connected and continue this until the target node (3,3) is reached or all possibilities are exhausted.

From the adjacency relationships mentioned:
- From (1,1), you can move to (1,2) and (2,1).
- From (1,2), you can move to (1,3).
- From (2,1), you can move to (2,2).
- ...(similar expansions using adjacency list).

The possible path thereby would become:
(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path uses direct connections available in the adjacency list and finally leads to the exit point.

Hence, the result in the required format:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
