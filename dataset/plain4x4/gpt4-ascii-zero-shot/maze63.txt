Based on the adjacency list provided, we can reconstruct the maze as nodes connected to each other. Here's the breakdown: 

```
(2,0) connects to (1,0) and (3,0)
(1,0) connects to (2,0)
(1,2) connects to (1,1) and (1,3)
(1,1) connects to (1,2), (2,1)
(0,1) connects to (0,2)
(0,2) connects to (0,3), (0,1)
(0,3) connects to (0,2), (1,3)
(3,0) connects to (2,0), (3,1)
(3,1) connects to (3,0), (2,1)
(3,2) connects to (3,3), (2,2)
(3,3) connects to (3,2)
(2,1) connects to (1,1), (3,1)
(2,2) connects to (2,3), (3,2)
(2,3) connects to (2,2), (1,3)
```

To find a path from the entry (1,1) to the exit (7,7), we map it to correct grid coordinates considering origin starts at (0,0). The exit in adjacency representation is (3,3). Using DFS or BFS, we can find:

1. Start at (1,1)
2. Move to (1,2) then (1,3)
3. Move from (1,3) to (2,3)
4. Continue from (2,3) to (2,2)
5. Go from (2,2) to (3,2) then (3,3), reaching the exit.

Formatted path :
`<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`
