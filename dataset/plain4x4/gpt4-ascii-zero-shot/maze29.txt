To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list representing connections between coordinates. Each node (x, y) point represents a cell in the maze where movements are possible. From the connections given, we can create a graph:

- Nodes: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
- Edges directly connect these nodes as mentioned in the list.

We start from the entry point (0,0) and aim to reach the target point (3,3). By mapping the adjacency relationships and using a simple search algorithm (either BFS or DFS), we can explore possible paths. The origin point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3), seeking the shortest or a valid path.

Analyzing the list, a valid path from (0,0) to (3,3) through the connections mentioned can be traced:

- Start at (0,0), move right to (0,1), then (0,2) and (0,3)
- Go down to (1,3)
- Continue down to (2,3)
- Finally, go down to (3,3)

Thus, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This sequence allows for navigating the maze from the origin to the target successfully based on the adjacency connections provided.
