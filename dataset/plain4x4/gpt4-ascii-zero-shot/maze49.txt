To solve the maze, the adjacency list is converted into a more understandable format which helps in finding the path from the start to the target:

- Vertex (x, y) will have an edge to vertex (u, v) if "(x,y) <--> (u,v)" exists in the list.

The origin and target are given as (1,1) and (3,3), respectively.

Now, we will utilize BFS (Breadth First Search) for finding the shortest path:

1. Parse the adjacency list to create a graph structure (a dictionary of connections for each node).
2. Implement BFS to explore from (1,1). Store visited nodes and the path for each visited vertex.
3. When the destination (3,3) is reached, retrace the path using the recorded parent pointers.

Here’s the path based on the adjacency list:

- Starting at (1,1):
- Visit the neighbors and proceed according to the given edges.
- Sequence to find (3,3) is (1,1) → (1,2) → move horizontally → (3,2) (using vertical edges), then to → (3,3).

Hence, the output is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
