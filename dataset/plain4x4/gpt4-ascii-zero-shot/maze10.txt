To find the path through the maze based on the adjacency list provided, we'll interpret and navigate the list, identifying a connection between cells as a possible direction to move:

Converting from adjacency descriptions:
- We see each pair showing direct connectivity between two points on a 4x4 grid.
- Starting coordinate is (0,0) while the target coordinate is (3,3).

Using standard graph traversal techniques (e.g., BFS - Breadth First Search), we identify the shortest path from (0,0) S to (3,3) E:

1. Initializing: Start at (0,0), with neighboring accessible points being (1,0) and (0,1).
2. Expand:
   - From (0,0) => (1,0) => next accessible = (2,0).
   - From (0,0) => (0,1) => no continued path due to provided graph data.
3. Continue:
   - From (2,0) => neighbors are (3,0) and (2,1). Choosing (3,0) (consider it closest route direction to (3,3)).
4. Proceed:
   - From (3,0) => neighbors are (3,1).
   - From (3,1) => neighbors are (3,2).
   - From (3,2) => neighbors are (3,3).
5. Upon reaching (3,3), the target is accessed, completing the path.

Thus, the solution, making a "zigzag" primarily through the third and fourth columns from the top, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
