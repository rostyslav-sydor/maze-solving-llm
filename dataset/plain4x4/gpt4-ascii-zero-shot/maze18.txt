To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we will first analyze and then find the path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3).

From the adjacency representation provided:
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0)
- (1,0) is connected to (2,0)
- From (2,0), we can go to (2,1)
- Follow (2,1) to (2,2)
- Follow (2,2) to (3,2)
- And from (3,2) to (3,3)

Now, we can convert this to the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path takes us from the origin to the target using the adjacency list as our guide.
