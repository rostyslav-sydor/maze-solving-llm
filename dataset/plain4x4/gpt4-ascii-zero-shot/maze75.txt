Based on the adjacency list provided in the ASCII representation and considering the stated entry and exit points, we can deduce the shortest path through the maze. Here's the adjacency analysis and resulting path:

### Maze Analysis:
1. **Vertices**: Each coordinate pair mentioned signifies a node in the maze.
2. **Edges**: The connection `<-->` denotes a navigable path between the two nodes.

Given the maze's starting point is `(1,1)` and the exit point is `(7,7)`, in adjacency list format with zero-indexed coordinates, that corresponds to a start at `(0,0)` and end at `(3,3)`. 

### Path Calculation:
From the adjacency list, we can trace the path:
- Starting from `(0,0)`, we can go to `(1,0)`
- Then move to `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`
- Proceed to `(2,3)`, and finally `(3,3)`

Thus, the shortest path from start `(1,1)` to end `(7,7)` in the matrix formation depicted is converted as:

<Path representation from `(1, 1)` to `(7, 7)` considering entered indices start from zero but requests are given in 1-indexed format>

**Final Path**:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
