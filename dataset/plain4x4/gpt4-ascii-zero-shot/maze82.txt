First, we interpret the provided ASCII adjacency list and transform it into a navigable format:
- Parse each connection: (X1, Y1) <--> (X2, Y2) indicates that cell (X1, Y1) can directly move to (X2, Y2) and vice versa, meaning these two cells are adjacent and there's no wall between them.

The adjacency list provides us:
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)

The origin is (0,0) and target is (3,3). We'll find a path from the origin to the target using the common graph traversal method, e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS), considering the entries in the adjacency list as edges:

1. Start BFS from (0,0).
2. Explore all reachable cells from the origin following the connections indicated.
3. Continue exploring level by level until (3,3) is reached.

Here's a possible path:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0) following (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- Move to (2,0) following (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- Move to (3,0) following (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- Move to (3,1) following (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- Move to (3,2) following (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- Finally, reach (3,3) following (3,2) <--> (3,3)

Therefore, the pathway in terms of maze coordinates from start to goal is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
