First, to solve the maze, we need to define the structure from the provided adjacency list and determine a path from the start point (0,0, which is confusingly written as entry point coordinate (1,1) in the context you gave) to the target point (3,3). 

The adjacency list provides direct connections between accessible points in the maze. Constructing the graph from this list and using a pathfinding algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) will enable us to find the solution.

Based on the provided list, the connections (edges) between points (nodes) are as follows: 
- Each pair (a, b) <--> (c, d) indicates a bidirectional path between point a,b and point c,d.

Given the origin (0,0) and target (3,3), let's construct a theoretical path:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) [connected directly].
3. Move to (1,1) [connected directly].
4. Move to (2,1) [connected to (1,1)].
5. Move to (3,1) [connected to (2,1)].
6. Move to (3,2) [connected to (3,1)].
7. Move to (3,3) [connected to (3,2)], which is the target.

Therefore, the path from the starting point to the exit coordinates is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution assumes the maze setup correlates perfectly with the adjacency connections provided.
