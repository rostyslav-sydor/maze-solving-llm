To solve the maze provided in your ASCII and adjacency list, we take note of the adjacency list segments and convert them into an accessible graph. The origin (entry point) is positioned at (0,0) and the target (exit point) is at (3,3). Thus, we'll utilize depth-first search (DFS) to find an optimal solution through the maze's coordinates:

1. Parse the adjacency list to construct the graph.
2. Convert the graph from adjacency list into a usable format (typically a dictionary) for navigation.
3. Implement a path-finding algorithm (DFS here) to determine route from origin to destination.
4. Start DFS from (0,0):

- From (0,0) --> (0,1)
- From (0,1) --> (0,2)
- From (0,2) --> (0,3)
- From (0,3) --> (1,3)
- From (1,3) --> (2,3)
- From (2,3) --> (3,3)

5. This path leads straight from the origin to the destination utilizing all valid connections given in the adjacency list.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This reflects an optimal path based on the adjacency list provided and adheres to the limitation of 200 words in the response.
