In this problem setup, each coordinate on a grid is represented by a tuple (row, column) where movements between adjacent nodes (cells) are specified within the adjacency list. The entry point of the maze is (0,0), and the exit point is (3,3) as derived from context.

To solve the maze, we need to find a valid path from (0,0) to (3,3) based on the connectivity described in the adjacency list. By translating the adjacencies into a graph data structure and tracing a path using a common algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), a route can be established if it exists:

1. Construct the graph using nodes (0,0) through (3,3) based on provided edges.
2. Perform BFS from (0,0):
   - Add (0,0) to the BFS queue.
   - Explore all connected nodes: (1,0), (0,1).
   - Continue the process for each node, checking if the target (3,3) is reached.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list and applying BFS or DFS:

``` 
From (0,0): 
- Move to (0,1) 
- Move to (0,2) 
- Move to (1,2) 
- Move to (1,3)
- Move to (2,3) 
- Move to (2,1)
- Move to (2,2)
- Move to (3,2)
- Move to (3,3)
```
Hence, the path from the entrance to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This forms a plausible route through the maze given the adjacency connections.
