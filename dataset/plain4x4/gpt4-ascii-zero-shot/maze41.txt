From the adjacency list provided, we can construct the maze in terms of connectivity between the nodes and deduce a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on valid adjacencies.

Nodes and their connections derived from the adjacency list:

- (0,0) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (1,1) <-> (1,2)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (1,3) <-> (0,3)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (3,1) <-> (2,1)
- (2,1) <-> (1,1)
- (2,2) <-> (1,2)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)

Based on the connected paths, a possible solution to traverse from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (1,1)
- Move to (1,2)
- Move to (1,3)
- Move to (2,3)
- Move to (3,3)

Combining this path into the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
