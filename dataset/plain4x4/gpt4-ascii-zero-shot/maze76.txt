Since the problem statement contains an adjacency list representation of a maze rather than a traditional grid representation, we'll approach solving the maze by navigating through the adjacency list.

From the list, we can derive the connected nodes (i.e., coordinates of the maze). The task is to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the final point (3,3).

From the adjacency list:
(0,0) -> (1,0)
(1,0) -> (2,0)
(2,0) -> (3,0)
(3,0) -> (3,1)
(3,1) -> (3,2)
(3,2) -> (3,3) 

Therefore, the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path strictly follows the connections from the provided adjacency list and leads directly from the starting point to the target, moving first vertically down and then horizontally to the right.
