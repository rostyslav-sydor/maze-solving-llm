Given the maze adjacency data, we can trace a path from the start point (0,0) to the target (3,3). Using depth-first or breadth-first search, we can explore connections between these points.

Here is the solution based on the adjacency list provided:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) via (0,0) <--> (1,0).
3. Then, move to (2,0) via (1,0) <--> (2,0).
4. From (2,0), move to (2,1) via (2,1) <--> (2,0).
5. Then move to (3,1) via (3,1) <--> (2,1).
6. From (3,1), move further up to (3,2) via (3,2) <--> (3,1).
7. Finally, move from (3,2) to reach the target at (3,3) via (3,2) <--> (3,3).

Given these movements, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution confirms that hypothetically the character in the maze takes the right turns and straightforward path indicated by the adjacency list from the start to the target.
