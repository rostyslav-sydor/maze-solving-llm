From the provided adjacency list, we can deduce a simplified representation of the connections between the cells in the maze. The start position is (0,0) and the target is (3,3) in the structured list. The path must traverse from this start to end position.

From the list connections:

1. (0,0) <--> (0,1)
2. (0,1) <--> (0,2)
3. (0,2) <--> (1,2)
4. (1,2) <--> (2,2)
5. (2,2) <--> (2,3)
6. (1,3) <--> (2,3)
7. (2,3) <--> (3,3)

Using these direct connections, we form a path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully utilizes the provided adjacency relationships to traverse from the starting point to the end target in the maze.
