To solve the maze described by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. The adjacency list provided shows which cells in the maze are directly connected (i.e., where passage is allowed without encountering a wall). Below, I'll deduce a valid path using these connections:

- Starting from the origin `(0,0)`, we can move to `(1,0)` as per `<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <--> (1,0);`.
- From `(1,0)`, we proceed to `(2,0)` based on `(2,0) <--> (1,0);`.
- From `(2,0)`, we continue to `(3,0)` using `(2,0) <--> (3,0);`.
- We then move to `(3,1)` according to `(3,1) <--> (3,0);`.
- Moving forward to `(3,2)` utilizing `(3,1) <--> (3,2);`.
- Proceed to `(3,3)`, which is the target, with the connection `(2,3) <--> (3,3);`.

Putting all these steps together, the path sequenced by the coordinates is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Thus, this sequence represents a valid solution to navigate from the starting point `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` in the maze.
