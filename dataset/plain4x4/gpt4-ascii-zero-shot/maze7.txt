Given the adjacency list, I will derive a suitable path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using a breadth-first search (BFS) method.

Here's how we can map out the maze based on the adjacency pairs:

- Construct a graph where each coordinate is a node and each semicolon-separated pair represents an edge.
- Starting from (0,0), explore connected nodes with BFS until the target (3,3) is reached.
  
The BFS algorithm for this maze can be summarized as follows:
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all directly connected nodes.
3. From each node, explore further connected nodes if they are not visited.
4. Continue until the target node is found.

Now, based on the given adjacency list and the BFS approach, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) can be:
(0,0) to (1,0), to (1,1), to (1,2), to (1,3), to (2,3), and then directly to (3,3).

Therefore, the answer will be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
