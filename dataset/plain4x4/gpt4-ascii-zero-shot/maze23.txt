To solve this maze, I will use the adjacency list given and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. I'll explore each node starting from (0,0) and follow through connections until (3,3) is reached, tracking the path along the way.

Starting BFS from the origin:

1. Begin from the origin `(0,0)`, the only direct connection is to `(1,0)`.
2. From `(1,0)`, move to `(1,1)`.
3. Move from `(1,1)` to `(2,1)`.
4. From `(2,1)`, move to `(3,1)`.
5. From `(3,1)`, go to `(3,2)`.
6. Move from `(3,2)` to `(3,3)`, which is the target.

Now writing down the correct path, which retraces our steps from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This is the solution according to the adjacency list, finding a path through available connections.
