The maze is represented in an adjacency list format indicating the paths between adjacent cells, while the coordinates map to a grid where each cell has connections described in the list.

From the given adjacency list:
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)

We start at (1,1) and end at (3,3). Transforming entries of the adjacency list into possible paths and navigating while avoiding cycles, determines possible progression through the maze.

Following the correct path:
- Start at (1,1)
- Move to (1,2) connected from (1,1)
- Move to (1,3) through (2,3) since it connects to (1,3)
- Since (1,3) connects directly to (2,3) due to the adjacency, move to (2,3)
- Finally, move to (3,3) from (2,3)

Thus, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
