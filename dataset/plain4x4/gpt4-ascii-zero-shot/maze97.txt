To solve the maze, we must translate the given adjacency list into understandable paths and find the shortest or one of the possible paths from the origin to the target. The origin is given as (0,0) and the target as (3,3). But the entry point is at (1,1) and the exit at (3,3), as stated. Using a breadth-first search or depth-first search algorithm can help in navigating this.

Given the adjacency list:

- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)

Mapping these paths will create the following potential route from point (1,1) to (3,3):

- Starting at (1,1)
- Move to (1,2)
- Move to (2,2)
- Move to (2,3)
- End at (3,3)

Output this path as:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
