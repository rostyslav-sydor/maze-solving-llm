To solve the maze using the adjacency list provided, we can construct a graph to represent the maze. The graph nodes are the coordinates, and the edges are the connections defined in the adjacency list. We'll then use a search algorithm to find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Analyzing the adjacency list:
- It provides a direct connection between coordinates, indicating where movement between spaces is possible.

Using a simplified pathfinding method like breadth-first search (BFS):

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore each neighbor that is connected as per the adjacency list.
3. Continue exploring until the target (3,3) is reached, ensuring to track the path.

From the adjacency list:
- Start at (0,0) connected to (0,1). 
- Then (0,1) to (0,2). 
- (0,2) to (1,2). 
- (1,2) to (1,3). 
- (1,3) to (2,3). 
- And finally, (2,3) to (3,3), which is the target.

The path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. 

This sequence follows the available connections given in the adjacency list to reach from the origin to the target.
