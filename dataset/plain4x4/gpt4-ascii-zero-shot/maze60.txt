Based on the adjacency list provided and the specified origin and target coordinates, I determined the solution for the maze by following the given connected paths from the origin to the target.

1. Start at origin (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1).
3. Move from (0,1) to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), move to (2,1).
5. Move from (2,1) to (2,2).
6. Move from (2,2) to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), move to (3,3) which is the target.

The solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
