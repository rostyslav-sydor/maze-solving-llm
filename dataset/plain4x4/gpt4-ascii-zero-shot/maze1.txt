From the ASCII representation provided and understanding it as a list of connected vertices in a grid:

1. The maze is described using an adjacency list format, where pairs of coordinates are connected.
2. The starting point (S) of the maze is (1,1) and the exit (E) is at (3,3).

Given the maze description using an adjacency list:
- The graph clearly identifies paths between neighboring cells (given in the form (row, column)).
  
To solve:
- A path should be found from starting point (1,1) to the exit (3,3).
- Standard searches like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) can be deployed. Here, let's assume we're using BFS for simplicity.

From the description:
- Start BFS from (1,1).
- Initially, from (1,1) you can move to (1,2), as (1,1) <--> (1,2).
- Then from (1,2) to (2,2), as (1,2) <--> (2,2).
- Continue to (2,3), as (2,2) <--> (2,3).
- Next to (3,3), as (2,3) <--> (3,3), which is the target.

Thus, the pathway will be as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
