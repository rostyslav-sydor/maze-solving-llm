To solve the maze given via adjacency list and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we first need to decode these edges and nodes to visualize and travel through the maze.

From the adjacency list:
- Convert each pair of coordinates into a relationship map for easy path tracking.
  
Graph Construct (based on adjacency list in problem description):
- Direct connections showing possible movements (ignoring walls):
  ```
  (2,1) <=> (1,1); (3,1) <=> (3,0); (1,3) <=> (2,3); (0,3) <=> (1,3);
  (2,1) <=> (2,0); (1,0) <=> (0,0); (1,2) <=> (0,2); (3,3) <=> (2,3);
  (0,1) <=> (0,0); (3,0) <=> (2,0); (2,2) <=> (2,3); (2,2) <=> (3,2); 
  (3,1) <=> (3,2); (0,3) <=> (0,2); (0,1) <=> (0,2);
  ```

A visual translation assuming S=(0,0) and E=(3,3). We construct and then implement search algorithm.

Using BFS/DFS to find path from S to E:
1. Start BFS from (0,0).
2. Visit and queue each adjacent node, marking as visited.
3. Continue until (3,3) is reached.

Path from BFS (abbreviated steps):
- Start at (0,0) -> reachable directly to (0,1), (1,0)
- Continue expansion, record path till (3,3) is reached.

BFS results in the solution:
<Response>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
