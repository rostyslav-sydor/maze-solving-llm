Based on the adjacency list provided in your question, I will determine the sequence of coordinates to get from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

Given the adjacency list:
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (2,3) <-> (2,2)
- (1,1) <-> (1,2)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (2,2) <-> (2,1)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)

Solution pathway:
Starting at the origin (0,0) and using adjacency rules to find the path to (3,3):

- Start at (0,0).
- By adjacency, move to (0,1).
- Then move to (0,2).
- Next to (0,3).
- Then to (1,3) as it connects from (0,3).
- Continue to (1,2), (1,1), move downwards to (2,1), and further to (2,2).
- Move to (2,3), then to (3,3).

Path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
