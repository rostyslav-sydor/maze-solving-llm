To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the given adjacency list format, I'll use a classic pathfinding algorithm, such as BFS (Breadth-First Search). Based on the adjacency list, I'll create a map of connections and then perform the BFS to find the shortest path between the origin and the target.

Step 1: Create a map from the adjacency list:
```
(0,2) <-> [(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)]
(1,2) <-> [(1,3), (2,3), (0,2)]
and so on...
```

Step 2: Implementing BFS:
- Start at (0,0).
- Visit every connected point, keeping track of already visited nodes to avoid cycles.
- Proceed until the target (3,3) is found.

Following this method and utilizing the connections from each coordinate in the adjacency list, the path found can be traced back from the target to the origin.

Given the correctly resolved adjacency connections and BFS exploration:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path respects the adjacency and ensures it navigates through reachable cells, successfully leading from the origin to the target in the maze.
