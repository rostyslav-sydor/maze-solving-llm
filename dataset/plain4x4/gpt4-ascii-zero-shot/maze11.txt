Given the adjacency list representation of the maze's paths among cells:

- (3,0) <-> (2,0), (1,2) <-> (1,3), (3,0) <-> (3,1), (1,3) <-> (0,3), (0,2) <-> (0,1), (0,1) <-> (0,0), (2,3) <-> (3,3), (1,1) <-> (1,0), (2,2) <-> (3,2), (2,1) <-> (2,2), (1,2) <-> (0,2), (2,1) <-> (2,0), (1,3) <-> (2,3), (3,3) <-> (3,2), (1,0) <-> (0,0)

Starting at (0,0) (the maze's given entry point) and targeting (3,3) (exit point):

1. From (0,0), we can go to (1,0) then (1,1): the actual entry point of the maze as per your reference.
2. From (1,1), to (1,2), then to (1,3).
3. From (1,3), we can alternatively go to (2,3) or to (0,3). Since (0,3) goes back to the start, we go to (2,3).
4. From (2,3), go to (3,3) for the exit.

Here's the path:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates provides a valid solution to reach from the maze's start point 'S' at (1,1) to the exit point 'E' at (3,3).
