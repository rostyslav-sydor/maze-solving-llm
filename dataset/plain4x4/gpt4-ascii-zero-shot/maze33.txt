To solve this maze using the adjacency list provided, let's follow the connections between cells, beginning from the origin coordinate (0,0) and moving towards the target coordinate (3,3). Note that each coordinate (x,y) indicates a specific cell in the maze grid with the adjacency list presenting which cells are directly connected.

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Travel to (0,1) as indicated by (0,0) <--> (0,1).
3. Proceed to (0,2), following (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. Move to (0,3), according to (0,2) <--> (0,3).
5. Shift to (1,3) via (1,3) <--> (0,3).
6. Then go to (2,3) as (2,3) <--> (1,3).
7. Finally, head to the target (3,3) using (2,3) <--> (3,3).

Each step has pathways directly connected based on the adjacency list, leading you from the entry to the exit point.

The path from the start to the end of the maze, in coordinate format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
