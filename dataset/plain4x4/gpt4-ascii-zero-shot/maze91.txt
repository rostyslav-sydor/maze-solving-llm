To solve this maze, I will treat the adjacency list as a graph and apply a search algorithm to find the path from the origin point to the target. Let's use the adjacency list provided to execute a breadth-first search (BFS).

The adjacency list can be interpreted as:
- (2,2) connects to (1,2)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3)
- (1,3) connects to (1,2)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1) and (2,2)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0) and (2,1)
- (3,1) connects to (2,1)
- (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- (0,2) connects to (0,3)
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1)

Starting the BFS search at the origin (0,0) and searching until reaching the target (3,3), calculate the shortest path:

1. Visit (0,0), enqueue adjacent node (0,1).
2. Visit (0,1), enqueue adjacent nodes (1,1) and (0,2).
3. Visit (1,1), enqueue adjacent node (1,2).
4. Visit (0,2), enqueue adjacent node (0,3).
5. Visit (1,2), enqueue adjacent nodes (2,2) and (1,3).
6. Visit (0,3), enqueue adjacent node (1,3).
7. Visit (2,2), enqueue adjacent node (3,2).
8. Visit (1,3), enqueue adjacent node (2,3).
9. Visit (3,2), enqueue adjacent nodes (3,1) and (3,3).
10. Visit (2,3), has adjacent node (3,3) which is the target.

The path found from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:

**<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>**

This path is confirmed by backtracking the BFS parent links from the target to the origin after the search completes.
