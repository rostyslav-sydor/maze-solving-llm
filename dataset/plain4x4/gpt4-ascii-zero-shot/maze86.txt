To solve the given ASCII maze, we need to interpret the adjacency list representation provided and determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list gives all possible connections between nodes (maze cells) that can be directly navigated.

The nodes in the list represent different coordinates in the maze, and if two nodes are connected, you can move directly between them (no wall in between). Hence, we will use this information to construct a path.

Following the adjacency list, we trace a route from the origin to the target:
1. Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1) based on the adjacency of (0,1) <--> (0,0)
2. Then move to (0,2) based on (0,2) <--> (0,1)
3. Move to (1,2) per (1,2) <--> (0,2)
4. From (1,2) go to (2,2) as given by (1,2) <--> (2,2)
5. Move to (2,3) based on (2,2) <--> (2,3)
6. Finally, move to (3,3) from (2,3), indicated by (2,3) <--> (3,3)

The resultant path from the origin to the target is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
