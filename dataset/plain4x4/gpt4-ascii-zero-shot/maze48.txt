To solve the maze, we need to interpret the ASCII adjacency list, find a path from the origin to the target using any suitable algorithm like BFS or DFS, and then provide the path in the specified format.

From the given adjacency list, converting maze coordinates and connections:

- Start point `(0,0)` maps to `(1,1)` on our 0-indexed grid.
- End point `(3,3)` maps to `(7,7)`.

Analyzing the adjacency link in usual grid coordinates:
```
(1, 0) <>
(2, 0) — (3, 0)
(0, 1) — (0, 0)
(0, 3) — (0, 2)
(2, 2) — (3, 2)
(1, 3) — (1, 2)
(3, 2) — (3, 3)
(2, 3) — (3, 3)
(1, 1) — (2, 1)
(2, 2) — (2, 1)
(3, 0) — (3, 1)
(1, 3) — (2, 3)
(0, 1) — (0, 2)
(3, 1) — (3, 2)
(1, 2) — (0, 2)
(1, 0) — (1, 1)
```

The solution involves traversing this mapped adjacency list from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`. Using a path-finding algorithm, we deduce:

- Start at `(1, 1)`.
- Move to `(1, 2)`
- Move to `(1, 3)`
- Move to `(2, 3)`.
- Move to `(3, 3)`.

The correct answer in the desired format would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
