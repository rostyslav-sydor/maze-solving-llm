Based on the adjacency list given for the maze:

- Entry point, labeled as (0,0) in the system, corresponds to (1,1) in ASCII maze.
- Exit point, labeled as (3,3) in the system, corresponds to (7,7) in ASCII maze.

The edges in the adjacency list indicate the paths available between the nodes (coordinates) with the following connections:

```
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,1) <--> (2,1)
(1,3) <--> (1,2)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
```

Using these edges, we need to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1).
3. Move to (0,2).
4. Move to (0,3).
5. Move to (1,3).
6. Move to (2,3).
7. Move to (3,3), which is the exit.

This ensures that each step, as shown, connects to the next via the adjacency list.

Outputting this solution between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` markers:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
