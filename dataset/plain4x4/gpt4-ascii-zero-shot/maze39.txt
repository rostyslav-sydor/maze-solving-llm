To solve this maze, we'll use the adjacency list provided to construct a path from the starting coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3). We'll apply a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

From the adjacency list:
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (0,1) connects to both (0,2) and (1,1)
- (0,2) connects to (1,2)
- (1,2) connects to both (1,1) and (2,2)
- (2,2) connects to both (2,3) and (1,3)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3)
- (1,1) connects to (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0)
- (2,3) connects to both (3,3) and (1,3)
- (3,3) also connects to (3,2)
- Start at (0,0)
- Goal is (3,3)

Using BFS, the shortest path we find is:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (0,2)
- Move to (1,2)
- Move to (2,2)
- Move to (2,3)
- Move to (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
