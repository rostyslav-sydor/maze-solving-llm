Based on the details given, we must find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) in the maze using the adjacency list provided. The list defines possible movements between grid coordinates.

Using the information from the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (0,3) via (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3).
3. Move from (0,3) to (3,3) via (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Thus, the required path is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
