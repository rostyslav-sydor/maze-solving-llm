To solve this maze, we first need to understand its representation through the adjacency list given, which details the connectivity between various points:

- (0,0) connects with (0,1) and (1,0).
- (0,1) connects with (0,0) and (0,2).
- (0,2) connects with (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2).
- (0,3) connects with (0,2) and (1,3).
- and so on for other coordinates.

Given that entry is at (1,1) and exit is at (3,3), initiating a pathfinding mechanism (like breadth-first search) would help us discover the shortest path from the origin to the target:

1. Start at (1,1), from where only (1,2) and (1,0) can be reached.
2. From (1,2), the next step can lead to (0,2) or continue to (0,3) or (1,1).
3. Continuing this exploration pattern, looking for a sequence that ultimately reaches (3,3) through connected nodes.

Following BFS and considering the connections, one of the shortest paths would be:
(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Thus, presented as requested:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
