To find the solution for the maze where each cell can be distinguished by its coordinates with the designated entry at (0,0) and the exit at (4,4):

1. I start from the given entry point at (0,0).
2. Observing the maze from the image:
   - There is a clear passage from (0,0) to (0,1) (going east).
   - Continue from (0,1) to (0,2) as there is no barrier.
   - From (0,2), move straight down to (1,2) and then to (2,2) because the path vertically downwards is clear.
   - Move from (2,2) to (2,3) as the path to the right is open.
   - Go down from (2,3) to (3,3).
   - Move to the right from (3,3) to (3,4).
   - Finally, descend from (3,4) to the exit point at (4,4).

Thus, following this analysis, the path finding through the maze can be summarized as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves walks through the openings in the walls without hitting any dead ends, and successfully maps a valid and clear route from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
