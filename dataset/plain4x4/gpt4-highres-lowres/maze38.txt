To solve the maze given by the adjacency list and find a path from the origin to the target, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this kind of problem as it explores neighbors level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target, it has found the shortest path.

Given the adjacency list:
- Nodes and their respective connections imply which cells in a maze are directly accessible from one another.

We start from the origin point (0,0) and progressively explore all possible paths using the connections provided in the adjacency list until we reach the target point (3,3). The BFS approach utilizes a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, and a set or dictionary to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.

Based on the adjacency list provided:
- Parse the list to create a graph representation (using a dictionary where keys are nodes, and values are lists of connected nodes).
- Initiate BFS from the origin, marking nodes as visited by adding them to a dictionary or set, and recording the path taken to reach each node.
- Upon reaching the target node, backtrack using the recorded paths to determine the route taken.

By carefully applying BFS and backtracking, we find the solution path. For the specific maze described:

Starting from (0,0), following BFS:
1. From (0,0) you can go to (0,1) and from there to (0,2).
2. From (0,2) move to (0,3).
3. From (0,3) progress to (1,3).
4. From (1,3) backtrack slightly to (1,2).
5. Move from (1,2) to (2,2).
6. From (2,2) go to (3,2).
7. Then move from (3,2) to the final target (3,3).

Every step uses direct connections from the adjacency list. This method guarantees finding the shortest path (if one exists), as BFS explores all shortest paths from the start node before moving to paths that are one step longer.

Thus, the solution to this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
