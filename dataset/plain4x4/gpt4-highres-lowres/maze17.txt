To solve the maze presented, I analyzed the configuration of walls and open paths cell by cell. The methodology involved examining possible moves from each cell while adhering to the constraint imposed by the walls. The objective is to navigate from the starting point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,4).

Here is a step-by-step walkthrough based on the visual interpretation of the maze:

1. Start at (0,0), which is the entry point. Since the cell directly to the right (0,1) is open, move there.
2. From (0,1), move right to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), there is a wall blocking the passage right and downward. Thus, move left back to (0,1) and then down to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), move down to (2,1) as moving right is not an option due to a wall.
5. From (2,1), move right to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), move down to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), move right to (3,3).
8. From (3,3), move down to (4,3) near the bottom row, since moving right is blocked by a wall.
9. From (4,3), move right to the final destination at (4,4), which is the exit point.

Each move is chosen such that it avoids walls and progresses towards the exit:

Final solution path for the maze, provided in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END>
