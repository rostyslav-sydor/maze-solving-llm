To solve the maze from the image provided, you want to create a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), navigating through open cells and avoiding walls represented by the thick black lines.

Here's the reasoning for solving the maze:
1. Start at the top-left corner (0,0).
2. You can move right to (0,1) since there is no wall blocking this path on the right.
3. From (0,1), you can move right again to (0,2) as the path remains open.
4. The grid at (0,3) is open to move right from (0,2).
5. At (0,3), you need to move downward to (1,3) because moving right is not an option; that would exit the maze layout.
6. From (1,3), continue downward to (2,3).
7. Finally, move right from (2,3) to (2,4) and further to (3,4). However, navigating back to (3,3) will make you directly align with the existing path, as the intended exit by description seems to be (3,3).

Thus, the path in the explained sequence would be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This series of moves takes you from the entry to the exit point of the maze, carefully avoiding all walls and successfully navigating through the path.
