Given the maze representation as an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. The adjacency list presents each connection between coordinates, indicating which squares are accessible from each other.

Let's reason through this and identify a valid path by tracing connections from the start to the end point:

1. Start at `(0,0)`. According to the adjacency list, from `(0,0)` you can go to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, you can progress to `(0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, you have a direct link to `(0,3)`.
4. Although we are at row `0`, the end point `(3,3)` is at row `3`. You can move from `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)`, you can continue moving down the maze to `(1,2)`.
6. From `(1,2)`, move back to `(1,3)` (though it doesn't help in progressing toward the target).
7. From `(1,3)`, connecting back to `(0,3)` repeats earlier steps.
8. Continuing from the other direction, moving from `(1,3)` back up to `(0,3)` is less productive, but from `(0,3)` we need to find a link going deeper into the maze.
9. The best way is to then move directly vertically downward from `(0,3)` to `(1,3)`, then to `(2,3)`.
10. From `(2,3)`, continue vertically to `(3,3)`, which is the target.

Based on this tracing through the adjacency list and moving logically from the starting position toward the target, we construct the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is a direct and continuous path connecting the origin to the target through the available paths outlined in the adjacency list.
