To find the solution for this maze, you begin at the entry point specified at coordinates (0,0) and explore available paths by moving through openings in the walls. Moving through each available cell adjacent to your current position without crossing a thick black line, your aim is to reach the exit point at (4,4). Here's the approach to solving the maze from the given image:

1. Start at (0,0), the only move possible is to (1,0) as the right is blocked.
2. From (1,0), you can move down to (2,0) since right and up are blocked.
3. At (2,0), move to (3,0) as right is blocked.
4. From (3,0), move to (3,1) to the right, as it is open.
5. Then proceed to (3,2).
6. Now, move upward to (2,2) from (3,2).
7. Next, move from (2,2) to (1,2).
8. Then move to the right, from (1,2) to (1,3).
9. And from (1,3) move down to (2,3).
10. Move right from (2,3) to (2,4) and then up to (1,4).
11. Finally, proceed from (1,4) to the exit (0,4).

Following through with the above path description, you bypass walls and reach the exit efficiently. Here is the result in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (1,4) (0,4) <PATH_END>
