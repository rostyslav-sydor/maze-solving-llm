To solve the maze described using the adjacency list, we would typically use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). These algorithms are suitable because they systematically explore all possible paths in the graph to find the shortest path (BFS) or just any path (DFS) from the start to the target.

The adjacency list provided describes all possible moves from each position, effectively showing all the edges in the maze's graph. Starting from the origin, we explore available paths, moving from node to node based on the provided connections till we find the path that reaches the target.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Start at (0,0) and explore neighbors. The adjacency list includes moves from (0,0) to (0,1).
- From (0,1), continue to explore, reaching (0,2) and then (0,3).
- From (0,3), according to the adjacency list, it's connected to (1,3).
- Continue from (1,3) to (1,2) and explore possible connections.
- Notice you can now move from (1,2) to (1,3) again, but that would lead us back, so the option to consider next would be connections from (1,3) to (0,3).
- Continue from here to other adjacent nodes till we find a path to (3,3).

Each step involves exploring adjacent nodes, marking nodes as visited to avoid loops, and backtracking if no forward path is available.

Given this setup and following through the exploration using the connections provided in the adjacency list, we find that the path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution implies a straightforward traverse through connected paths, tracing a path that effectively moves from the leftmost column upwards, then progressively through the connection straight to the target at the last row and column.
