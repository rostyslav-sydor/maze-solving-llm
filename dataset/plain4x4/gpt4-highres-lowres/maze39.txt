Analyzing the information provided in the adjacency list, the maze consists of several interconnected pathways between different coordinate points on a grid. To solve this maze and find a route from the specified entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3), a path through the connected nodes should take advantage of the adjacency relationships provided.

From the adjacency list:
- The entrance, or origin, is at (0,0) and connects directly to (0,1).
- The path's target, or exit point, is situated at (3,3).

The path can be traced by following connecting coordinates, ensuring a connected sequence without breaks, ideally using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach typically used for traversing graphs.

Following each connection point-by-point:
1. Start at (0,0), connects to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), advance to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), which itself can move forward to (0,3).
4. Continue from (0,3), which is connected to (1,3).
5. At (1,3), move to (1,2) due to their connection.
6. From (1,2), you donâ€™t have a direct connection to further the path towards the target; hence backtrack slightly to (1,3) and reconsider other navigable paths.
7. Analyzing other connections, consider moving again but focusing on a different route which may include (2,1) given its multiple connecting options.
8. (0,3) to (1,3) and then from (1,3) also connected back to (1,2) if needed or preferably push towards (2,2) or (2,3).
9. From (1,3) moving down to (2,3) which connects directly to (3,3) where the path concludes.

Formulating these points gives us:
- (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Thus, the complete solution for the maze, chronicled from start to target endpoint, can be presented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This pathway leverages the connectivity given in your adjacency list, showcasing a feasible and direct route through the maze from the specific origin to the target without stepping into loops or redundant paths.
