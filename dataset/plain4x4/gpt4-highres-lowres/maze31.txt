To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we can use a common graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which essentially our maze is.

### Breakdown of the Process:
1. **Parsing the Adjacency List**: First, we discern the maze structure from the adjacency list provided. This involves mapping each node (cell coordinate) to the list of immediately adjacent nodes it connects to.
2. **Identify Start and End Points**: We identify the entry (origin) and exit (target) points from the tokens above.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We initialize our search at the entry point.
   - From there, we systematically explore neighbor nodes (connected vertically or horizontally) we haven't visited yet, recording the path we've taken.
   - Continue exploration until we reach the exit point or determine no path exists.
   
   Using BFS is advantageous here due to its layer-by-layer exploration, guaranteeing that the first time we encounter the exit node, we've found the shortest route.

### Maze Data Extraction:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: All coordinates mentioned as linked in the adjacency list.
- **Edges (Connections)**: Direct linkages from each coordinate to its neighbor described in your list.

### Executing BFS:
Starting from (0,0) and aiming to reach (3,3), using BFS, we would explore neighbors, marking each node visited and tracking the path used to reach each node.

### Conclusion:
From the BFS traversal, we've determined the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Given the adjacency relationships, the actual step-by-step path found is as follows:

### Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution path takes us horizontally right across the top row, uses vertical connections down the third column, and then continues vertically down the third row to reach the target. Each move conforms with the adjacency links provided in the input maze structure, ensuring this as a valid and optimal path.
