To find the solution to the maze, observe the walls and paths that connect entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3):

1. Start at the top left cell (0,0).
2. The first movement can be to the right to (0,1) since there is no wall blocking the path.
3. From (0,1), move further right to (0,2).
4. At (0,2), we can only move vertically downward to (1,2) since the path to the right is blocked by a wall.
5. From (1,2), move down again to (2,2).
6. At (2,2), move right to (2,3) as this is the only path open.
7. Finally, move from (2,3) down to the exit at (3,3).

This gives us the solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
