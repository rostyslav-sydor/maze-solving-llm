To find a solution to this maze, we can visually inspect the image and plot a path that navigates through open passages, avoiding the walls. We start at the maze's entry point, (0,0), and traverse through adjacent open cells to reach the exit point at (3,3).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the path:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to the right to (0,1) since moving downward is blocked by a wall.
3. Move to the right again to (0,2).
4. Move downward to (1,2) because moving right from (0,2) is blocked.
5. Move downward again to (2,2).
6. Move to the right to (2,3) because moving downward is blocked.
7. Move downward to (3,3).

We'll now write out the path in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This route effectively navigates through the maze from the entrance to the exit, following the open passages and avoiding all walls.
