To solve the maze, we'll analyze the possible paths that can be taken from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,4). Specifically, we need to find a path that avoids the walls, indicated by the thick black lines. We'll trace this path by moving through cells where no obstructions are present. 

Starting at the top-left corner of the maze (0,0), the analysis goes as follows:
1. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) since it's an open path.
2. From (0,1), move down to (1,1) as the east side (0,2) is blocked.
3. Continue from (1,1) to (2,1) as the east side (1,2) is blocked.
4. From (2,1) move to (2,2) since it's unblocked.
5. Next, move from (2,2) to (2,3), following the open route.
6. From (2,3), move down to (3,3)—the direct path to the right (2,4) and down (3,2) are blocked.
7. Then move further down from (3,3) to (4,3) as it’s open.
8. Finally, from (4,3), move east to the exit point at (4,4).

Following this sequence, the path through the maze can be summarized as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) <PATH_END> 

This analysis ensures a successful journey from the entry to the exit without encountering any walls, considering the visual structure provided by the maze.
