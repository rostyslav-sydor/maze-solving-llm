To find a solution path through the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), I'll analyze the image step by step, checking possible directions (up, down, left, right) and avoiding walls.

### Analysis and Reasoning:
1. The entry point is at the top left corner (0,0).
2. From (0,0), you can only move down to (1,0) because moving right is blocked by a wall.
3. From (1,0), you can move further down to (2,0).
4. From (2,0), moving right to (2,1) is possible.
5. From (2,1), there are two options, moving down to (3,1) or moving right to (2,2).
6. From (3,1), you can move right to (3,2).
7. From (3,2), complete the path by moving right to the exit point (3,3).

### Solution
Using this analysis, I will put together the path coordinates:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This sequence of steps leads from the starting cell (0,0) to the exit cell (3,3) while navigating through the passages available and avoiding walls.
