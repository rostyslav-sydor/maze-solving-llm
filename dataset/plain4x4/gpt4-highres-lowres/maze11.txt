To solve the maze, I first examined the layout to determine the accessible paths from the starting point at (0,0) and how they could reach the exit at (4,4). The solution for the maze requires tracing a path while avoiding walls, ensuring we only move through open spaces between the cells.

Given this maze:
- Starting at the top-left corner (0,0), the only open path initially is to move right.
- From (0,0) move to (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3) successfully as the path is open.
- A wall blocks the movement from (0,3) to (0,4), so the next available move is to go down to (1,3).
- Moving from (1,3) to (2,3), then down to (3,3).
- From (3,3), move right to (3,4).
- Finally, continue moving down to reach (4,4).

Thus, the steps are planned from the start to the exit following the directions where no walls obstruct the path, ensuring every subsequent move is valid by continuously checking adjacent cells.

Now let's output the solution in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
