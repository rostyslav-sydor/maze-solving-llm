To solve the maze, letâ€™s explore the paths cell by cell, starting from the entry point (0,0) until we reach the exit point (3,3). We'll identify possible moves by examining the open paths (without any walls blocking the way) and navigate through the grid accordingly:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. From (0,0), the only open path leads to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), there is a wall blocking the path directly south, move to (0,3).
5. From (0,3), you can go south to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), continue moving south to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), move to (3,3) which is the exit.

Thus, the path through the maze from the entry to the exit is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
