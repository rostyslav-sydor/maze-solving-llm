To solve this maze, we start from the entry point at (0, 0) and attempt to reach the exit point at (3, 3), avoiding any obstacles (walls) that block the path between adjacent cells. 

Starting at (0, 0), only the rightward move to (0, 1) is possible since moving down to (1, 0) is blocked by a wall. From (0, 1), neither a downward move to (1, 1) nor a rightward move to (0, 2) is possible due to the walls; thus, the only option is to move back to (0, 0). At this juncture, there's no feasible path forward, so we reassess from the beginning.

We can now explore moving down to (1, 0), then further down to (2, 0) because the wall only blocks the rightward pathway. From (2, 0), moving down to (3, 0) and consequently to the right to (3, 1) is feasible. Further rightward paths from (3, 1) to (3, 2), and then from (3, 2) to (3, 3) are open, thus completing the route from entry to exit.

Transcribing this into the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
