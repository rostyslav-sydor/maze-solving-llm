To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin to the target point, which are (0,0) and (3,3) respectively. The solution involves navigating through the graph using the adjacency connections until the exit point is reached.

From the adjacency list, it is clear that movements are allowed between directly connected coordinates. We can start tracing the path from the starting coordinate, checking each possible movement against our list to build a valid path to the target point.

1. Start at the origin: (0,0). Check the connections: (0,0) <--> (0,1)
2. Move to (0,1). Check connections: (0,1) <--> (0,0), (0,1) <--> (0,2)
3. Move to (0,2). Check connections: (0,2) <--> (0,1), (0,2) <--> (0,3)
4. Move to (0,3). Check connections: (0,3) <--> (0,2), (0,3) <--> (1,3)
5. Move to (1,3). Check connections: (1,3) <--> (0,3), (1,3) <--> (1,2)
6. Move to (1,2). Check connections: (1,2) <--> (1,3)
7. Unable to progress beyond (1,2) and need to retrace: move back to (1,3) and check alternative routes
8. Retrace back to (0,3) and move differently to (1,3) again, using a previously unexplored part of the maze from (1,3) further.
9. Continue to (2,3). Check connections: (2,3) <--> (3,3)
10. Move to (3,3). Arrival at the target point.

The path traced through the maze involves moving through coordinates by respecting the adjacency relations until reaching the target farthest point of (3,3). Ensuring that each move is allowed according to the adjacency relations provided is key. The shortest path found through this approach integrates as much of the breadth of the graph as needed without unnecessary retracements.

In conclusion, the solution based on the adjacency list while keeping track of visited locations to avoid loops and repeatedly traveled pathways yields the shortest route to the exit:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
