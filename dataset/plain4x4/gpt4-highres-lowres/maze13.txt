To solve the maze, we analyze the possible paths from the entrance at (0,0) considering the barriers represented by the thick black lines. Our objective is to navigate to the exit at (4,4) while adhering to accessible paths. I'll trace the path by strategically moving through open paths, avoiding walls.

From the starting point at (0,0):
1. The only available move is right to (0,1) since moving down is blocked.
2. From (0,1), move right again to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move right to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), move down to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), continue moving down to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move right to (2,4).
7. From (2,4), move down to (3,4).
8. From (3,4), move down to (4,4), which is the exit.

Thus, the solution for navigating through this maze from start (0,0) to exit (4,4) while following the open paths avoiding walls is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) <PATH_END>
