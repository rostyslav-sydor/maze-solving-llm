To find a solution for this maze, one must trace a path from the start point at coordinate (0,0) to the exit point at coordinate (3,3) while navigating through the allowable passages, which are the areas not blocked by a wall.

Hereâ€™s the analysis of the maze:
1. Starting at (0,0), you can move right to (0,1) and (0,2) but can't directly proceed to (0,3) because of a wall.
2. From (0,2), you can move downward to (1,2) and then to (2,2).
3. From (2,2), there's no passage directly down to (3,2) due to another wall, so you need to move to the right to (2,3).
4. From (2,3), you can move down to (3,3).

Thus, a valid path has been determined from the entrance to the exit without violating any wall constraints.

Here is the solution in the specified format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
