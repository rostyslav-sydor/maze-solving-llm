To solve the maze described, itâ€™s essential to understand that the graph's nodes represent coordinates in the maze and the edges represent permissible paths between these coordinates. Given your adjacency list, I need to find the shortest path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

Since Breadth-First Search (BFS) is excellent for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, I utilized it for pathfinding in your maze. BFS explores neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted setting like this one. Here's a step-by-step exploration analysis:

1. **Start from origin (0,0)**: Explore all directly connected nodes.
2. **Explore Neighbors**: From (0,0), I can move to (0,1).
3. **Continue exploring**: From (0,1), we can move to (0,2).
4. **Keep going**: From (0,2), explore to (0,3).
5. **Further Exploration**: From (0,3), possible movements are to (1,3).
6. **Press on**: From (1,3), path options include (1,2).
7. **Move ahead**: From (1,2), navigate to (2,2).
8. **Approach the destination**: From (2,2), move to (3,2).
9. **On to the target**: Finally, from (3,2) move to (3,3), reaching the target.

The path explored efficiently finds the way from (0,0) to (3,3) using connections provided. Each move was directly supported by the adjacencies in the list and carefully picked to ensure a continuous path without backtracking unnecessarily:

**Solution**: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path forms a connected line from the start to the finish, utilizing available routes without repetition and ensuring the shortest path under the graph's constraints.
