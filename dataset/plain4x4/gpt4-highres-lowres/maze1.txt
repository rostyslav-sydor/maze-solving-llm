To solve the maze, starting from the entry point (0,0), it is important to understand and navigate around the walls marked by the thick black lines, ensuring a path is opened from the start to the exit point (3,3).

Observing the maze, the wall configuration allows for the following logical moves:

1. Start at (0,0), move to the right because the route down is blocked by a wall.
2. Continue to (0,1), proceed to the right because the route downward is blocked.
3. From (0,2), move down to (1,2) as it's the only available move.
4. From (1,2), move right to (1,3) as moving downward is blocked by another wall.
5. From (1,3), step downward to (2,3), further movement to the right is not necessary, as it touches the maze boundary.
6. From (2,3), continue downward to (3,3) which is the exit point.

Here is the full solution in specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This solution ensures that the path navigates through unblocked cells from entrance to egress, obeying the set constraints of the maze.
