In solving this maze, the approach typically involves visually tracing available paths from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3), while avoiding any walls represented by the thick black lines.

We start at cell (0,0). From this point:

1. Move horizontally from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3) since these cells are open and connected in the maze.
2. Move vertically downward from (0,3) to (1,3), (2,3), and finally to (3,3).

By following this path, there is no need to backtrack or try alternate routes since it leads directly from the entrance to the exit without encountering any barriers.

Therefore, the solution in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
