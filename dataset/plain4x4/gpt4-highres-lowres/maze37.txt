To solve this maze, we need to identify a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. The adjacency list shows direct connections between cells in a grid-like format, allowing us to understand which cells are directly reachable from others.

First, we interpret the maze's structure through the adjacency list given. From each node, we see the directly connected nodes, effectively describing a graph.

**Step-by-step path traversal:**

1. Start at the origin, (0,0).
2. From (0,0) move to (0,1) as per the connection in the adjacency list.
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), access (0,3).
5. Travel from (0,3) down to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), traverse to (1,2).
7. Move from (1,2) back to (1,3) because it allows us to access an initially unreachable node (2,3).
8. Then move from (1,3) to (0,3) and to (1,3) before heading to (2,3).
9. From (2,3), reach the final target, (3,3).

This path was chosen because it allows moving through each connected node from the start to the target without retracing steps over previously traversed paths that wouldn't lead directly to the endpoint. Some backtracking occurred naturally due to the connectivity structure provided and the need to access ports to continue moving closer to the target.

**Final proposed solution path:**  
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that from each node, a connection exists to the next node, conforming to the adjacency list, and ultimately navigates from the origin to the target effectively.
