To solve the maze, we first interpret the given adjacency list which outlines the connections between different coordinates within the maze. The list details which coordinates (interpreted as nodes) are directly connected (edges in the graph). To find a pathway from the entry to the exit of the maze, we traverse this network using an appropriate pathfinding algorithm like Breadth First Search (BFS) or Depth First Search (DFS). These algorithms are suitable because they can systematically explore all possible paths from a starting node to the targeted exit node.

However, given the provided information, we may manually deduce a possible path since this maze is relatively small. The starting point is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). Using the adjacency list, we can map out a potential route.

Here is the adjacency breakdown:
- From (0,0) we can move to (0,1)
- Then from (0,1) there are links to (0,2) and (0,0), we choose (0,2) to progress further.
- From (0,2) we can move to (0,3) as the next step.
- At junction (0,3), moving downward to (1,3) is feasible.
- From (1,3), we move left to (1,2).
- Then from (1,2) back to (1,3) but since it's a backtrack, we disregard it. Instead, we can go down to (2,3).
- From (2,3) the path connects directly to the exit at (3,3).

Assembling this reasoning concretely results in the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path avoids backtracking and provides a direct sequence from the entrance to the exit based on the provided adjacency relationships among the points in the maze.
