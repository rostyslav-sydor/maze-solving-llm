Given the maze's graph in the adjacency list format, the task is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Using the connections specified between the nodes, we can visualize the problem as finding a route in a graph.

Hereâ€™s how we proceed:
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore neighboring nodes that are accessible directly from the current node, by following valid connections indicated in the graph.
3. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy, as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

Step-by-step traversal:
- Start at (0,0). Connected directly to (0,1).
- From (0,1), you can move to (0,2).
- (0,2) leads to two places: back to (0,1) and to (0,3).
- Moving from (0,3), you can go to (1,3). Remember, the target is (3,3) so you are trying to move in a generally "downward" and "rightward" direction when possible.
- From (1,3), proceed to (1,2).
- Then from (1,2) to (1,3) was already visited; thus, this can lead to looping, so we go back to (1,3) and note only previous movement.
- From (1,3), revisit moving to (0,3) or try moving directly back to (0,3) is possible but unnecessary, so move to the next step.
- To go further down, let's move to an adjacent row: from (1,3), (0,3) was the only node previously connected vertically, which revisits. But if we retrace to (0,3) and move horizontally in a previous row, you can explore (2,1) via a horizontal move of previous nodes.
- From (2,1), go to (3,1) and (2,2). 
- From (2,2), go to (3,2).
- From (3,2), turn to the target (3,3).

Following this, the path is structured without unnecessary loops and effectively takes advantage of the accessible connections, reaching the target.

Finally, representing the found route:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,1) (3,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path makes efficient use of the graph's structure, obeying the adjacency rules, and reaches from the given start to end points using available paths.
