First, we need to identify the possible paths we can take from the starting point at (0,0) to the target point at (3,3) based on the given adjacency list. We can traverse through the maze by following the edges that connect the nodes.

By following the connections provided in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze, making sure to avoid any loops or dead ends. This allows us to reach the target point at (3,3) from the starting point at (0,0).

The solution path for this maze would be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the starting point to the target point, avoiding any obstacles or incorrect paths.

In summary, the solution for this maze involves traversing through the maze grid by following the connections provided in the adjacency list to reach the target point at (3,3).
