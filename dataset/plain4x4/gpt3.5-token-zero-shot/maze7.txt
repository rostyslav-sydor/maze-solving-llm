First, we need to find a path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. Following the connections, we can see that by moving through the maze, we can reach the target.

The path can be described as follows: starting at (0,0), move to (0,1), then to (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This represents the coordinates of the path taken from the origin to the target.
