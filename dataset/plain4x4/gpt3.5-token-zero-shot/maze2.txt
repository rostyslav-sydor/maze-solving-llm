First, we need to start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze. We can move through the maze by following the connections given in the adjacency list.

Following the connections, we can move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) which is our target point.

Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path follows the connections in the maze and leads us from the origin to the target point.
