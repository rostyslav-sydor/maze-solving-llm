First, we need to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) in the maze. Following the adjacency list, we start at (0,0) and move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So the path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This path successfully navigates the maze from the starting point to the target point.
