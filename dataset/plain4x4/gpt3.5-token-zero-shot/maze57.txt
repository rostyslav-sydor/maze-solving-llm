To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Starting from the origin point (0,0), we can explore the adjacent points in the adjacency list until we reach the target point (3,3).

In this case, one possible solution for the maze can be: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following the connections in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point.

This path represents a sequence of moves from one point to another until reaching the target point. This can be visualized as a series of steps taken to navigate through the maze successfully.
