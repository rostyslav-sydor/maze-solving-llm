1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze based on the adjacency list provided.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).
3. The path from (0,0) to (3,3) has been successfully found.
4. Output the path in the format of <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
5. The solution to the maze is a path from (0,0) to (3,3) consisting of the coordinates mentioned above.
