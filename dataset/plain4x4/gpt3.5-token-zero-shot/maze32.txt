1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze by following the adjacency list connections.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3).
3. Turn right and go from (0,3) to (1,3) and then down to (2,3).
4. Continue moving from (2,3) to (2,2) and then to (3,2).
5. Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3) which is the target point.
6. The solution path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).
7. So, the final output in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens is: 
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
8. This represents the optimal path through the maze from the origin point to the target point.
