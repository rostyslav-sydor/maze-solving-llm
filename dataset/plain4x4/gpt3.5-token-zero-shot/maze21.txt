1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Move to the right to (1,0), then up to (1,1), then right to (1,2), and finally up to (1,3).
3. Move to the right to (2,3), then down to (3,3).
4. Move left to (3,2), then down to (2,2), and finally left to (2,1).
5. Move down to (3,1), then left to (3,0).
6. Move up to (2,0), then left to (1,0).
7. Move up to (0,0).
8. Reach the target point at (3,3).
9. The solution path is <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (1,0) (0,0) <PATH_END>.
