To solve the maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm starting from the origin (0,0) and exploring all possible paths until reaching the target (3,3). Following the adjacency list provided, we can move from one token to another based on the connections specified.

Starting from (0,0), we can move to (0,1), (1,0), and then (1,1). From (1,1), we can continue to (1,2), and finally reach the target at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following the connections in the adjacency list and exploring all possible paths, we can successfully navigate from the origin to the target in this maze.
