First, we need to identify the paths from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the given adjacency list representation of the maze. We can start from the origin and explore the adjacent nodes until we reach the target node.

Following the paths in the adjacency list, we can navigate from (0,0) to (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally to the target (3,3). This path successfully navigates through the maze and reaches the target point.

In the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following this path, we successfully solve the maze and reach the target point.
