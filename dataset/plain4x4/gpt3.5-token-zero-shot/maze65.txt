First, we need to visualize the maze based on the given adjacency list. By examining the connections between the nodes, we can see possible paths that lead from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). It appears there are multiple ways to navigate through the maze.

One possible solution could be to start at (0,0) and move through the nodes (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) to reach the target point.

To represent this path in the requested format, we can list the coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the starting point to the target point.
