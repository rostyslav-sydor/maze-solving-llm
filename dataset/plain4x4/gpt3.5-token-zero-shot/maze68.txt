1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze by following the connections provided in the adjacency list.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally to (0,3).
3. From (0,3), move to (1,3) and then to (2,3).
4. Next, move from (2,3) to (3,3) and then to (3,2).
5. Finally, move from (3,2) to (2,2) and lastly reach the target point at (3,3).
6. The solution path can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following these steps, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point, avoiding any obstacles along the way.
