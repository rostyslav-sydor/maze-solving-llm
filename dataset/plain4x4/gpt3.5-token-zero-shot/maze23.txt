To solve the maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can visit neighboring cells based on the adjacency list provided until we reach the target at (3,3).

One possible solution path could be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This path moves from left to right at the bottom of the maze, then goes up on the right side to reach the target.

By following the connections in the adjacency list and avoiding revisiting already visited cells, we can find a valid path from the origin to the target. This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths in a systematic manner to reach the goal efficiently.
