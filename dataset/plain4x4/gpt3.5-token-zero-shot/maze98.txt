1. Start at coordinate (0,0) as marked by <ORIGIN_START>.

2. Move to (1,0), then (1,1), and (1,2) as per the adjacency list.

3. From (1,2), move to (1,3) and then to (2,3) as per the adjacency list.

4. Move from (2,3) to (3,3) to reach the target marked by <TARGET_START/END>.

5. The path taken is <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

6. The solution to this maze is the path mentioned above, traversing from the origin to the target through the specified coordinates.

7. This path ensures reaching the target (3,3) from the starting point (0,0) by following the connections provided in the adjacency list, reaching the destination in the minimum steps possible.
