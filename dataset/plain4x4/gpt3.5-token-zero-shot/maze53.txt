Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can move to (1,0) and then to (1,1). From there, we move to (1,2) and (1,3) which is the first possible route to the target at (3,3). The path would be <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This is the simplest and most direct path to the target.

Alternatively, we could have also taken a longer path by moving from (1,1) to (2,1), then to (2,2) and finally to (3,2) and (3,3). The path would be <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. However, this path is longer and not the optimal route in this maze.

In conclusion, the optimal path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) is <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
