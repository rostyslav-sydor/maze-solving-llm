1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze by following the adjacency list connections.

2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3).

3. We have reached the target (3,3) successfully.

4. Output the solution path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

5. The solution path traverses through the maze following the provided adjacency list connections and reaches the target point (3,3).

6. The maze was successfully navigated from the origin to the target point by following the specified path in the adjacency list.
