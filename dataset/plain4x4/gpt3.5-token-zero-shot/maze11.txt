1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the graph using a pathfinding algorithm like Dijkstra's or A*.
2. Follow the edges in the graph to navigate through the maze towards the target point (3,3).
3. Keep track of the path taken from the origin to the target.
4. Once the target point is reached, output the path taken in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
5. The solution path could be something like <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
6. Make sure to avoid revisiting already visited nodes and to choose paths that move closer to the target point.
7. Continuing this process will lead to finding the optimal path through the maze from the origin to the target.
