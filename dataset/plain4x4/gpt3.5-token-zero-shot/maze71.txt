First, we can start at the origin point (0,0). By following the adjacency list, we can move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally to (0,3). 
From (0,3) we can move to (1,3) and then to (2,3) following the path.
Next, we can move from (2,3) to (3,3) and reach the target point at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
