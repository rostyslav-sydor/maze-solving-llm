1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze by following the paths listed in the adjacency list.

2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (2,0), and finally to (2,1) to reach the target point (3,3).

3. The path can be represented as: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

4. The solution is to follow the coordinates mentioned in the path from the origin to the target, avoiding any loops or dead ends.

5. By following this path, the maze can be successfully navigated from the origin to the target point in the shortest possible way.
