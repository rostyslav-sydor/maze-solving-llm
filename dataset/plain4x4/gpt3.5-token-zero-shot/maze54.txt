First, we start at coordinate (0,0) as indicated by the <ORIGIN_START> token. We can move to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), and finally reach the target at (3,3) as indicated by the <TARGET_START> token.

So, the path solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path takes us through the maze from the origin to the target, following the connections given in the maze's adjacency list.
