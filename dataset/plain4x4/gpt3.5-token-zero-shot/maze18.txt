First, we need to analyze the maze and find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). One possible solution is to use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm, to find the path with the minimum number of steps.

Starting from the origin, we can follow the adjacency list to explore all possible paths until we reach the target. By keeping track of the visited nodes and updating the shortest path as we go along, we can find the optimal route.

Once the algorithm reaches the target (3,3), we can backtrack from the target to the origin to reconstruct the path taken. The final output should be the list of coordinates representing the path from the origin to the target surrounded by <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

By following this approach, we can navigate through the maze efficiently and find the shortest path to reach the target.
