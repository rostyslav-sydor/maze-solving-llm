To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Starting from the origin point (0,0), we explore the maze by visiting adjacent nodes based on the adjacency list provided. We continue exploring until we reach the target point (3,3).

Following the provided adjacency list, we can create a path by moving from one coordinate to another based on the connections specified in the list. This will guide us through the maze and help us reach the target point.

By applying these steps and following the connections specified in the adjacency list, we can find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). The path can be represented between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens as a list of coordinates indicating the route taken to navigate through the maze and reach the target point.
