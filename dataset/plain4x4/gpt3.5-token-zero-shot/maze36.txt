To solve the maze, we can use an algorithm like Depth First Search or Breadth First Search. Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can explore the maze by visiting adjacent cells based on the adjacency list provided until we reach the target at (3,3).

Following the adjacency list, we can traverse the maze in the following path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we can successfully navigate the maze from the origin to the target.
