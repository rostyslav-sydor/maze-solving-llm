1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0), then (2,0), then (3,0).
3. Move to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3).
4. Reached the target at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path follows the adjacency list provided and navigates from the origin to the target, marking the coordinates passed along the way.
