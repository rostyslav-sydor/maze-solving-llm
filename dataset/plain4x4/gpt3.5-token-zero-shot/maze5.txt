To solve this maze, we can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from the origin point at (0,0), we can explore all possible paths until we reach the target point at (3,3). We need to keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops and choose the correct path.

Starting at (0,0), we can move to (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1). Following the path, we reach (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), and finally (3,3), our target point. 

Therefore, the solution path can be represented as: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point using DFS algorithm.
