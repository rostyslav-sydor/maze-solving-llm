The solution to the maze involves moving from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) while following the adjacency list provided. 

We can start at (0,0) and move through the maze using the given connections until we reach (3,3). 

One possible path could be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

We can format this path as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following the connections provided in the adjacency list, we successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the maze.
