First, we need to identify the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by following the adjacency list provided. The path would be: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the output in the format requested would be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path ensures that we can move from the origin to the target without hitting any walls or obstacles. By following the connections in the adjacency list, we can traverse the maze successfully.
