First, we need to follow the adjacency list to navigate through the maze. Starting at (0,0) <ORIGIN_START>, we can move through the maze by following the connections listed in the adjacency list.

To reach the target at (3,3) <TARGET_START>, we need to move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0) to (3,1) to (3,2) and finally to (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Following this path will lead us from the starting point to the target point, successfully navigating through the maze.
