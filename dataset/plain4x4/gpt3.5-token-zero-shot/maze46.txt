First, we need to identify the possible paths from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. We can start at (0,0) and explore the paths by following the connections specified in the adjacency list.

One possible path could be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path follows the connections in the adjacency list and leads us from the entry point to the exit point. Each coordinate in the path is listed in the required format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
