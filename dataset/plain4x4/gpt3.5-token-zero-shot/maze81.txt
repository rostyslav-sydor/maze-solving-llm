First, we need to analyze the maze starting from the origin point (0,0) and explore the possible paths to reach the target point (3,3). 

The possible paths can be determined by following the adjacency list provided. We can move from one cell to another cell if they are connected in the adjacency list. 

One possible solution path could be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the output path in the requested format would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

By following this path, we can successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point.
