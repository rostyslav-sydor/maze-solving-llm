1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze using the given adjacency list.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3).
3. Once you reach the target point (3,3), backtrack your steps to find the shortest path.
4. Follow the path from (3,3) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (2,0) to (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (0,3) to (0,2) to (0,1) to (0,0).
5. The final path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) <PATH_END>.
6. This path covers all the cells from the origin to the target point, following the connections given in the adjacency list.
