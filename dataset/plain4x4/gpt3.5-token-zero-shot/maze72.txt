First, identify the starting point at (0,0) and the ending point at (3,3). Following the adjacency list, we can start at (0,0) and move to (0,1), then to (1,1), and continue following the connections until we reach (3,3). The path would be (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following the connections in the adjacency list, we successfully navigated from the starting point to the ending point.
