To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) by traversing through the adjacency list provided. By following the connections between the coordinates, we can navigate through the maze.

Starting at (0,0), we can move to (1,0) and then to (1,1). From there, we can go to (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By carefully following the connections in the adjacency list, we successfully navigated through the maze to reach the target.
