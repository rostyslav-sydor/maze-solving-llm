First, we need to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) in the maze. By examining the adjacency list, we can see that there are several possible paths to take. 

One possible path to take is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the solution to this maze is represented by the path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (1,0) (1,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path takes us from the starting point to the target point while following the connections in the adjacency list.
