First, we start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the adjacent points based on the adjacency list provided. We move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) and finally reach the target point at (3,3). The path found is (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
