To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth First Search or Breadth First Search. Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can explore all possible paths until we reach the target at (3,3).

One possible solution is as follows:
1. Start at (0,0) and move to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).
2. Hence, the path from origin to target is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path successfully navigates through the maze using the adjacency list provided. By following the specified connections between nodes, we were able to find a path from the origin to the target.
