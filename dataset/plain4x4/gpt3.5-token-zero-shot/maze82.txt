First, we need to follow the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) in the given adjacency list. 

Starting from (0,0), we can move to (0,1), then to (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), and finally reach the exit point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is from (0,0) to (3,3) and can be represented as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Following this path will successfully lead from the entry to the exit of the maze.
