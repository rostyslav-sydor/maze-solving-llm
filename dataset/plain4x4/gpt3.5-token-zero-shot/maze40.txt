The solution to this maze is as follows:
Start at (0,0) and move to (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).

The path can be represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) by following the adjacency list provided. Each coordinate in the path corresponds to a move from one point to another in the maze, eventually reaching the target point.
