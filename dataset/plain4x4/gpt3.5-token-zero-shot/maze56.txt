First, we need to identify a path through the maze from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3). 

Starting from the origin, we can move to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) and then to (1,3). From there, we can move to (1,2) and (1,1) before reaching (2,1). We then move to (3,1) and finally to the target at (3,3).

Thus, the solution path is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze based on the provided adjacency list of connections between coordinates.
