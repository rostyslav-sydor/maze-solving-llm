1. Start at the origin point (0,0)
2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (2,0), and finally to (3,0)
3. Move from (3,0) to (3,1) and then to (3,2)
4. Move from (3,2) to (3,3) which is the target point
5. The solution path is (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
6. Output the solution path as <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
7. This is the optimal path to navigate through the maze from the origin to the target

By following these steps, we have successfully found the solution path for the given maze.
