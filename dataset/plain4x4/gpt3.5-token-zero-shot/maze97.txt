1. Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1) then to (1,1) to reach (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (2,0) then to (3,0) to reach (3,1).
3. Next, move from (3,1) to (3,2) to reach (3,3).
4. Finally, from (3,3) we have reached the target (3,3).

So, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path follows the connections defined in the maze's adjacency list to navigate from the starting point to the target point.
