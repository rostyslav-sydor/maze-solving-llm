1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore possible paths using the provided adjacency list.
2. Move to (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), and finally reach the target at (3,3).
3. We have successfully found a path from origin to target which is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
4. The path takes us through the maze in a sequence of coordinates leading from the origin to the target.
5. By following the provided connections between nodes in the adjacency list, we were able to navigate the maze successfully.
