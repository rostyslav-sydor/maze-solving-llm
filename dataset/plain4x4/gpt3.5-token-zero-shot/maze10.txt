First, we need to analyze the adjacency list to identify the connections between nodes. We can see that there are connections between various coordinates in the maze. 

Starting at (0,0), we can follow the connections to navigate through the maze towards the target at (3,3). By following the connections, we can create a path from (0,0) to (3,3). The path would be as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path takes us through the maze following the connections provided in the adjacency list, leading us from the origin to the target. By understanding the relationships between the coordinates in the maze, we can successfully navigate our way through it without relying on external codes or tools.
