1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore neighboring cells following the adjacency list until reaching the target (3,3).

2. From (0,0), move to (0,1), then to (0,2), and finally to (0,3) towards the target direction.

3. At (0,3), move vertically down to (1,3), then left to (1,2), and finally up to (2,2).

4. From (2,2), move right to (3,2) and then down to (3,3) to reach the target.

5. The solution path is from (0,0) to (0,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3).

6. Output the path as: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following these steps, the solution path for the maze represented by the given adjacency list can be found and output in the specified format.
