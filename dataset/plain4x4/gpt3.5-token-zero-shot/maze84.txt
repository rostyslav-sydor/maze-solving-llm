First, let's start at the entry point (0,0) and explore the maze using the adjacency list provided. We can follow the path from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3).

We have reached the exit point (3,3) successfully. Therefore, the path from entry to exit is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the optimal path through the maze while following the adjacency list provided. By following each step in the adjacency list, we were able to navigate from the entry point to the exit point successfully.
