First, we need to understand the maze. The adjacency list tells us how each cell is connected to its neighboring cells. 
Starting from (0,0), we can follow the paths based on the adjacency list to reach the target at (3,3). 
We can move cell by cell, making sure to visit each connected cell before moving to the next one. 
By following the connections provided in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze. 
We need to keep track of the cells we have visited to avoid going in circles. 
Once we reach the target at (3,3), we can output the path we followed as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. 
This approach allows us to systematically solve the maze and find the path from the starting point to the target point.
