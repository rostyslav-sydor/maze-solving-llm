First, we need to find a path from the starting point at (0,0) to the target point at (3,3) in the maze provided. We can do this by following the connections given in the adjacency list.

Starting at (0,0), we can move to (0,1) and then to (1,1). From there, we can move to (1,2) and then to (1,3). Moving on, we can reach (2,3), then (3,3) which is our target point.

Therefore, the solution path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path ensures that we have successfully navigated through the maze from the starting point to the target point, following the connections provided in the adjacency list.
