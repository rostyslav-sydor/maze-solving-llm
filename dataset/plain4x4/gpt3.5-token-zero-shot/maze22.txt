First, analyze the maze by following the adjacency list provided and identifying the path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). 

From (0,0), move to (0,1), then to (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) to reach the target point. 

Thus, the solution path for this maze can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following the path in this manner, we can successfully navigate through the maze from the starting point to the target point.
