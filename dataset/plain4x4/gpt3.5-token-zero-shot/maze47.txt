To solve this maze, we can use depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithms. Starting from the entry point (0,0), we can explore the maze by visiting neighboring cells based on the adjacency list provided. We continue this process until we reach the target point (3,3).

By following a path through the maze, we can record the coordinates of each cell visited. Once we reach the target point, we have found a solution to the maze.

So, the output in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens would look something like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents the path taken through the maze from the entry point to the target point.
