Starting from the origin point (0,0), we can move right to (0,1), then down to (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), and finally reach the target point (3,3). The path can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. By following these coordinates, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point. It is important to follow the connections specified in the adjacency list to ensure we take the correct steps at each junction. The path end point is the target (3,3), indicating we have reached the goal of solving the maze.
