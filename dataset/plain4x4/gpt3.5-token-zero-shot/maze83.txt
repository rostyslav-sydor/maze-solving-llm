First, we need to start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze using the provided adjacency list. We can move between connected coordinates by following the paths indicated in the list. 

By following the paths, we can navigate through the maze and eventually reach the target point (3,3). We need to carefully follow each connection to make sure we don't get stuck in a loop or make a wrong turn. 

After successfully navigating through the maze, we can output the solution in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, showing the path taken from the origin to the target. This will provide a clear visual representation of the successful solution to the maze. 

By following these steps methodically, we can efficiently solve the maze and present the solution in a clear and concise manner.
