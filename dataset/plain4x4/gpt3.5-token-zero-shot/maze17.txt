First, we need to navigate through the maze using the adjacency list provided. Starting from (0,0), we can move to (1,0) and then to (2,0) to reach (3,0). From there, we can move to (3,1) and further to (3,2) and finally reach the target at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path would be: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following the connections provided in the adjacency list, we were able to successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target. This path avoids any obstacles or dead ends, providing a clear route to the destination.
