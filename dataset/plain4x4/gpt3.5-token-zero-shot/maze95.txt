First, we need to start from the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze using the adjacency list provided. We can follow the connections between each node until we reach the target point (3,3).

Checking the adjacency list, we can see that the possible paths to take are:
- (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the path from the origin to the target can be represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we can successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target.
