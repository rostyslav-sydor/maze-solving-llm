First, we need to identify a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) in the maze. We can follow the adjacency list provided to navigate through the maze, moving from one cell to another.

Starting from (0,0), we can move to (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target point at (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the starting point to the target point in the maze.
