To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm starting from the entrance point at (0,0) and exploring all possible paths until reaching the exit point at (3,3). 
We can keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting the same location. 
The solution path will be the sequence of coordinates that lead from the entrance to the exit. 
After exploring all possible paths, we can output the solution path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. 
By following this approach, we can navigate through the maze and find the optimal path from the entrance to the exit efficiently.
