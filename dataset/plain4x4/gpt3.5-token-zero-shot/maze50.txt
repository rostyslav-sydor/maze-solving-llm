First, we need to start from the entry point (0,0) and explore the maze using the given adjacency list. From (0,0), we can move to (1,0), and then to (1,1), and finally to (2,1) where we reach the exit point (3,3). The path can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This path follows the connections provided in the adjacency list and reaches the target point.

By carefully analyzing the connections between nodes in the maze, we can find the optimal path from the entry point to the exit point. Following the connections in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze efficiently and reach the target point.

In summary, the solution to the maze is <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>, following the connections provided in the adjacency list.
