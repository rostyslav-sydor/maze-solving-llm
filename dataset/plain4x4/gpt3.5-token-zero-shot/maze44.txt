First, let's identify the entry point at (0,0) and the exit point at (3,3). From the given adjacency list, we can see that we can move from one coordinate to another through the specified connections. By following the connections, we can navigate through the maze to reach the exit point at (3,3) from the entry point at (0,0).

One possible solution path is: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the output in the requested format would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the entry point to the exit point in the maze.
