First, we can start at the origin point (0,0). Following the adjacency list, we can make our way through the maze by moving from one point to the next. 

We can move from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally to the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following the connections specified in the adjacency list, we successfully navigated the maze from the origin to the target point.
