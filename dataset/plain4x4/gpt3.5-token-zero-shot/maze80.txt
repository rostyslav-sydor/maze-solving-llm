First, we need to analyze the maze and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 
Starting at (0,0), we can move to (1,0), then to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), and finally reach (2,3).
From (2,3), we can move to (3,3) to reach the target.
Therefore, the solution path is (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).
The output path in the required format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This represents the coordinates to follow to successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the maze.
