To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as depth-first search or breadth-first search. Starting from the origin at (0,0), we can explore the maze by following the paths in the adjacency list until we reach the target at (3,3).

By traversing the maze using a graph traversal algorithm, we can find the path that leads from the origin to the target. Once the target is reached, we can backtrack the path taken and output it in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

The solution path for this maze might look like: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path represents the steps taken from the origin to the target in the maze. By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the starting point to the destination point in the maze.
