To solve this maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm starting from the entry point at (0,0) and navigating through the adjacency list until reaching the exit point at (3,3). The algorithm should prioritize exploring unvisited neighbors before backtracking.

By following this approach, we can traverse the maze efficiently and find a path from the entry to the exit point. The final path found may include coordinates such as (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3).

This path can be represented between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens in the format (row, column) to clearly indicate the sequence of moves made to reach the destination. This output format will provide a clear visualization of the solution path through the maze.
