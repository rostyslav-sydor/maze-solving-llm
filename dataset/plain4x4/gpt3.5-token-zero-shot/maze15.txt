To solve this maze, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Starting from the origin point (0,0), we explore all possible paths until we reach the target point (3,3).

Following the given adjacency list, we can move from one node to another based on the connections listed. We can keep track of visited nodes to avoid going in circles.

One possible path solution for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the origin point (0,0), follows the connections in the adjacency list, and reaches the target point (3,3).

By following the steps outlined above and exploring all possible paths, we can successfully find a solution to the maze represented in the given adjacency list format.
