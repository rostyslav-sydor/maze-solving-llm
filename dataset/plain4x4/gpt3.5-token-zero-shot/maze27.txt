1. Start at (0,0) as indicated by <ORIGIN_START> token.
2. Move to (1,0) as per the adjacency list.
3. Go to (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), and finally reach (3,3) as indicated by <TARGET_START> token.
4. The path can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
5. The solution completes the maze successfully.

By following the adjacency list provided and moving from one node to another, we were able to find a path from the origin to the target in the maze. This solution demonstrates the importance of carefully planning each move to navigate through the maze effectively.
