First, we need to start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze based on the given adjacency list. We will follow the paths specified in the list until we reach the target point (3,3).

Following the paths specified in the adjacency list, we can move through the maze as follows: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Thus, the solution path for this maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

This path takes us from the origin to the target point by following the specified connections between the cells in the maze. By carefully tracking our movements based on the adjacency list, we successfully navigate through the maze to reach the exit point.
