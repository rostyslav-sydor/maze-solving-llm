First, we need to identify the path from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (3,3). We can start at (0,0) and follow the adjacency list connections to navigate through the maze.

Following the path, we move from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), and finally reach the exit at (3,3). Therefore, the solution for this maze is the path <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By traversing the maze graph based on the given adjacency list connections, we were able to reach the exit point efficiently. This path represents the route from the entry to the exit with the least number of moves, successfully solving the maze.
