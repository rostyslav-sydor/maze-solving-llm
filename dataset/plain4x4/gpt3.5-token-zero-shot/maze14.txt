First, we need to navigate through the maze from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). By following the given adjacency list, we can see the possible paths to take at each intersection. 

Starting at (0,0), we move to (1,0), then to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) and finally reach the target point (3,3). 

Therefore, the solution path is as follows: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>. 

This path allows us to navigate through the maze efficiently and reach the target point successfully.
