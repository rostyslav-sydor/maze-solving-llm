1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2).
3. Move to (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) to reach the target point.
4. The path taken in coordinates: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
5. Remember to follow the connections provided in the adjacency list to navigate through the maze efficiently.
6. Take note of the directions and ensure you are moving towards the target point.
7. By following this path, you successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the maze.
