First, we need to start from the entry point at (0,0) and explore the maze using the given adjacency list. We can move from one node to another if they are connected in the adjacency list. 

By following the connections in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze towards the exit point at (3,3). 

Tracing the path manually, it seems the path should be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

So, the solution for this maze would be represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, one can successfully navigate from the entry point to the exit point in the maze.
