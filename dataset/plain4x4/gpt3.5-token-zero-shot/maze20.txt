To navigate through the maze, we can start at the origin point (0,0) and move through the adjacency list to reach the target point (3,3). Following the connections in the adjacency list, we make the following path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). Therefore, the solution path can be represented as <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>. This path moves through the maze, following the connections between the nodes specified in the adjacency list until it reaches the target point.
