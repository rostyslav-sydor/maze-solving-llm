First, we need to identify the possible paths from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided. We can start at (0,0) and follow the connections in the list to move towards the target.

Following the connections in the list, a possible path could be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Using this path, we successfully reach the target (3,3) from the origin (0,0).

Therefore, the output in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
