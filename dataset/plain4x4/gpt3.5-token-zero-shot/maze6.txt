To solve the maze, we can start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the neighboring cells based on the adjacency list provided. By following the connections between cells, we can navigate towards the target point (3,3). One possible solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we move from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (1,2) to (2,2) to (3,2) and finally to the target point (3,3). By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target.

By iterating through the adjacency list and connecting the cells based on the provided connections, we can find a valid path from the origin to the target within the maze.
