First, we can start at the origin point (0,0). Then, we move from (0,0) to (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), and finally reach the target point at (3,3). This path ensures that we follow the edges specified in the adjacency list.

Therefore, the solution for this maze is as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we successfully navigate through the maze from the origin point to the target point while respecting the connections specified in the adjacency list.
