First, we need to analyze the adjacency list provided to find a path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3). By examining the connections, we can see that the following path is a solution: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). 

Now, let's represent this path in the requested format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the origin to the target in the maze provided in the adjacency list. Each pair of coordinates represents moving either horizontally or vertically between neighboring cells until reaching the destination.
