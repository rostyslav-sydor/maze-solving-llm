1. Start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze by following the adjacency list connections.
2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) - reaching the target point at (3,3).
3. Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
4. By following this path, the maze can be successfully navigated from the origin to the target point.
