1. Start at the origin point (0,0)
2. Move to (1,0) 
3. Move to (1,1)
4. Move to (1,2)
5. Move to (1,3)
6. Move to (2,3)
7. Move to (3,3) and reach the target point

Therefore, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows the adjacency list connections provided in the maze description to reach the target point (3,3) from the origin point (0,0) in the maze.
