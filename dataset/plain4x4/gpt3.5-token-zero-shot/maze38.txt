First, we can start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the graph using a depth-first search algorithm to find a path to the target point (3,3). We can keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops and backtrack when necessary.

Following the adjacency list provided, we can explore the graph by visiting neighboring nodes in a systematic manner. Once we reach the target point (3,3), we can backtrack our steps to reconstruct the path taken.

The solution path would look something like this:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following this path, we can successfully navigate from the origin to the target point in the maze.
