1. Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze using the adjacency list provided.
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) following the path listed in the adjacency list.
3. Once you reach the target (3,3), mark the path taken.
4. The solution to this maze would be the path from (0,0) to (3,3) as follows: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
5. This path represents the steps taken to navigate through the maze from the origin to the target.

By following these steps and tracing the path taken using the adjacency list provided, we were able to find the solution to this maze.
