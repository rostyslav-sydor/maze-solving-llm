To solve the maze, we can start at the origin point (0,0) and navigate through the maze using the adjacency list provided. We can move from one cell to another if they are connected in the adjacency list.

Following the connections in the adjacency list, we can navigate from (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) and reach the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
