First, we need to follow the adjacency list to navigate through the maze. Starting at (0,0), we can move through the maze by following the connections provided in the adjacency list. By doing so, we can reach the target point at (3,3). The path we take can be represented as a series of coordinates, which we can output between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To find the solution to the maze, we can start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze by following the connections in the adjacency list until we reach the target point (3,3). We can keep track of our path as we move through the maze, and output the coordinates of the path between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

By following the connections in the adjacency list, we can navigate through the maze efficiently and reach the target point successfully. The final path can be represented by a series of coordinates between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
