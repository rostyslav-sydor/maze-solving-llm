First, we start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze according to the adjacency list provided. Following the connections, we navigate through the maze until we reach the target point (3,3). The path we take is as follows: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path through the maze is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path avoids any loops or dead ends and successfully reaches the target point (3,3) from the origin point (0,0).
