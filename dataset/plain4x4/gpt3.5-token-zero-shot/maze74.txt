First, we need to start at the origin point (0,0) and explore the maze using the given adjacency list. We will move from one coordinate to another based on the connections provided in the list.

Following the connections, we can move from (0,0) to (1,0), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target point at (3,3). This path will lead us to the exit of the maze.

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following these coordinates in the given order, we can successfully navigate through the maze from the origin to the target point.
