First, we need to start at the origin point (0,0) and move through the maze based on the adjacency list provided. We can follow the connections from one point to another until we reach the target point (3,3).

By following the connections in the adjacency list, we can determine the path that leads from the origin to the target. The path will likely include multiple turns and moves in different directions to navigate through the maze.

Once we have determined the path from the origin to the target, we can output it in the requested format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. This will show the series of coordinates that must be followed to successfully navigate through the maze and reach the target point.

By carefully analyzing the connections and making strategic moves, we can find the optimal path through the maze and present it in the requested format.
