First, we need to explore the maze using the adjacency list provided. We start at coordinates (0,0) and follow the paths given until we reach the target at (3,3).

We can start at (0,0) and move to (0,1), then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach the target at (3,3). 

Therefore, the solution path for this maze would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Following this path will lead us from the origin to the target, navigating through the maze successfully.
