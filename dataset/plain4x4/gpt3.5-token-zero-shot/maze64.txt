1. Start at the origin (0,0) and move to (1,0).
2. Move from (1,0) to (1,1) and then to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), move to (0,2) and then to (0,3).
4. Go from (0,3) to (1,3) and then to (2,3).
5. Move from (2,3) to (3,3) to reach the target.

So, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path covers all the necessary steps to navigate from the origin to the target in the maze.
