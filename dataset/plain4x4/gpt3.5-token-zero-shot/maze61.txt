First, we need to identify the starting point at (0,0) and the ending point at (3,3) in the maze. From the adjacency list, we can see that we need to move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (3,1) and finally to (3,2) and (3,3) to reach the target.

Thus, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>.

Following this path through the maze will lead us from the starting point to the ending point and successfully navigate the maze. By following the adjacency list and moving according to the connections between points, we can reach our destination efficiently.
