The maze requires navigating from the start (S) located at (1,1) to the end (E) at (7,7). This can be done by analyzing the maze structure manually for clear paths, avoiding encountered walls (`#`).

Begin at (1,1) and move right to (1,3). At this point, move down navigating open spaces until reaching (3,3). Proceed down and then left to (3,1). Go straight down, bypassing the vertical wall from (5,1) to (7,1). Now, shift right to (7,2) and continue moving to the right until reaching the exit at (7,7).

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,2) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path was computed by planning movements through open spaces that navigate towards the overall direction of the end point while avoiding walls and dead-ends noted during the manual analysis of the maze layout. Each coordinate step is feasible since it moves either horizontally or vertically to an adjacent open cell.
