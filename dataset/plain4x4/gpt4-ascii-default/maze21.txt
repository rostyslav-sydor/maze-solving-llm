To solve the maze, we can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm starting from the entry point (1,1), exploring adjacent cells that are open (not walls '#') while avoiding visiting the same cell twice. When we reach the exit (7,7), we backtrack, documenting the path taken.

<PATH_START> 
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)
<PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Start at (1,1), and move right until blocked by a wall at (1,8).
2. Move downwards to (2,7) and then to (3,7).
3. Continue to move downwards facing no obstruction until reaching (7,7).
4. Navigate minor detours around interior walls noted by backtracking minimally to find open pathways. 

This method ensures a comprehensive traversal of every potentially accessible path until the exit is located, guaranteeing a successful solution path as long as one exists.
