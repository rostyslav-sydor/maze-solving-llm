To solve the maze, we start from the entry point 'S' located at (1,1) and look for available paths that avoid walls (#) to reach the exit point 'E' located at (7,7). We traverse the maze employing a pathfinding strategy like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which finds the shortest path.

1. Starting at (1,1), we move right to (1,2) and (1,3) since there are no obstacles.
2. We continue moving right to (1,4) and (1,5).
3. At (1,6), we can move further right to (1,7).
4. From (1,7), next is a downward movement to (2,7).
5. As moving right leads to a wall, we proceed down further to (3,7), (4,7).
6. At (4,7), we take another downward path to (5,7).
7. From (5,7), we proceed to explore right to (5,8) and observe an open path down to (6,8).
8. Similarly, move further down to (7,8) and finally move left to the exit point at (7,7).

The path through the maze can then be summarized and formatted accordingly:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) (7,7) <PATH_END>
