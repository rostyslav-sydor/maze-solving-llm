To solve the maze, we'll use a strategy that involves manually exploring paths from the starting point (S) at coordinate (1,1) until we reach the endpoint (E) at coordinate (7,7). The process involves moving through open spaces (' ') while avoiding walls ('#'). Here is one possible path from S to E:

1. Start at (1,1), go right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) in clear path until meeting a wall at (1,7).
2. Move down to (2,6), go left to (2,5), then continue moving down through (3,5), and (4,5).
3. Turn right through (4,6), (4,7), then down to (5,7), go left to (5,6), and then down through (6,6) to (7,6).
4. Shift right to the endpoint (7,7).

This path is viable as it moves from the starting point to the endpoint, avoiding walls entirely.
