To solve the maze, we must start from S (1,1) and reach E (7,7).

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Starting from the entry point S at (1,1), the path moves right across the open row until (1,5).
2. The path then descends to (2,5) and continues down to (3,5) where it is possible to move right till the end of that row at (3,7).
3. From (3,7), the path descends to (4,7) and then to (5,7), from where it moves left to (5,5).
4. From (5,5), the path descends to (6,5), continuing down and moving right to reach the exit E at (7,7).

This path navigates the open pathways of the maze avoiding walls and backtracking, ensuring to progress towards the direction of the exit.
