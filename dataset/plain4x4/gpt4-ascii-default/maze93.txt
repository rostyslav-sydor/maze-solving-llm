<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To find the solution:
1. Start at the entry point (1,1).
2. Move horizontally to the right until reaching the wall at (1,6).
3. Move vertically down to the hallway leading to the exit area (avoiding dead ends, which would require turning back) following through positions (2,5) to (6,5).
4. Continue vertically to reach the wall at (7,5).
5. Move horizontally to the right, finally reaching the exit at (7,7).

This path avoids all walls and dead ends, providing an effective route from the start point 'S' to the exit 'E'.
