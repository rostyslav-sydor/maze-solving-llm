To solve the maze, we start at the entrance (S at (1,1)), and look for a path that leads to the exit (E at (7,7)) without crossing any walls (#). The viable path, considering the maze layout and wall placements, proceeds as follows:

1. Starting at (1,1), move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6).
2. Move down to (2,6).
3. Move right to (2,7).
4. Move down to (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).
5. Move left to (5,6).
6. Move down to (6,6).
7. Continue moving down to (7,6).
8. Move right to reach the exit at (7,7).

This route navigates through open pathways, avoids walls, and utilizes available corridors to connect the start and end points efficiently. Ensure each step moves only into open cells (' ') that directly connect horizontally or vertically, thereby following a straightforward path towards the exit.
