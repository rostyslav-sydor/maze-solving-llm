To solve the maze, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) method to explore all possible paths from the start to the end. We start at the initial position 'S' (1,1) and move to adjacent non-wall cells (' ') while avoiding revisiting cells to prevent loops.

1. Starting at 'S' (1,1), we move right (east), the only possible direction without encountering walls.
2. We continue moving right until we reach (1,7). At this point, moving further right would crash into a wall.
3. We then move down (south) to (2,7). Continuing to move down leads us to a wall.
4. We take the next available step down to (3,7) and continue this pattern, bypassing walls when needed.
5. At each juncture where movement in the target direction is blocked by a wall, we probe right, down, left, up sequentially to see if those paths are open, then proceed.
6. Once we're at (7,7), we reach the ending position 'E'.

Following this path, we traverse from 'S' to 'E' smoothly using open passage cells. The successful path from 'S' to 'E' is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
