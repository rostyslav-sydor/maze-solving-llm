To solve this ASCII maze, I will perform a depth-first search (DFS) from the starting point (S) at (1,1) to the endpoint (E) at (7,7). This strategy involves exploring each direction from a cell unless blocked by a wall ('#') or revisiting cells already included in the current path, hence using backtracking when needed.

Starting from (1,1), I will explore right and downward paths since these are the allowed movements in mazes typically.

Here's the solution path obtained by tracing through the maze:
1. Move right from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (1,7).
2. Move down from (1,7) to (2,7).
3. Move left from (2,7) to (2,6) to keep far from wall but then down through (3,6) to (4,6).
4. Move straight down through (5,6).
5. Move left from (5,6) to (5,5) then down from (5,5) to (6,5) to (7,5).
6. Move right from (7,5) to (7,6) and then finally arrive at (7,7).

The path coordinates tracked in order:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
