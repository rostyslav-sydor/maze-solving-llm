To solve the maze, one can employ classical methods, such as the Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, providing eloquent insight without code, I will briefly describe the BFS approach for clarity:

1. **Initialization**: Start at `S`, coordinates (1,1). Enqueue this position.
2. **Exploration**:
    - Dequeue the position and check valid adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) ignoring walls.
    - For each valid move, mark the cell as visited to prevent revisiting and enqueue the new cell position.
3. **Goal Check**: Each step checks if the current cell is the exit `E`. If it is, traceback from that position to `S` to reconstruct the path.
4. **Traceback to Construct Path**: Each cell will keep track of where it came from to allow reconstruction of the path from the exit `E` back to the entry `S` once the goal is reached.

Using BFS, which explores layer by layer, ensures the shortest path in an unweighted maze like this.

Following this strategy, the BFS approach would yield this path found:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path effectively moves horizontally at first opportunity, leverages the horizontal corridor, and completes the vertical movements to the exit.
