To solve the maze, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores the maze level by level reaching the shortest path from start (S) to end (E).

Starting from S at (1,1), we'll move through the available paths (open spaces indicated by empty spaces next to each coordinate while avoiding walls ('#')). Steps include traversing left, right, up, and down unless there is a boundary or a wall.

Following this systematic method, here's a valid solution for the given maze:

- Start at S (1,1).
- Move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).
- Move down to (2,4).
- Move left to (2,3), (2,2).
- Move down to (3,2).
- Move right to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).
- Move down to (4,5).
- Move right to (5,5), (5,6).
- Move down to (5,7), (6,7).
- Move down to E at (7,7).

Given solution path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path moves through passages that are open and does not cross any walls, ensuring an optimal and correct path from start to end.
