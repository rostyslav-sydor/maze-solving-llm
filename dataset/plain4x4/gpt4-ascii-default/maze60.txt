To solve this maze, we start at the entrance (S) at (1,1) and search for a path to the exit (E) at (7,7). Using a path-finding technique such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), we traverse the maze, exploring all possible routes. In the maze grid, spaces represent passable areas, and hashes (#) are walls which are impassable. 

Here's the solution:

- Begin at the starting point (1,1).
- Move right continuously till (1,4) as it's an open path.
- At (1,4), move down to (2,4).
- At (2,4), move right to (2,7).
- At (2,7), move down to (4,7).
- At (4,7), cannot move down due to wall, move left to (4,4).
- At (4,4), again move down to (6,4).
- At (6,4), move left to (6,3) and right after to (6,7).
- Finally, from (6,7), move down to (7,7), the exit.

With each movement, ensure it doesn’t intersect with walls and doesn't backtrack to previously visited paths.

Here’s how the path would be represented:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (4,6) (4,5) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,3) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
