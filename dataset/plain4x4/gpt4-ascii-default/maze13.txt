<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

### Reasoning:
1. Start at the initial position (1,1).
2. Move vertically down from (1,1) to (7,1) since this path is free of walls and allows progressing further in the downward direction.
3. Upon reaching (7,1), the only feasible direction without encountering a wall is to proceed horizontally to the right.
4. Move horizontally from (7,1) through to (7,7) where each step (7,2), (7,3), etc., is free of obstacles and leads directly to the exit (7,7) marked by 'E'. 

This path is valid as it doesn't cross any walls and directly connects the 'S' starting point to the 'E' end point following clear available pathways.
