To solve the maze, we start at the initial position (1,1) and find a path to the exit at (7,7). We can only move horizontally or vertically between adjacent squares that are not walls.

Following this strategy:
1. Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7).
2. Move downward from (1,7) to (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), and (5,7).
3. From (5,7), move left to (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) and (5,3).
4. Move down from (5,3) to (6,3) and (7,3).
5. Finally, from (7,3), move right to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and reach the exit at (7,7).

Hence, the path from the start to the exit is: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>. 

This path avoids all walls, and efficiently takes the user from the start to the exit point.
