<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Starting at point S (1,1), we move vertically down as there are no rightward paths available due to walls.
2. We continue to move down until reaching (5,1), which is clear from walls.
3. At (5,1), we start moving to the right through open spaces indicated by the ' ' character until we reach (5,6).
4. From (5,6), the path leads us down to (6,6).
5. Finally, we have to move towards the right from (6,6) to (7,6) and down to (7,7), where E is located, and the maze is exited. 

This route avoids all the walls ("#") and follows a straightforward path from the starting point S to the endpoint E, considering all the available open paths (" ").
