Analyzing this maze, the following path navigates from the start (S) to the exit (E) adhering to the open passages between the walls:

1. Start at S (1,1).
2. Move right to (1,2) and continue moving right until (1,7).
3. At (1,7), move down to (2,7).
4. At (2,7), move right to (2,8).
5. At (2,8), move down to (3,8).
6. At (3,8), keep moving down through open spaces until reaching (7,8).
7. At (7,8), move left to E located at (7,7).

This sequence prioritizes a rightward and downward movement strategy since these directions tend to be less obstructed than moving left or upward in this particular maze configuration. The path is constructed without backtracking, adhering strictly to accessible passageways as defined by spaces not occupied by walls.
