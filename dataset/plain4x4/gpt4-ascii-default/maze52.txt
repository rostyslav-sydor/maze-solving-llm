To solve the maze, we employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which efficiently explores all possible paths from the start 'S' to the exit 'E' by using a queue to handle possible paths and storing visited cells:

1. From the start point (1,1), the traversable directions are towards the right till (1,7).
2. At (1,7), we move downwards to (2,7) and then to (3,7).
3. From (3,7), the available paths are moving left to (3,6) and (3,5).
4. At (3,5), we head downward to (4,5).
5. Move from (4,5) to further downwards up to (6,5).
6. From (6,5) pass through (6,6) and (6,7).
7. Move up from (6,7) to (5,7), then (4,7) and finally to (3,7).
8. Go right from (3,7) to (3,8), then down to (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), and end at exit (7,8).

Indexed at: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

The decision-making at each step is based on available non-wall paths and unvisited cells.
