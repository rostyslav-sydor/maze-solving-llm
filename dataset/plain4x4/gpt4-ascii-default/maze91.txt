To solve the ASCII maze, I visualize a path accessible from S to E, avoiding the walls (`#`), and traverse using a systematic approach such as the breadth-first search or depth-first search algorithm, hypothetically. Using breadth-first search in my reasoning:

1. Start at S(1,1).
2. Move to open adjacent cells (1,2) and (2,1).
3. Continue to traverse avoiding walls:
   - (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4).
4. Move vertically down from (2,1) to (7,1) since all horizontally adjacent cells are walls.
5. From (7,1), move horizontally to (7,7) where 'E' is located, since it's directly accessible without walls intervening.

Path traced: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7).

Hence the solution output would be formatted as:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This solution ensures that only non-wall spaces are traversed and the exit is reached from the entrance.
