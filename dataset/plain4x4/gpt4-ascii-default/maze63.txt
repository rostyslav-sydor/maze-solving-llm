To solve the maze, we'll perform a path-finding algorithm (such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, or A* search) starting from the entry point 'S' at (1,1) and navigating through open spaces (spaces not occupied by '#') to reach the exit 'E' at (7,7).

1. Start at (1,1)
2. Move right across row 1 to (1,7) since it's clear.
3. Move down to (7,7) from (1,7). We need to circumvent the walls placed between these coordinates by diving into rows and horizontally moving when unobstructed.
4. At (1,7) go down to (2,7), which is feasible.
5. Then move into row 3 and proceed straight to (3,7).
6. Keep going downwards touching (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) until reaching (7,7).

Each coordinate step would be checked whether it leads to a wall or an open space, ensuring that only valid paths are followed through the representation.
