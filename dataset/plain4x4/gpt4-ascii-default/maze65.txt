<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start at (1,1), the only available movement is to the right.
2. Continue moving right from (1,2) to (1,7) because the cells directly downwards are all blocked by walls.
3. At (1,7), start moving downward. Though there is a wall directly at (2,7), the accessible path begins at (1,8) which is navigable.
4. Continue moving down until reaching (7,7) where the 'E' for 'Exit' is located.
5. The chosen path is straightforward since there is a clear horizontal corridor followed by a direct vertical path to the exit. Each move ensures staying within open space and avoiding walls, leading directly from start to finish.
