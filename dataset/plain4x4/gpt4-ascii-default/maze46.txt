To solve the maze, we move from the starting position (S) to the exit (E) by navigating through open paths (' ') and avoiding walls ('#'). The coordinates are mentioned with the format (row, column), starting from (1,1).

Starting at (1,1):

1. Move right (east) from (1,1) to (1,7) since the direct path is clear.
2. Move down (south) to (7,7). The path is straightforward here until blocked by walls at various points, which forces specific maneuvering:
   - (2,7) directly down to (4,7)
   - However, the wall at (5,7) requires a move left to (5,6), then further south to (7,6), bypassing walls.
   - Finally, move right to (7,7) which is the exit.

Summary Path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Each step avoids walls and follows open paths to the exit, ensuring a valid solution.
