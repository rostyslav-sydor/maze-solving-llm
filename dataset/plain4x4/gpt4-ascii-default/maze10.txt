To solve this maze, we start from the initial point (S) and explore possible paths, avoiding walls (#) and moving towards the end point (E). A successful route finds a path from S to E through open spaces.

1. Start at S at (1,1) and move right to (1,2), continue to (1,3).
2. Move down one step to (2,3), continue moving down to (3,3).
3. Move right to (3,4), continue moving right to (3,7).
4. Move down to (4,7), continue moving down to (7,7) where E is located. 

Adding all these coordinates together and encapsulating them within the appropriate tokens:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This is a direct path from the starting point to the exit without hitting any walls, demonstrating a viable path solving the maze.
