To solve the maze, I will trace a path from the start (S) to the end (E) following a simple strategy to avoid walls (#) and navigate through open spaces. I will use the right-hand rule as a heuristic, trying to keep the right hand on walls to find the egress, ensuring that movement is always possible:

1. Start at the entry-point, S at (1,1).
2. Move right to (1,2), continue moving along the open path.
3. Move continuously to the right towards (1,5). Change direction downwards to (2,5), following open spaces.
4. At (4,5), shift the direction to the left until (4,3). Switch to moving down again.
5. At intersection (7,3), go right until reaching the endpoint E at (7,7).

The resultant sequence avoids walls and adheres to available paths from S to E.

**Output:**
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
