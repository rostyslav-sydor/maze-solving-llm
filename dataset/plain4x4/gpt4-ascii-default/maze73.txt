<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (4,4) (4,3) (4,2) (5,2) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start at (1,1) which is the entry point 'S'.
2. Progress rightwards as far as possible until reaching (1,5), which is the farthest point reachable in a straight line without hitting a wall.
3. Move downwards through column 5, navigating around the internal blocks from (2,5) to (4,5).
4. To bypass the block directly below, move left from (4,5) to (4,2).
5. Head downwards again from (4,2) and make a right turn at (6,2) towards (6,5), navigating around another set of blockages.
6. Finally, move right to (6,6) and down to the exit 'E' at (7,7). This path avoids all walls and efficiently makes use of open spaces.
