<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Explanation:

1. Start at the entry point (1,1).
2. Move right (east) from (1,1) to (1,4) because moving down leads to a wall.
3. Move down (south) from (1,4) to (4,4). Other options, like moving up, are not feasible because of walls or the boundary.
4. Move down (south) to (5,4) since moving directly left or down leads to dead ends.
5. Continue right (east) from (5,4) to (5,7) as the next column at each step doesn't contain walls.
6. Move down (south) finally from (5,7) to (7,7), as no obstacles are present and it directly leads to the exit (E). 

This path directly navigates the maze with turn-by-turn right or down moves avoiding all dead ends and walls, ensuring an efficient exit.
