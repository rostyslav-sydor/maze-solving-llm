To find a solution, start from the entry point (S) and explore each possible direction (up, down, left, right), avoiding walls (#) and backtracking when no further move is possible from a current position (dead-end). This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

Starting from the entry at (1,1): Move right as it’s the only available direction. Continue to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and to (1,7), where further movement to the right is blocked by a wall. Turn down to (2,7) then down again to (3,7). Move left from (3,7) to (3,6) and then to (3,5), noticing a passable path down, so move to (4,5), then down to (5,5), followed by a move to (6,5) and further to (6,6). From (6,6), since movement is constrained by walls, move down to (7,6), which is directly left of the exit (E). Make the final move to the exit at (7,7).

The correct path in order from start (S) to end (E):

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
