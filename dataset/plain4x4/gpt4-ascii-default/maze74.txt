<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Start from the entry point (1,1). 
2. Move horizontally right to the end of the open path until (1,7).
3. Move vertically down two steps to (3,7).
4. To avoid an imminent dead end, back-track left two steps to reach (3,5).
5. From here, move vertically downward until a wall is met at (6,5).
6. Go right to (6,7), drop slightly south to (7,7) to finish at the exit. 

This path efficiently navigates the open corridors, avoiding unnecessary detours or revisits to previously traversed areas.
