Explanation:
1. Start at the entrance represented by 'S' at (1,1).
2. Navigate rightwards to the eastmost boundary of the first corridor since no south paths exist until reaching coordinate (1,7).
3. Move downwards into the second corridor (2,7).
4. Continue down to (3,7). Move left in this corridor until reaching the western opening at (3,5).
5. Head south through the vertical corridor until (7,5). The walls prevent moving south any earlier.
6. After reaching (7,5), the exit at 'E' is a short eastward path away. Move to (7,6) and finally (7,7) to exit the maze.
