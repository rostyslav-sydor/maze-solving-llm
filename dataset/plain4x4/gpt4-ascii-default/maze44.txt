To solve the given maze, we use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method starting from the entry point (S at (1,1)):

1. From (1,1) move right to (1,2) and (1,3). Up and down are blocked by walls.
2. From (1,3) continue moving right to (1,4) (open path).
3. At (1,4), you can move up, down, or right. Moving right leads to a wall at (1,5), and up is blocked by a wall, so move down to (2,4).
4. From (2,4), move down to (3,4).
5. At (3,4), move right to (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7), which are all open.
6. From (3,7), move down to (4,7).
7. From (4,7), you need to continue down to (5,7) and (6,7).
8. Finally, from (6,7) move down to (7,7), reaching the exit (E).

Here is the simplest path from the start (S) to the exit (E) using BFS:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path stays on the available open spaces, moves right until forced to move down, and proceeds straightforwardly to the exit.
