To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (the 'S' at position (1,1)) and navigate through the open passages (spaces), avoiding walls ('#'), to reach the exit (the 'E' at position (7,7)).

The route involves moving right in the first row, taking advantage of openings in the maze walls, moving downward, rightward again and continuing this pattern while avoiding dead ends.

Following the maze's path leads to this solution:

<PATH_START> 
(1,1) 
(1,2) 
(1,3) 
(1,4) 
(1,5) 
(1,6) 
(2,6) 
(3,6) 
(4,6) 
(4,5) 
(4,4) 
(4,3) 
(3,3) 
(2,3) 
(2,2) 
(2,1) 
(3,1) 
(4,1) 
(5,1) 
(5,2) 
(5,3) 
(6,3) 
(6,4) 
(6,5) 
(7,5) 
(7,6) 
(7,7) 
<PATH_END>

This path follows available routes without backtracking or encountering any dead ends, ultimately leading to the end point as effectively as possible.
