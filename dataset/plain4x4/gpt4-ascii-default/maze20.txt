<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning for the above solution:
1. Begin at the starting point (1,1).
2. Move downward as the path along the first column is unobstructed until the bottom of the maze.
3. Then, move to the right when reaching the end of the column, as the path remains clear along the seventh row.
4. Continue right till reaching the exit point at (7,7).

This solution is derived by visually tracking the feasible path directly from the start to the exit using simple `down` and `right` moves. The path provided avoids all walls marked by `#` ensuring uninterrupted traversal from start (S) to end (E).
