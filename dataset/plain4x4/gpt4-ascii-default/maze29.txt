To solve the maze and find a path from the entry (S, at (1,1)) to the exit (E, at (7,7)), we'll trace a route avoiding the walls (#) and adhering to the open paths (spaces).

Starting at (1,1):
1. Move right to (1,2) and (1,3) as it's free.
2. Move down to (2,3) as it's the only possible move.
3. Continue right to (2,4) and then down to (3,4).
4. From (3,4), move right through (3,5) to (3,6).
5. Once at (3,6), move down to (4,6).
6. Continue to move down from (4,6) through open spaces reaching (7,6).
7. Finally, from (7,6) move right to the exit at (7,7).

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path avoids all walls and provides a clear, walkable path from the start to the exit of the maze using right and downward movements.
