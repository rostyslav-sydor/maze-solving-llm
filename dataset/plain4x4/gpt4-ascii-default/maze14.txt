To solve the maze from the start (S) at position (1,1) to the end (E) at (7,7), a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) identifies the shortest path step-by-step, considering the layout and wall restrictions.

Starting at (1,1), the algorithm explores all accessible paths leading to (7,7) while avoiding walls:

1. Move from (1,1) rightwards to open spaces until reaching (1,7).
2. From (1,7), move downward to (2,7) and continue to (3,7).
3. At (3,7), shift left to (3,6), then down to (4,6).
4. Continue from (4,6) to (4,3) by moving left to avoid walls.
5. From (4,3) move downwards to (6,3) passing via (5,3).
6. Now move right from (6,3) to (6,5), and then down to (7,5).
7. Finally, proceed rightward from (7,5) to reach the end point at (7,7).

Describing this route as coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (4,6) (4,5) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
