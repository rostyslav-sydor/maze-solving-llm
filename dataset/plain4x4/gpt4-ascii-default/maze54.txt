To solve the maze, I will execute a search algorithm starting from the entry point (1,1), considering the constraints of the walls (#) and open paths (spaces). Below is the step-by-step walkthrough of the path found:

1. Start at (1,1), move right to (1,2).
2. Continue to the right to (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
3. Move down to (2,5).
4. Continue down to (3,5).
5. Move left to (3,4), (3,3), and (3,2).
6. Move down to (4,2), then to (5,2) and continue to (6,2).
7. Move right to (6,3), then to (6,4).
8. Move up to (5,4), then to (4,4).
9. Move to the right to (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7).
10. Continue moving down to (5,7), then to (6,7), and finally to (7,7), the exit point.

The path avoids all walls and transitions exclusively through open spaces, resulting in the correct solution to navigate from S to E.
