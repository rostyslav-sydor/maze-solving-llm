Here's a solution using a depth-first search algorithm, which processes the maze by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path treats the top left as the origin marked by coordinates `(1,1)`. The movements are entirely towards the east initially, until reaching the first possible southerly path at `(2,7)`, and continuing south until reaching the exit at `(7,7)`. The path avoids any unnecessary detours or backtracking, moving straightforward as constraints by the walls allow.

The approach used here ensures the shortest path possible given the linear structure of the maze on the eastmost column from starting to ending point, minimally interacting with middle barriers.
