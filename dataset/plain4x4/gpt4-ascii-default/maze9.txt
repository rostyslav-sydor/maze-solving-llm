Reasoning:
Starting at (1,1), the path approaches the exit by primarily progressing East and occasionally South, avoiding walls. In positions with multiple options, southern and eastern moves are prioritized, helping towards the goal at (7,7). This specific route navigates through openings in the walls and covers all available paths, carefully avoiding any dead ends, such as the fully enclosed space at the center. The choices made ensure continuous progression towards the exit without retracing steps, culminating at (7,7), the designated endpoint.
