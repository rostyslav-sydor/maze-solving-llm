The path can be found using a common pathfinding algorithm like depth-first search or breadth-first search. Starting at the entry point 'S' which is (1,1), we explore each possible movement direction: up, down, left, and right, avoiding walls and backtracking if a dead end is hit. Here's the path from (1,1) to (7,7):

1. Start at S: (1,1).
2. Move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and then (1,7).
3. Move down to (2,7).
4. Move left to (2,6) and down to (3,6).
5. Continue moving down to (4,6), then move left to (4,5), (4,4).
6. Go down to (5,4), (6,4), then right to (6,5), down to (7,5), and right to (7,6) and finally to E at (7,7).
