To solve the maze:

1. Start at the beginning (1,1), where 'S' is located.
2. Move right until reaching the dead-end at (1,4).
3. Move downward to (3,4).
4. Move left to (3,3), then continue left to (3,1).
5. Move downward to (5,1).
6. Head right to (5,5).
7. Move downward to (6,5), then continue to (7,5).
8. Move right to reach the exit at (7,7), where 'E' is located.

This solution navigates through open paths, avoiding walls.

Output: <PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
