To solve this maze, we must find a path from the starting point 'S' (row 1, column 1) to the exit point 'E' (row 7, column 7). I will traverse the maze using a pathfinding algorithm, such as the breadth-first search (BFS), which is suitable for unweighted grids like this.

The path begins by moving right from the start since the only options are moving right or down and down leads to dead ends or loops back to the same path:
1. Move right from (1,1) to (1,8), which is the farthest reachable row without encountering a boundary or wall.
2. Move downward at (1,8) to the bottom at (7,8).
3. Move left from (7,8) to (7,7), directly to the exit.

Combining these moves, the coordinates are:

<PATH_START>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) (2,8) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) (7,7)
<PATH_END>

This is the simplest route as it navigates around the central wall structures without retracing steps unnecessarily or entering dead ends.
