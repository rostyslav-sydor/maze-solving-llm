To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (S), located at (1,1), and move towards the exit point (E) at (7,7). The path needs to avoid hash signs (#) representing walls.

1. Start at the entrance (1,1).
2. Move right to the end of the row (1,7).
3. Move down one step to (2,7).
4. Move left, bypassing wall openings until arriving at (2,2).
5. Move down into the opening at (3,2).
6. Move right until (3,5) where another wall is met.
7. Move down to (4,5).
8. Move left to (4,2) where the path descends further.
9. Move down to (5,2).
10. Pass right, broken by a wall section, to (5,4).
11. Move down to (6,4).
12. Move right bypassing the opening until (6,7).
13. Finally, move down to the exit (7,7).
