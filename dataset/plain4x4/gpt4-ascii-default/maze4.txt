To solve the maze, we need to navigate a path from 'S' to 'E' without crossing any walls ('#'). We will proceed as follows:

1. Start from 'S' located at (1,1).
2. Move right till wall at (1,3), then down to (2,3).
3. Continue down to (3,3), at the junction.
4. Move right to (3,7) where we cannot proceed and then down to (6,7).
5. From (6,7), move left to (6,3), considering non-wall spaces.
6. Go down from (6,3) to (7,3).
7. Continue right till you reach the exit 'E' at (7,7).

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This approach identifies a clear path from the start to the finish, avoiding all walls and ensuring the path is continuously connected from the entry to the exit.
