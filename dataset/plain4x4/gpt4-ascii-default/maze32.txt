To solve the maze, we will follow a pathfinding strategy like a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Here, we'll opt for BDS, as it's exhaustive and finds the shortest path. Starting at the entry point (1,1), the algorithm will explore available paths:

1. From (1,1), move right to (1,2), continue to (1,3).
2. From (1,3), move down to (2,3).
3. Travel right from (2,3) to (5,3).
4. Move down from (5,3) to (6,3).
5. Travel left from (6,3) to (6,1).
6. Move right from (6,1) to (7,1).
7. Travel from (7,1) down and right through (7,7).

Upon reaching (7,7), we have discovered the exit. Thus, the optimal path from S to E is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,2) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves was identified by picturing common pathfinding, visualizing clear movements in the maze layout.
