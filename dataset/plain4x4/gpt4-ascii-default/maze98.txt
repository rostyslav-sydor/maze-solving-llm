To solve the ASCII maze, we start from the entry point (1, 1), and attempt to reach the exit point (7, 7). We can only move horizontally or vertically to adjacent open cells (denoted by spaces, ' ').

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Starting at (1,1).
2. Move right up to (1, 7), as there are open spaces.
3. Move down from (1, 7) to (3, 7).
4. Move left to (3, 5) since (3,8) is a wall.
5. Move down to (5, 5).
6. Move left to (5, 3).
7. Move down to (7, 3).
8. Finally, move right to reach the exit at (7,7).

Thus, the path from start to end is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
