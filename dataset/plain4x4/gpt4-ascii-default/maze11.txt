<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (3,4) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start at point S (1,1) and move right (East) from (1,1) to (1,5) as that path is free from any obstacles.
2. Move downwards (South) passing through cells from (2,5) through (3,5), navigating around the wall.
3. At (3,5), change direction to left (West) through open cells (3,4) to (3,1).
4. Again, move down (South) from cell (3,1) to (6,1), bypassing another set of vertical walls.
5. From (6,1), move downward reaching the seventh row and turn right (East) again moving from (7,1) to (7,7) finally reaching the exit E.
6. We avoided walls by making lateral and longitudinal movements through open pathways and using turns to reach the destination successfully without retracing any steps or hitting any dead ends. The path smoothly circumvents all obstacles through open routes, following minimal turns.
