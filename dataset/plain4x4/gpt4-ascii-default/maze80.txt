<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To navigate from S to E: 

1. Start at (1,1) and move vertically downwards through column 1 as there are no obstacles. Continue this path until reaching (7,1).
2. At (7,1), a shift to the right begins since moving further down is blocked. Traverse horizontally to the right through row 7.
3. Continue from (7,1) to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) and finally to (7,7) where the exit E is located.

This strategy is a straightforward approach since every movement forward during both the vertical and horizontal paths is unimpeded by walls, making it a valid and quick solution.
