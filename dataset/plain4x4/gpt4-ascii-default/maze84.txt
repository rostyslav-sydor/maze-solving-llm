To solve the maze, start at the entry point S (1,1) and use a maze traversal algorithm, such as depth-first search or breadth-first search. You move through connected pathways that are not marked by a wall (#). Here's an optimal path from S to E traced manually:

1. From the starting point S at (1,1), first move right to explore the clear spaces.
2. Continue moving right through (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6).
3. At (1,7), move down to (2,7).
4. Continue moving down to (3,7) since there are no other available paths without backtracking.
5. From (3,7), move left to (3,6) and (3,5).
6. Continue left to (3,4) and (3,3) followed by moving down to (4,3).
7. Move left to (4,2) then down to (5,2), and again to (6,2).
8. Continue to move down to (7,2), then right to the exit E at (7,7), traversing through (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), and (7,6).

The complete path in the specified format would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (3,3) (4,3) (4,2) (5,2) (6,2) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
