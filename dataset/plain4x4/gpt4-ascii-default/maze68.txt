<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Starting from the "S" at (1,1).
2. All the cells in row 1 from (1,2) to (1,7) are open; thus, the path moves horizontally right toward column 7.
3. We can see that column 7 also has a clear vertical path from row 2 to 7, with the only wall at (2,7) not blocking passage from above.
4. Navigate straight down column 7 from (2,7) to (7,7).
5. The path leads directly to "E" at (7,7) without the need for any detours or additional movements in other directions, as all necessary spaces are free.
