To solve the maze, we'll use simple maze traversal strategies. Starting at the entry point S at (1,1), the task is to reach the exit point E at (7,7). Due to the maze's configuration, the simplest applicable strategy is a depth-first search or a step-by-step navigation avoiding walls and backtracking if a dead end is encountered.

We'll navigate as follows:

1. Move from (1,1) to (1,7) horizontally right as there are no walls in-between.
2. Move down from (1,7) to (3,7).
3. Move left from (3,7) to (3,6).
4. Move down from (3,6) to (5,6).
5. Move right from (5,6) to (5,7).
6. Move down from (5,7) to (7,7), reaching the exit.

Our resulting movement coordinate sequence to solve the maze, starting from S and reaching E:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path respects all wall boundaries and takes every possible correct turn to reach the exit without revisiting any point.
