<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution follows a mainly downward path, veering eastward later where pathways open up. Starting from the entry point 'S' in the top left:

1. Move straight down from (1,1) to (6,1) since there's an open path.
2. Then move right (eastward) from (6,1) to (6,6) as the continuous open rightward path allows.
3. Finally, go down from (6,6) to (7,6) and one step right to the exit (7,7).

This route avoids all walls and successfully arrives at the exit while being among the simplest paths, continuously exploiting the vertical channel first, then making a turn toward the east, and finally a small southward adjustment to reach 'E'.
