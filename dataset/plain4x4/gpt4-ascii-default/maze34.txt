<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start from the entry point (1,1).
2. Since there is no obstruction, move rightwards from (1,2) to (1,7) - progressing through the maze's unrestricted first row.
3. Upon reaching the end of this row, move downward along column 7, from (2,7) through to (6,7).
4. Upon reaching (6,7), the bottom of the maze is reached, which is immediately adjacent to the exit point (7,7). Though (7,7) is marked "E" indicating exit, the given challenge was to reach spaces *near* the exit, hence, the movement stops after reaching (6,7).
5. This path avoids all walls and navigates through open spaces, following a simple rightward and downward trajectory that makes the use of available open lanes in the initial and last rows.
