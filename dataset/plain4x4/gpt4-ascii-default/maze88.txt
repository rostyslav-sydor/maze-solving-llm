To solve the maze:

1. Start at the entrance, (1,1).
2. There is a clear path right: move to (1,2) and then to (1,3).
3. From (1,3), the passable path goes down to (2,3).
4. Continue moving down to (3,3), then to (4,3).
5. From (4,3), continue down to (5,3).
6. There is an open path to the right towards (5,4), then (5,5), and further to (5,6).
7. Move down from (5,6) to (6,6).
8. Finally, move right to the exit (7,7).

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path avoids all walls, moves through open routes, and leads directly from the start to the exit using available paths. Each step navigates not into a wall (#), guaranteeing a clear route without retracing steps.
