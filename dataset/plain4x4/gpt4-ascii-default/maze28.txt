To solve this maze, I performed a manual Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores the maze level-by-level and prioritizes finding the shortest path to the exit.

Starting from the 'S' at (1,1), I explored all possible directions: down and right, avoiding walls and backtracking.

Steps:
1. From (1,1), move right to (1,2), (1,3), and then down to (2,3).
2. From (2,3), continue down to (3,3).
3. From (3,3), move right to (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6), then down to (4,6).
4. From (4,6), move left to (4,5), (4,4), then continuously move downwards reaching (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), and finally shifting right to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) where the exit is located.

Thus, the path coordinates are:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (4,5) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path avoids all obstacles, utilizes available corridors effectively, and terminates at the exit 'E'.
