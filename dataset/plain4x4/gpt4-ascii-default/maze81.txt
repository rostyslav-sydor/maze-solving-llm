To solve the maze, we'll use a systematic approach like Depth First Search (DFS) to explore paths from the starting point (S) at (1,1) until we reach the end (E) at (7,7). Starting from (S), move right since the top and left sides are blocked by walls. Continue moving right till you reach an opening south at (1,8). Move down into the vertical corridor starting at (2,8) going South till (7,8) adjacent to the end point (E). Now left into (7,7). 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) (2,8) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) (7,7) <PATH_END>

The above steps track movements from the opening to the end, moving primarily right, then dropping down a vertical passage, and finally a short left movement to reach the exit. This path provides a continuous route without backtracking or dead ends.
