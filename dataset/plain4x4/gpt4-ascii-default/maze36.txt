To solve the maze, one could typically apply a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or A* Search Algorithm. Here, starting from the entrance 'S' at (1, 1), we explore adjacent paths while avoiding walls '#' and aim to reach the exit 'E' at (7, 7).

Tracing the movement step-by-step:
1. Begin at S (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7) until encountering an open path downward at (1, 7).
3. Move downward to (2, 7), then (3, 7).
4. Move left to (3, 6), then (3, 5).
5. Move downward to (4, 5), then right to (4, 6) and (4, 7).
6. Move down to (5, 7), then (6, 7), then (7, 7) where the exit E is located.

This path involves moving through opened passages, bypassing all walls. 
Here's the step-by-step path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
This solution traces a route that safely navigates through the maze from the start to the exit.
