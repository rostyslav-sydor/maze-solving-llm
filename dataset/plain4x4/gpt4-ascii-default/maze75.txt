To solve this maze, we'll proceed with a straightforward pathfinding approach, focusing on avoiding dead ends and the walls denoted by "#" while moving towards the exit "E". We will employ a greedy or direct method that allows us to move right or down, as these directions generally direct us to the exit while minimizing backtracks.

The path from the entry "S" (1,1) to the exit "E" (7,7) is as follows:

<PATH_START>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7)
<PATH_END>

Explanation:
1. Start at (1,1).
2. Traverse right till (1,4) until a wall blocks the way.
3. Go down to (3,4), continue to the right from (3,5) to (3,7).
4. At (3,7), move down to (4,7).
5. Continue moving down to the bottom row until reaching the exit at (7,7). 

This solution follows the simplest path to the exit with consideration for impassable walls.
