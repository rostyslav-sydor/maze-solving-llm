To solve this maze, I can start at the entry point S at (1,1) and follow a path through open spaces (" "), aiming to reach the exit point E at (7,7). I will avoid walls marked by "#". 

Starting from (1,1), move:
- Right to (1,2) and (1,3).
- Down to (2,3).
- Right to (3,3).
- Down to (3,4) because the passage to the right is blocked.
- Right to (4,4) and (5,4).
- Down to (5,5) and (5,6).
- Right to (5,7).
- Down to (6,7).
- Right to the exit at (7,7).

This path avoids all walls and connects the start and exit of the maze while moving solely through permissible open spaces.

Thus, the full path in the given format is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>
