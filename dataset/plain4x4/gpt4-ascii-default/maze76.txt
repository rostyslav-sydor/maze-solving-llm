Explanation:
- Starting from (1,1), moved horizontally to the far right of the first row to (1,7) as these are all open paths.
- Moved down to the third row at (3,7) to overcome the wall from the second row.
- Then, traveled left to (3,4) to bypass closed routes, utilizing the opening in the vertical wall section.
- Continued downward at column 4 to (5,4), taking advantage of the open vertical space.
- Moved right to (5,6) to again utilize open horizontal space.
- Proceeded straight down from (6,6) to the exit at (7,7), using open vertical paths to reach the destination.
