<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
The starting point (S) is at (1,1). There are no obstacles immediately after it, so the path moves straight horizontally from (1,2) up to (1,6). At (1,6), we need to curve down as (1,7) is blocked. Moving down the column, the path follows (2,6) and (3,6). Again a turn is needed to the left because moving further down is blocked by walls, so the path moves left from (3,6) to (3,5), then (3,4). 

Here, the path changes direction again turning downwards. To avoid backtracking or hitting walls, the only option from here is moving straight down and slightly right, passing through (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). Then, close to the end (E), the path shifts slightly to the right moving horizontally from (7,5) to (7,6) and finally arriving at the exit at (7,7).
