To find a path through the maze, we can visually trace from the start (S) at (1,1) to the end (E) at (7,7), avoiding walls ('#') and stepping only on spaces. Following the simplest route from the start, we would move right and downwards when possible.

<PATH_START> 
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) 
(2,5) 
(3,5) (3,6) (3,7) 
(4,7) 
(5,7) 
(6,7) 
(7,7) 
<PATH_END>

Rationalizing each step:
- Starting at (1,1) and moving to the right (1,5).
- Taking the first opportunity to move downward when reaching (2,5).
- Continuing downward until a path to slowly move right and down opens up at intermittent points (3,5 to 3,7).
- Continue moving downward directly from (4,7) till (7,7), as there are no walls blocking the straight vertical movement.

This provides a clear and effective path from entry to exit.
