To solve the maze, we can start from the entry point (1,1) and explore potential paths avoiding wall cells marked by hashes (#). We'll use a search algorithm to traverse through open paths (spaces) until the exit point (7,7) is reached.

Starting at S, we can move right to avoid the immediate wall downwards:
1. Start moving right from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) until we reach (1,4) where progression further right is blocked by a wall.

2. From (1,4), move downwards to (2,4) then to (3,4). Move right again to (3,5) and continue to (3,6).

3. At (3,6), move downwards through (4,6), (5,6) to (6,6). 

4. Once at (6,6), we can only move right to (6,7) and then down to (7,7) where the exit point E is located.

The solution for the maze as a path of coordinates starting from (1,1) and leading to (7,7) would be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path avoids all walls and reaches the exit effectively.
