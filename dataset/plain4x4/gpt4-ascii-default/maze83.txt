<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. **Start at S (1,1)**: Begin at the entry of the maze.
2. **Move Right**: Proceed rightward to explore the clear path, bypassing walls indicated by '#'. Movement continues until reaching the far right-side opening at the end of the first row.
3. **Descend**: Once the path rightward from (1,7) is blocked by walls, the next available movement is downward. Sequentially move down avoiding walls until reaching the bottom row.
4. **Conclude at E (7,7)**: This final downward movement leads to the maze's exit.

This solution follows the clear linear right and down path available from the start to the exit within the constraint of the maze layout, avoiding all wall obstacles efficiently.
