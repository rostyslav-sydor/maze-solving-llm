To solve the maze, I visually inspected and followed possible paths from S (start) to E (end) while avoiding walls. Here's the solution traced manually:

1. Start at (1,1), move right across top row to (1,7).
2. Move down to (3,7).
3. From (3,7), move left through the gap in the walls to (3,3).
4. Move downwards to (4,3), then continue moving down to (7,3).
5. From (7,3), move right to the endpoint (7,7).

This yields the path:

```
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
```

This sequence avoids all walls and arrives at the exit efficiently using primarily a straight path in feasible corridor directions.
