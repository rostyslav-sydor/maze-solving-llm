To solve the maze, let's trace a route from the start point S to the exit point E, using a search technique such as depth-first search or breadth-first search.

Starting from S at (1,1):
1. Move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).
2. From (1,4), move down to (2,4), then (3,4).
3. From (3,4), move right to (3,5) and continue to (3,6).
4. Move down from (3,6) to (4,6), then to (5,6), down to (6,6), and finally to (7,6).
5. From (7,6), move right to reach E at (7,7).

By following these steps, you would successfully navigate through the maze, avoiding walls, and reaching the target.

Final path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This sequence follows a straightforward path with minimal backtracking and tries to proceed 'right' or 'down' as much as possible, which effectively leads to the exit without hitting dead ends.
