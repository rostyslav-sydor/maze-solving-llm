To solve the maze effectively, we'll use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) that can thoroughly explore the maze from 'S' to 'E'. We will explore paths grid-wise, moving through open spaces (' ') while avoiding walls ('#'). We use a systematic approach to navigate from the start (S) to exit (E), ensuring every step is saved as coordinates.

Here's the solution path based on logical navigation:

1. Starting at the point 'S' located at (1,1).
2. Move rightwards to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) since these are open spaces.
3. From (1,5), move downward to (2,5) followed by (3,5), as they are connected directly below.
4. From (3,5), move right (open) to (3,6).
5. Move downwards from (3,6) through (4,6), (5,6), and (6,6) to (7,6).
6. Move right from (7,6) to (7,7) at the exit 'E'.

Each move is checked to ensure it avoids walls and follows open paths. The solution is thus:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
