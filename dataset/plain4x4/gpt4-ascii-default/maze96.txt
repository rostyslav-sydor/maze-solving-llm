To solve this maze, we start from the entry point labeled 'S' at (1,1) and explore paths until reaching the exit point 'E' at (7,7). The solution involves moving through open paths marked by spaces while avoiding hash-marked walls.

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Move right across row 1 to (1,7).
3. Move down one row to (2,7).
4. Move left to (2,3).
5. Move down to (7,3), passing through multiple junctions, all in column 3.
6. Move right from (7,3) to (7,7), reaching the exit.

The sequence of moves avoids walls and successfully navigates through the corridors that are accessible.

Solution:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (2,6) (2,5) (2,4) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
