To solve the maze, we will use a systematic approach to trace a path from 'S' (Start) to 'E' (End) manually, following simple maze-solving strategies like the "right-hand rule" (keeping your right hand in contact with a wall to navigate). The solution assumes we start on (1,1) and explore accessible paths (spaces, not '#') by moving right, down, left, or up without backtracking unnecessarily.

Here’s the step-by-step path solution:

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Move right up till (1,7).
3. Move down to (2,7), then (3,7).
4. Move left to (3,6).
5. Navigate more leftwards to (3,4).
6. Move downwards all the way past (4,4), (5,4) to (6,4).
7. Proceed right to finally reach (6,5), (6,6), and finally the exit at (7,6).

Thus, the shortest path through the maze from the entry point 'S' at (1,1) to the exit 'E' at (7,6) is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) <PATH_END>

This output lists coordinates that represent consecutive steps to navigate successfully from start to end.
