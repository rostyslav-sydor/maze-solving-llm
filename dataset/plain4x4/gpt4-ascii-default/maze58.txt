<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze:
1. Start at the entry point, S, which has the coordinates (1,1).
2. Identify paths by moving horizontally or vertically, avoiding walls represented by "#".
3. From the start, head right until reaching the third column at (1,3).
4. At (1,3), move downwards vertically, travelling through column 3, to avoid walls in the way.
5. At (4,3), start moving to the right; continue moving right until reaching column 7.
6. Then, continue moving downward until reaching the exit, E, at (7,7).
7. This path takes advantage of clear rows and columns to minimize encounters with walls, ensuring a safe path to the exit.
