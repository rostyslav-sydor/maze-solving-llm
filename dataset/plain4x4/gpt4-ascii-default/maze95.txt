To solve the maze, we'll use a common pathfinding approach to find the shortest path from the start (S) to the exit (E). Here's the solution based on a straightforward Breadth-First Search (BFS) exploration of viable paths:

1. Start from the initial position (1,1).
2. Explore all possible moves from the current location (i.e., move right, left, up, or down) while avoiding walls and ensuring not to go out of the maze’s boundaries.
3. Once a path moves into a new open space (' '), mark it to prevent revisiting.
4. Continue exploring until the exit (7,7) is reached.

The path followed from the start (S) to the exit (E) is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path was chosen as it follows the clearest route on the maze map directly from the start to the end through open pathways, avoiding dead ends and loops.
