To solve this maze, we conduct a pathfinding search from the start (S) at (1,1) to the exit (E) at (7,7). Here is a reasonable solution derived from the maze structure:

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Move right to (1,5).
3. Move down to (5,5).
4. Move left to (5,1).
5. Move down to (7,1).
6. Move right to the exit at (7,7).

Putting it all together:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (5,2) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This route is intuitive from an inspection of the maze, as corridors mostly run vertically and horizontally with blocking walls that need workarounds. The solution finds a path that navigates these corridors and constraints efficiently, avoiding dead ends and backtracking.
