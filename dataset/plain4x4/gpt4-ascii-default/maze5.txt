Explanation:
- Starting from S, the only direction without a wall is downward. Move from (1,1) to (2,1).
- Continue downward to (3,1); then move right to (3,2) and (3,3).
- From (3,3), go down to (4,3) and continue right to (4,4) and (4,5).
- Move down to (5,5), and continue in the same column down to (6,5), then to (7,5).
- Finally, move right to (7,6) and further to (7,7) where E is located, which is the exit of the maze. 

This route is concluded as shortest as it avoids unnecessary turns or backtracking while navigating solely through clear paths (' ') adjacent to the current position to reach 'E' (Exit).
