To solve this maze, we start at the entry point (1,1) and need to navigate to the exit point (7,7). The walls are represented by '#' and cannot be traversed. The process involves finding a path that only moves through empty spaces represented by ' '.

Here’s the step-by-step path solution from entry (S) to exit (E):
1. From S at (1,1), move right to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7).
2. At (1,7), move down to (2,7) and further down to (3,7).
3. From (3,7), no direct path right due to a wall, move left through (3,6) to (3,1).
4. At (3,1), move downwards consecutive steps to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and then to (7,1).
5. Move right from (7,1) through (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), and finally to the exit point at (7,7).

Final path:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>
This solution is one of the potential paths through the maze, navigating around the walls to reach the exit.
