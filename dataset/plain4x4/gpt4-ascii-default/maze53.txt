To solve the maze, we follow the open paths from the starting point "S" at coordinate (1,1) to the ending point "E" at (7,7), avoiding the walls "#".

Starting from (1,1), the path is:
1. Move right from (1,1) to (1,4), as open spaces are indicated by empty spots.
2. Move down from (1,4) to (6,4).
3. Move right from (6,4) to (6,5).
4. Move down from (6,5) to (7,5).
5. Finally, move right from (7,5) to (7,7), the end point.

Summarizing the path, taking only steps needed to solve the maze:

<PATH_START>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)
(2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4)
(6,5)
(7,5) (7,6) (7,7)
<PATH_END>

This path solution resolves the maze, managing to navigate from S to E efficiently without colliding into any walls and using the shortest possible route available in the given ASCII layout.
