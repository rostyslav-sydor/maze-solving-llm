The adjacency list provided describes the connections between cells in the maze format:

<ADJLIST_START> (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (3,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,2) <--> (1,2) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (3,1) <--> (2,1) ; <ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> 
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

The adjacency list can be transformed into an easier format to work with. We'll need to start at origin (0,0) and find a path to the target (3,3):

1. Construct a graph from the adjacency list.
2. Apply a pathfinding algorithm such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), or Dijkstra's Algorithm.
   
For the given maze, let's analyze the connections:
- Starting at (0,0), adjacent nodes are (1,0) and (0,1).
- Then from (0,1), you can proceed to (0,2).
- From (0,2), move to either (0,3) or to (1,2).
- Continue transitioning like this towards the target (3,3).

You can use either manual tracing or a pathfinding algorithm on the formatted adjacency list, ensuring connectivity and that there's a direct or indirect path to (3,3):

Possible solution:
<PATH_START>
(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)
<PATH_END>

Here, every step transitions directly to a connected cell leading from the origin to the target.
However, one ought to confirm this path does not contain loops using the list of edges provided in the adjacency list format to verify each step is allowed according to maze rules. For maze solvers, graph libraries and algorithms in programming languages can automatically perform this check and find the path.
