To solve the maze, we need to determine a valid path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm based on the given adjacency list. The adjacency list defines the connectivity between nodes (each node is represented as a coordinate pair (row, column)).

Given Adjacency List:
```
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(2,0) <--> (2,1)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,3) <--> (0,2)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(1,1) <--> (0,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(2,1) <--> (3,1)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
```

Converting this list to a graph structure where keys are nodes and values are a list of connected nodes:

```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (1,0): [(2,0), (1,1)],
    (2,0): [(2,1)],
    (3,2): [(2,2), (3,3)],
    (1,2): [(2,2)],
    (0,3): [(1,3), (0,2)],
    (0,2): [(0,1)],
    (1,1): [(0,1)],
    (2,3): [(3,3)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (2,1)],
    (3,3): [(2,3)],
    (2,2): [(3,2)],
    (2,1): [(3,1)],
}
```

Now, a DFS search is implemented:

```python
def dfs(graph, start, end):
    stack, path = [(start, [start])], set()
    while stack:
        (vertex, route) = stack.pop()
        if vertex in path:
            continue
        if vertex == end:
            return route
        path.add(vertex)
        for neighbor in graph.get(vertex, []):
            stack.append((neighbor, route + [neighbor]))
    return None
```

We call dfs with the graph, the origin, and the target:

```python
origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)
path = dfs(graph, origin, target)
```

The path returned will be:

```
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3)
```

Within the requested format:

```markdown
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This provides the sequence of maze cells one must traverse to move from the entrance to the exit.
