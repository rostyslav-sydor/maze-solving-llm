To solve this maze, we will analyze the adjacency list to build a graph and apply a graph traversal algorithm (like breadth-first search or depth-first search) to find the path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

### Adjacency List Analysis:
From the given list:
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)

Using this list, we can build the graph representation and determine a viable path from the origin to the destination.

### Graph Representation:
- (0,0) can move to [(1,0), (0,1)]
- (0,1) can move to [(0,0), (1,1)]
- (0,3) can move to [(0,2), (1,3)]
- ...
- (3,3) can move to [(3,2), (2,3)]

### Path Search Algorithm:

We start at (0,0):
1. From (0,0), neighbors are (1,0) and (0,1).
2. Move to (0,1); from (0,1), move to (0,0), (1,1). Already visited (0,0), go to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), move to (0,1) already visited, consider (1,2).
4. Move to (1,2); from (1,2), neighbors are (1,1), (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (2,3) and (0,3). Go to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move to (3,3).
7. Arrive at (3,3) our target point.

### Solution Path:
Thus, a possible path to solve the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves through adjacent nodes in the graph that are connected until reaching the destination (3,3).
