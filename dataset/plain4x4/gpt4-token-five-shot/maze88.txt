To solve the maze presented in the last description, we will translate the adjacency list to a graph representation and then use a graph traversal algorithm, like breadth-first search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here's the breakdown of the adjacency list to understand the connections:
```
<ADJLIST_START>
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(0,1) <--> (1,1)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
<ADJLIST_END>
```

Origin: `(0,0)`
Target: `(3,3)`

Using the connections described above, the BFS algorithm would find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) as follows:
1. Start from `(0,0)`
2. Move to `(0,1)` (direct connection)
3. Move to `(1,1)` (direct connection)
4. Move to `(1,2)` via connection to `(2,2)` or to `(1,0)` and continue, but both ways eventually reach `(2,2)`
5. Proceed to `(2,3)` from `(2,2)` (direct connection)
6. From `(2,3)`, reach `(3,3)` (direct connection)

Thus, the path can be represented as:
```
<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END>
```

This path efficiently traces through the graph using the given connections without any loops or backtrack.
