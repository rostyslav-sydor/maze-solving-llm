To solve the maze problem described by this adjacency list, we'll analyze the connections and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by implementing a graph traversal algorithm.

Given the adjacency list:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (1,3) <--> (0,3) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; <ADJLIST_END>

### Parse the Adjacency List
From the adjacency list, we can list down the connections:

- (0,0) with neighbors: (0,1)
- (0,1) with neighbors: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1)
- (0,2) with neighbors: (0,1), (0,3)
- (0,3) with neighbors: (0,2), (1,3)
- (1,0) with neighbors: (1,1), (2,0)
- (1,1) with neighbors: (1,0), (0,1)
- (1,2) with neighbors: (1,3)
- (1,3) with neighbors: (1,2), (0,3)
- (2,0) with neighbors: (1,0), (3,0)
- (2,1) with neighbors: (2,2)
- (2,2) with neighbors: (2,1), (2,3)
- (2,3) with neighbors: (2,2), (3,3)
- (3,0) with neighbors: (2,0), (3,1)
- (3,1) with neighbors: (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,2) with neighbors: (3,1), (3,3)
- (3,3) with neighbors: (2,3), (3,2)

### Path-Finding
We'll use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) method here starting from (0,0) aiming to find (3,3):

**BFS Process**:
1. Start at (0,0). Queue: [(0,0)]
2. Path: (0,0).
3. Visit neigbors of (0,0) -> (0,1). 
4. From (0,1), potential pathway could be to (0,2).
5. From (0,2), potential pathway could be to (0,3).
6. From (0,3), potential pathway could be to (1,3).
7. From (1,3), potential pathway could be to (1,2).
8. From (1,2), potential pathway is limited and doesn't advance towards (3,3).

**Retry a Path**:
Starting again from (0,0) and moving towards beneficial directions:
1. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1).
2. (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0).
3. (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).
4. (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

Result:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
