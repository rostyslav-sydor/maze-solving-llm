To find the solution to the maze represented by the last given adjacency list, we explore the paths that can be taken from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` based on the connected vertices. Here's the adjacency list detail from the maze input:

```
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(1,2) <--> (0,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(1,1) <--> (0,1)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,0) <--> (2,0)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
```

This list states which cells are directly connected. Using this information, we can track potential routes to reach the target `(3,3)` from the origin point `(0,0)`.
Here, using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), we can efficiently find a path (if it exists) between these two points. I'll map the adjacency list and simulate the BFS to visualize the correct path.

### Relationship Mapping
- From `(0,0)`, direct paths are to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, direct paths are to `(0,0)`, and `(1,1)`.
- Follow each directly connected cell, while avoiding revisits, and eventually reaching `(3,3)`.

### Pathfinding using BFS
1. Starting at `(0,0)`.
2. Next, visit `(0,1)`.
3. From `(0,1)`, move to `(1,1)`.
4. From `(1,1)`, move to options `(0,1)` and `(1,2)`, where `(0,1)` is already visited.
5. From `(1,2)`, move next to `(0,2)` or `(2,2)`.
6. Moving to `(2,2)`, you have options to switch to `(1,2)` or `(2,1)`.
7. From `(2,2)`, go to `(2,3)`.
8. From `(2,3)`, move to `(1,3)` or `(3,3)`.
9. Arriving at `(3,3)` signifies a path is found.

Tracing these steps gives the solution path:

### Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path represents a valid sequence of movements through the maze from the origin to the target based on the logical connections and constraints set by the adjacency list.
