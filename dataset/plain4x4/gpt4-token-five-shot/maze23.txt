To find a solution for the maze presented in the last detail, we need to determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided:

Given Adjacency List:
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)

Building the graph from the adjacency list and finding a path from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Build the graph connections:
- `{(0,0): [(1,0)], (1,0): [(0,0), (1,1)], (1,1): [(1,0), (2,1)], (2,1): [(1,1), (3,1)], (3,1): [(3,0), (2,1), (3,2)], (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)], (1,2): [(0,2), (1,3), (2,2)], (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3)], (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)], (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)], (0,2): [(0,3), (1,2), (0,1)], (0,3): [(0,2)], (2,2): [(1,2), (2,3)], (3,2): [(3,1), (3,3)], (2,0): [(3,0)], (0,1): [(0,2)]}`

2. Apply Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from (0,0) to target (3,3):
    - Start at (0,0).
    - Explore all the reachable nodes and track path and visitation status.
    - Follow through to find continuation and end up at (3,3).
    - A possible path would traverse through the connections such (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), and then leading to (3,1) and (3,2) or directly connecting to (3,3).

After tracing this BFS path:

**Solution:**
<PATH_START>
(0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
<PATH_END>

This path uses all openings between nodes provided by the adjacency list and ensures all moves are connecting without any break in between them. This solution is contingent upon no isolated disjoint segments in the mazeâ€™s representation.
