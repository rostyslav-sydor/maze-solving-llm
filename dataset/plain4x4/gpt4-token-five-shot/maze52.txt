To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list and find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)`, we can utilize a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

First, let's interpret the described adjacency list:

```plaintext
(1,0) <--> (1,1)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(1,2) <--> (2,2)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,3)
(3,2) <--> (3,1)
(2,1) <--> (3,1)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(2,3) <--> (2,2)
```

**Graph Structure:**
- Nodes: Coordinates (rows, columns).
- Edges: Connections allowing to move between accessible neighboring nodes according to the adjacency list.

### Graph Representation

Using the information above:

- Start Node: `(0,0)`
- Goal Node: `(3,3)`
  
### Proposed Solution Approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Represent the adjacency list as a graph using a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of connected nodes.
2. Use BFS to ensure the shortest path:
    - Start from `(0,0)`.
    - Explore all connections (neighbors).
    - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops.
    - Store and update the parent for each node to reconstruct the path.

### Execution: BFS Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:
    - `queue` to track nodes to explore.
    - `visited` to know which nodes have been visited.
    - `parent` to reconstruct the path once we reach the destination.
   
2. **Process**:
    - Begin from `(0,0)`, mark as visited.
    - For each neighbor of the current node not visited yet, enqueue, mark as visited, and store its parent.
    - Continue until the goal `(3,3)` is reached or all possible paths are explored.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
    - Start from `(3,3)` and backtrack using the parent dictionary until reaching the origin `(0,0)`.

### Reconstruction the path based on BFS:

For the maze discussed:

If we apply BFS correctly considering the given adjacency, the process should find the shortest path, assuming it exists according to its designed adjacent rules.

However, for a specific path reconstruction without implementing the BFS code here due to environment restrictions, it's essential to validate that all intended connections exist and are correctly joined based on the given adjacency, then traverse the path:

Following is an example solution path, preliminarily determined by the adjacency model given in plain text:

```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Interpreting the adjacency list, the path moves through connected neighbors:
- From the origin `(0,0)` progressing through to `(1,0)`, aligned to the adjacency list.
- Continuing towards `(1,1)`, then reaching out to `(2,1)`.
- Reaching `(3,1)` via connected nodes, moving to `(3,2)` and finally reaching the destination `(3,3)`.

This path looks feasible given the connections in the adjacency list where every step is adjacent to the next and is recorded based on typical graph traversal strategy assuming the graph details are correct.
