To find the solution for the last maze, we first parse the adjacency list into a format that we can use to search for a path from the origin to the target. The origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). The adjacency list indicates all direct connections between nodes in the maze. 

Parsing the adjacency list into a usable form:

- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)

Next step is to use a pathfinding algorithm, often Breadth-First Search (BFS), to traverse this graph from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), tracking the coordinate path.

Upon performing the BFS, a possible found path is:
1. Starting from (0,0), we move either to (1,0) or (0,1).
2. From (0,1), we can move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), we can move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), we can move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), we can move to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), we can move to (2,2).
7. From (2,2), we can move to (2,3).
8. Finally from (2,3), we can move to (3,3).

The solution from the BFS traversal, in the specified output format, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
