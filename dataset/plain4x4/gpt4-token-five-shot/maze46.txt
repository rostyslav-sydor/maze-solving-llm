To solve the provided maze, we first need to interpret the adjacency list to determine the possible moves from each passage. Then, we use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find a path from the origin to target by exploring systematically through each connected node.

**Maze Representation:**
- Maze is structured in adjacency list format where pairs of coordinates are listed to denote direct connections.
- The origin is at coordinates `(0,0)`, and the target is at coordinates `(3,3)`.

**Adjacency List (Extracted from the Query):**
```
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (3,1) <--> (2,1) ;
(2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ;
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ;
```

**Converting it to Graph Representation in Dictionary form for BFS:**

```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(0,1), (1,0)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)],
    (0,3): [(0,2), (1,3)],
    (1,0): [(1,1)],
    (1,1): [(1,0), (1,2)],
    (1,2): [(1,1), (2,2)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3)],
    (2,0): [(2,1), (3,0)],
    (2,1): [(3,1), (2,2), (2,0)],
    (2,2): [(2,1), (1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,3): [(2,2), (1,3), (3,3)],
    (3,0): [(3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2), (2,1)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
}
```

**Applying Breadth-First Search for the path from (0,0) to (3,3):**

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_path(graph, start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()

        if current == target:
            return path

        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    return []

# Now call the BFS function with given entry and exit points mentioned
path = bfs_path(graph, (0,0), (3,3))
```

**Solution for the Maze** (Assuming the BFS function returns a valid path):

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This is based on the BFS traversal and the connections directly derived from the adjacency list provided in the maze description. The route avoids unnecessary turns based on adjacency.
