To find the solution to the maze represented in the adjacency list, I will first reconstruct the adjacency graph, identify the entry point (origin) and exit point (target), then use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

According to the given data:

### Maze Adjacency List
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(2,3) <--> (3,3) ; 
(3,0) <--> (2,0) ; 
(2,0) <--> (1,0) ; 
(3,2) <--> (3,3) ; 
(1,3) <--> (2,3) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) ; 
(0,3) <--> (1,3) ; 
(0,2) <--> (1,2) ; 
(2,2) <--> (2,3) ; 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) ; 
(0,2) <--> (0,1) ; 
(2,2) <--> (2,1) ; 
(0,0) <--> (1,0) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ; 
(0,1) <--> (0,0) ; 
<ADJLIST_END> 
```

### Entry (Origin) and Exit (Target) Points
```
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

### Solution Process:

- Convert the adjacency list into a usable graph format.
- Implement BFS or another pathfinding algorithm to determine the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3).
  
For this specific case:

#### Maze Graph:
- Constructed from the adjacency list provided.

#### Pathfinding:
- Starting at (0,0), BFS will explore all possible paths through its neighbors. 
- By recording each step and ensuring that each cell is visited only once, BFS continues until it reaches the target node (3,3).

### BFS Solution Path Extraction
Given the way the adjacency list is structured, letâ€™s find the BFS path:
1. From (0,0), possible moves are to (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From these, expand further until reaching (3,3) using the connections.

#### Manual Graph Reconstruction:
- `(0,0)` connects to `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`.
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,2)`.
- `(0,2)` connects to `(1,2)`.
- `(1,2)` connects to `(1,3)`, `(2,2)`.
- `(1,3)` connects to `(2,3)`, `(0,3)`.
- `(2,3)` connects to `(3,3)`.
- `(3,3)` is also reached from `(3,2)`.

#### Path
Breaking down the path visually, we find:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move right to (0,2).
4. Move up to (1,2).
5. Move right to (1,3).
6. Move up to (2,3).
7. Move up to (3,3).

This gives the shortest path via BFS:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
