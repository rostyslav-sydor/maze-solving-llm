To find the solution to the maze provided in the last input, we first need to analyze the adjacency list and then use an algorithm (such as Breadth-First Search) to traverse from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

Given the adjacency list:
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(2,1) <--> (3,1) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) ; 
(1,2) <--> (2,2) ; 
(3,3) <--> (3,2) ; 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) ; 
(1,0) <--> (0,0) ; 
(0,2) <--> (0,3) ; 
(2,3) <--> (1,3) ; 
(3,3) <--> (2,3) ; 
(1,3) <--> (1,2) ; 
(3,0) <--> (3,1) ; 
(0,1) <--> (0,2) ; 
(1,0) <--> (2,0) ; 
(1,1) <--> (0,1) ; 
(2,0) <--> (2,1) ; 
<ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> 
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

**Graph Explanation**:
- Nodes (coordinates) and their respective connections are described.
- We need to find a path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.

**Approach** (Breadth-First Search - BFS):

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start from `(0,0)`.
   - Use a queue to store nodes to explore, and a dictionary to record paths.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Explore each node (coordinate). For each node, look up its neighbors based on the adjacency list.
   - If not visited, add them to the queue and update the path dictionary.

**Execution**:
Note that BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

1. Start at `(0,0)`. Neighbors are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`, store paths:
   - `(0,0) -> (1,0)`, 
   - `(0,0) -> (0,1)`.

2. From `(1,0)`, neighbors are `(0,0)` and `(2,0)`. Move to `(2,0)`, path now:
   - `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0)`.

3. From `(0,1)`, neighbors are `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`. Move to `(0,2)` (skip `(0,0)` visited), path:
   - `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)`.

4. Continue this pattern, ensuring no backtracking (revisiting nodes).

Executing BFS thoroughly, we can build the final path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`:
```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```
This direct BFS computation follows the connections as defined in the adjacency list.

Thus, the solution format as requested:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 
```
