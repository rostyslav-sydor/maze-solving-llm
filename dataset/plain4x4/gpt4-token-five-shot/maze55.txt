To solve this maze, we first translate the provided adjacency list into a usable graph format and then use a pathfinding algorithm to identify the route from the origin position `(0,0)` to the target position `(3,3)`.

Given the maze adjacency list:
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (1,3) <--> (0,3) ; 
(3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; 
(2,2) <--> (2,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,2) ; 
(2,3) <--> (3,3) ; 
<ADJLIST_END>
```

Here, we decode the adjacency list into graph connections:

Graph structure:
- `(1,0)` is connected to `(1,1)`
- `(1,3)` is connected to `(2,3)`
- `(1,2)` is connected to `(1,1)`
- `(3,2)` is connected to `(3,1)`
- `(1,3)` is connected to `(0,3)`
- `(3,0)` is connected to `(2,0)`
- `(2,3)` is connected to `(2,2)`
- `(0,1)` is connected to `(0,0)`
- `(3,2)` is connected to `(3,3)`
- `(3,0)` is connected to `(3,1)`
- `(2,2)` is connected to `(2,1)`
- `(0,2)` is connected to `(0,3)`
- `(2,0)` is connected to `(1,0)`
- `(0,1)` is connected to `(0,2)`
- `(2,3)` is connected to `(3,3)`

Using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:

BFS Pathfinding:
1. Start at `(0,0)`, which connects to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)` go to `(0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)` go to `(0,3)`.
4. From `(0,3)` go to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)`, choose `(2,3)` because it leads closer to the target.
6. From `(2,3)`, go to `(3,3)` direct.

Putting all together, the solution path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` is:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path ensures connectivity based on the adjacency pairs provided in the maze and leads directly to the target `(3,3)` from the start point `(0,0)`.
