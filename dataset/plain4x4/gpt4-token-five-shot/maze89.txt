To solve the given maze from origin `(0,0)` to target `(3,3)`, we establish the following adjacency relationship based on the adjacency list provided. We will parse this adjacency list and then use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), for finding the path in the preparsed graph.

### Parsing the Adjacency List
```
<ADJLIST_START>
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(0,0) <--> (1,0) 
(2,0) <--> (1,0) 
(1,3) <--> (2,3) 
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(2,2) <--> (1,2) 
(3,0) <--> (3,1) 
(1,3) <--> (0,3) 
(0,2) <--> (1,2) 
(2,0) <--> (3,0) 
<ADJLIST_END>
```

### Constructing the Graph
We'll create a graph with nodes represented as `(row, col)` coordinates:
- Nodes: 
  - (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)
  - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
  - (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)
  - (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
- Edges: From the adjacency relationships given (undirected connections).

### Implementing BFS for Search
We'll perform BFS from the origin `(0,0)` to find the shortest path towards `(3,3)`:
1. Start from origin `(0,0)`.
2. Check each adjacent node. Ideally keep track of visited nodes and maintain a queue for BFS.
3. Trace the path from the origin to the target once reached.

### BFS Algorithm Code
_(Pseudocode given a full list of maze edges and proper programming language could be implemented)_

```
# Pseudocode: Representing the maze in BFS algorithm
from queue import Queue

# Edges from parsed adjacency list
graph = {
    (0,0): {(0,1), (1,0)},
    (0,1): {(0,0), (0,2)},
    (0,2): {(0,1), (1,2), (0,3)},
    (0,3): {(0,2), (1,3)},
    (1,0): {(0,0), (2,0)},
    (1,1): {(2,1), (1,2)},
    (1,2): {(1,1), (2,2), (0,2), (1,3)},
    (1,3): {(0,3), (2,3), (1,2)},
    (2,0): {(1,0), (3,0)},
    (2,1): {(3,1), (1,1)},
    (2,2): {(1,2), (2,3)},
    (2,3): {(2,2), (1,3), (3,3)},
    (3,0): {(2,0), (3,1)},
    (3,1): {(3,0), (3,2), (2,1)},
    (3,2): {(3,3), (3,1)},
    (3,3): {(3,2), (2,3)}
}

origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)
queue = Queue()
queue.put((origin, [origin]))  # Queue stores tuples of (current_node, path_to_node)
visited = set()

while not queue.empty():
    current, path = queue.get()
    if current == target:
        return path
    visited.add(current)
    for neighbor in graph[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            queue.put((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

return []
```

### Final Path Solution
Following the BFS pseudocode, the expected path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` would be the one derived from the graph and BFS process.

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path represents a feasible traversal across the maze considering the adjacency relationships provided.
