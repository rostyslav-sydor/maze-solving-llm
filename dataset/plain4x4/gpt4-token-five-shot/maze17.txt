To solve the maze described by the adjacency list in the problem statement, we first need to identify the available paths defined by the adjacency relationships between coordinates. We then search for a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

Here's the adjacency list from the maze segment:

```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; 
(0,1) <--> (1,1) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ;
(1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; 
(2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (2,2) <--> (2,3) ; 
(1,3) <--> (0,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ;
<ADJLIST_END>
```

The origin and target are:
```
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

From the adjacency list, let's construct a graph structure for the maze:

```plaintext
{
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0), (2,1)],
    (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (0,1): [(1,1), (0,2)],
    (1,1): [(0,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)],
    (0,3): [(0,2), (1,3)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (1,2)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (2,2)],
    (2,2): [(1,2), (2,3)],
    (2,3): [(2,2), (3,3)],
    (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,2), (3,0)],
    (2,1): [(2,0)]
}
```

To identify a route from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`, we can perform a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).

Using BFS (for shortest path purposes):

1. Initialize a queue with the starting vertex `(0,0)` and an empty path list.
2. Explore the connected vertices branching out, marking each visited vertex.
3. Keep pushing the path to a queue until the target `(3,3)` is reached.

After solving the search:

Path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path is found by following the connections specified in the adjacency list, ensuring connectivity at each step, proceeding vertically downward through the first column, and then moving rightward and upward towards the target while making moves that continuously progress towards the target coordinate.
