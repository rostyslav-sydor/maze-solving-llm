To solve the last maze and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the provided adjacency list, let's first extract the reachable connections from each point:

Adjacency List Details:
- (3,0) <- --> (3,1); (2,0)
- (1,1) <- --> (1,2); (2,1); (0,1)
- (0,3) <- --> (0,2); (1,3)
- (1,0) <- --> (2,0); (0,0)
- (2,1) <- --> (1,1); (2,0); (3,1)
- (0,2) <- --> (0,1); (0,3)
- (0,1) <- --> (1,1); (0,2); (0,0)
- (3,3) <- --> (3,2); (2,3)
- (3,2) <- --> (3,3); (2,2)
- (2,3) <- --> (1,3); (3,3)
- (2,0) <- --> (3,0); (1,0); (2,1)
- (2,2) <- --> (3,2)

Starting from (0,0), we need to find a sequence of steps leading to (3,3).

Possible Solution Path (Step by Step BFS):
1. Begin at the origin, (0,0).
   - Neighbors: (0,1) and (1,0)
2. (0,0) -> (0,1)
   - New neighbors from (0,1): (1,1), (0,2)
3. (0,1) -> (1,1)
   - New neighbors from (1,1): (1,2), (2,1)
4. (1,1) -> (1,2)
   - New neighbors from (1,2): None new, continue
5. (1,2) -> (2,2)
   - New neighbors from (2,2): (3,2)
6. (2,2) -> (3,2)
   - New neighbors from (3,2): (3,3)
7. (3,2) -> (3,3)
   - Reach the target (3,3).

Taking the shortest path found using Breadth-first search, the solution for the path from (0,0) to (3,3) becomes:
<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3)
<PATH_END> 

This is not the only possible solution but provides one valid path using the provided adjacency list and connections.
