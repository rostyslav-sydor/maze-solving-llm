To find the solution to the maze given in the last example, we first build the adjacency list representation into a graph and then use a graph traversal algorithm to find a path from the origin to the target. Since the adjacency list is provided, let's first parse it and construct a graph, then apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze or graph.

**Maze**:
<ADJLIST_START>
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
<ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END> 

**Steps to solve using BFS**:
1. Construct the adjacency graph from the adjacency list.
2. Initialize a queue with the origin point (0,0).
3. Initialize a dictionary to track visited nodes and the path taken to reach them.
4. Start BFS from the origin:
   - Dequeue a node (current position) from the queue.
   - If this is the target, reconstruct the path from the visited dictionary. 
   - For each neighboring node of the current node, if it hasn't been visited, enqueue it and mark it as visited.
5. End BFS when the queue is empty or the target has been found.

**Constructed Graph**:
```
{
    (0, 0): [(0, 1)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 0), (1, 1)],
    (1, 1): [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2)],
    (1, 0): [(1, 1), (2, 0)],
    (3, 2): [(3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2)],
    (3, 1): [(3, 2), (3, 0)],
    (3, 3): [(3, 2)],
    (0, 2): [(1, 2)],
    (1, 2): [(0, 2), (2, 2)],
    (2, 2): [(1, 2), (3, 2)],
    (0, 3): [(1, 3)],
    (1, 3): [(0, 3), (2, 3)],
    (2, 3): [(1, 3), (3, 3)],
    (2, 0): [(1, 0), (3, 0)],
    (3, 0): [(2, 0), (3, 1)]
}
```

**Starting BFS**:
BFS path traversal starting from (0,0) to target (3,3):
- Start at (0,0)
- Visit neighbors sequentially and track visited paths.

After performing BFS, the shortest path found is laid out analyzing each move and making sure all moves continue using unvisited sections.

**Resulting Path**:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 
```
Here, each move from position to the next is connected based on the adjacency list, jumping from cell to cell until the target cell (3,3) is reached.
