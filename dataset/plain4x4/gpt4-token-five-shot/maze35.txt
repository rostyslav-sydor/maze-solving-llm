To solve the maze given by the adjacency list and find a path from the origin to the target, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS). Here's the structure of the current maze problem with the origin at (0,0) and the target at (3,3):

<ADJLIST_START> (2,2) <--> (1,2) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (0,1) <--> (1,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (1,1) <--> (2,1) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; <ADJLIST_END> 

Here's how to decode that adjacency list into a processable format:
- A list of connections indicates which nodes (cells) are directly connected to which.
- Use BFS starting from the origin, node (0,0), and seeking the target, node (3,3).

The decoded adjacency list into a graph is as follows (simplified understanding):
- Adjacent nodes: 
  - (0,0) <-> [(1,0), (0,1)]
  - (1,0) <-> [(0,0)]
  - (0,1) <-> [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1)]
  - (0,2) <-> [(0,1), (0,3)]
  - (0,3) <-> [(0,2), (1,3)]
  - ...

We would perform the BFS from (0,0) to find the shortest path to (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0), explore its neighbors: (1,0) and (0,1).
2. From (1,0), see (0,0) already explored.
3. From (0,1), explore (0,2); from (0,2), explore (0,3); then from (0,3) to (1,3).
4. From (1,3) leads to (2,3) because of the direct connection.
5. From (2,3) can access to (3,3).

Thus, the valid path in terms of coordinates from (0,0) to (3,3) based on BFS and available paths would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path represents a possible shortest connection from source to destination given the described graph connections.
