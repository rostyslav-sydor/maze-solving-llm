To find a solution to this maze represented by an adjacency list, we will first parse the adjacency list to create a graph and then use a pathfinding algorithm to determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

### Graph Creation ###
The graph can be created by treating each coordinate as a node and every connection as an undirected edge.

Here is the parsed adjacency list for the graph based on the provided adjacency list input:
```
(1,1) <-> (2,1)
(0,1) <-> (0,2)
(2,3) <-> (1,3)
(0,3) <-> (0,2)
(1,3) <-> (1,2)
(3,3) <-> (3,2)
(2,3) <-> (2,2)
(3,1) <-> (3,0)
(3,2) <-> (2,2)
(0,0) <-> (1,0)
(2,0) <-> (2,1)
(0,3) <-> (1,3)
(1,2) <-> (1,1)
(3,1) <-> (3,2)
(1,0) <-> (2,0)
```

### Using a Pathfinding Algorithm ###
A common algorithm for pathfinding in such graphs is Dijkstra's algorithm, but for small cases as the one shown above (4x4 grid), simpler algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be just as effective. We shall implement BFS here.

### BFS Implementation ###
We will start our BFS from the source coordinate (0,0) and explore all accessible nodes until we reach the target (3,3).

```python
from collections import deque

# Create the graph as adjacency list
maze_graph = {
    (0,0): {(1,0)},
    (1,0): {(2,0), (0,0)},
    (2,0): {(2,1), (1,0)},
    (2,1): {(2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (1,1)},
    (3,1): {(3,0), (3,2), (2,1)},
    (3,0): {(3,1)},
    (3,2): {(3,1), (3,3), (2,2)},
    (3,3): {(3,2)},
    (2,2): {(2,1), (2,3), (3,2)},
    (2,3): {(2,2), (1,3)},
    (1,3): {(1,2), (0,3), (2,3)},
    (1,2): {(1,1), (1,3)},
    (1,1): {(1,2), (2,1), (0,1)},
    (0,1): {(0,2), (1,1)},
    (0,2): {(0,1), (0,3)},
    (0,3): {(1,3), (0,2)}
}

# BFS to find the shortest path
def bfs(start, end):
    queue = deque([ (start, [start]) ])
    visited = set()
    
    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == end:
            return path
        
        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            
            for neighbor in maze_graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

# Set the origin and target
origin = (0,0)
target = (3,3)

# Find the path
path = bfs(origin, target)

# Print the path in the specified format
print("<PATH_START>", ' '.join(str(p) for p in path), "<PATH_END>")
```
This solution will compute and print the shortest path from the origin to the target in the given maze.
