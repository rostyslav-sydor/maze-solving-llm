To solve the last maze provided, we would need to construct the adjacency list and then utilize a path-finding algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

### Construction of Maze from Adjacency List
The adjacency list provided is presented in the following format:
```
<ADJLIST_START>
(1,3) <--> (0,3) ; 
(2,3) <--> (2,2) ; 
(2,0) <--> (3,0) ; 
(1,3) <--> (2,3) ; 
(2,1) <--> (1,1) ; 
(0,0) <--> (1,0) ; 
(1,1) <--> (1,2) ; 
(0,2) <--> (1,2) ; 
(3,3) <--> (3,2) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,2) ; 
(2,0) <--> (1,0) ; 
(0,0) <--> (0,1) ; 
(2,0) <--> (2,1) ; 
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ; 
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ;
<ADJLIST_END>
```

### Origin and Target Points:
```
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

### Path-finding:
Convert the adjacency list into a graph structure, then use BFS to find the shortest path considering the maze might exhibit multiple paths between the origin and destination. BFS is preferred for shortest path discovery in an unweighted graph, which is typical of a maze-like structure provided.

### BFS Approach:
1. Implement an adjacency map from the provided edges.
2. Start BFS traversal from node (0,0).
3. Track visited nodes and paths using a queue mechanism.
4. Upon reaching (3,3), conclude search and reconstruct path.

### Adjacency Mapping:
```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(1,0), (0,1)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)],
    (1,1): [(1,2), (2,1)],
    (1,2): [(1,1), (0,2)],
    (0,2): [(1,2), (0,3)],
    (0,3): [(1,3), (0,2)],
    (1,3): [(2,3), (0,3)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3), (2,2)],
    (3,3): [(2,3), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,0): [(2,0)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(2,0)],
    (2,2): [(2,3)]
}
```

### BFS Implementation:
Apply BFS here to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3).

### Example Path:
Using the created graph and applying BFS:
```python
visited = set() 
queue = [(0, 0, [(0,0)])] # (current node, path taken to reach node)
while queue:
    (x, y), path = queue.pop(0)
    if (x, y) == (3, 3):
        return path
    for (nx, ny) in graph[(x, y)]:
        if (nx, ny) not in visited:
            visited.add((nx, ny))
            queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
```
Resolve this pseudo-code to Python and execute to find the optimal path, then format it according to the request.

### Solution:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Note: The exact solution might differ slightly based on whether you choose DFS or BFS, and how exactly the adjacency list was understood and paths queued.
