To solve the maze provided in the last snippet, let's parse the adjacency list to determine connections between the nodes and find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Maze Adjacency List:**
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)

**Origin:**
- (0,0)

**Target:**
- (3,3)

**Building the Graph:**

The graph based on the adjacency list could be represented in Python with a dictionary, with keys being nodes and values being sets of connections:

```python
graph = {
    (0,0): [(1,0)],
    (1,0): [(2,0), (0,0)],
    (2,0): [(3,0), (1,0)],
    (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (2,1), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (3,1)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)],
    (2,1): [(1,1), (3,1)],
    (1,1): [(2,1), (1,0), (1,2)],
    (1,2): [(0,2), (2,2), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(1,2), (0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,2)],
    (2,3): [(3,3), (2,2), (1,3)],
    (2,2): [(2,3), (1,2)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3)]
}
```

**Finding the Path:**
We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

**BFS Code (hypothetical) in Python:**
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([[start]])
    visited = set([start])
    
    while queue:
        path = queue.popleft()
        node = path[-1]
        
        if node == end:
            return path
        
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                new_path = list(path)
                new_path.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(new_path)
              
    return []

# Assuming the above graph is built correctly and bfs_path is defined
path = bfs_path(graph, (0,0), (3,3))
```

**Expected Path for the given Maze:**
Based on the graph, the BFS search should ideally yield the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

However, this involves human validation, assuming a BFS implementation, and given the complexities of typos and assumptions in building the adjacency list.
