To solve the maze with given adjacency list representation, we have to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here is the detailed adjacency representation of the maze parsed from the given input:

Adjacency List:
- (3,0) ↔ (2,0); (1,2) ↔ (1,3); (3,0) ↔ (3,1); (1,3) ↔ (0,3); (0,2) ↔ (0,1); (0,1) ↔ (0,0); (2,3) ↔ (3,3); (1,1) ↔ (1,0); (2,2) ↔ (3,2); (2,1) ↔ (2,2); (1,2) ↔ (0,2); (2,1) ↔ (2,0); (1,3) ↔ (2,3); (3,3) ↔ (3,2); (1,0) ↔ (0,0).

Using this adjacency list, we can start exploring from the origin (0,0) and traverse the graph to find a path leading to (3,3). This can be achieved using search algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

I'll perform a BFS through the maze:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Explore neighbors: (0,1), (1,0)
3. From (0,1) explore: (0,2)
4. From (0,2) explore: (1,2)
5. From (1,2) explore: (0,2) [Already visited], (1,3)
6. From (1,3) explore: (0,3), (2,3)
7. From (0,3) explore: [Already visited]
8. From (2,3) explore: (3,3) [Target found]

Defining the path:
(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)

Thus the solution path for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
