To solve the given maze, we need to navigate from the start point `(0,0)` to the target point `(3,3)` based on the adjacency information provided in the `<ADJLIST_START>` token. I'll analyze the adjacency list to find a path:

- `(0,0)` connects to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`
- `(1,0)` connects to `(1,1)` and `(2,0)`
- `(1,1)` connects to `(1,2)`
- `(1,2)` connects to `(1,3)` and `(2,2)`
- `(1,3)` connects to `(0,3)` and `(2,3)`
- `(2,3)` connects to `(1,3)` and `(3,3)`
- `(2,2)` connects to `(2,3)` and `(2,1)`
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`
- `(0,2)` connects to `(0,3)`
- `(0,3)` connects to `(0,2)` and `(1,3)`
- `(2,1)` connects to `(2,2)` 
- `(3,1)` connects to `(3,0)` and `(3,2)`
- `(3,0)` connects to `(3,1)` and `(2,0)`
- `(3,2)` also connects to `(3,1)` and `(3,3)`
- `(3,3)` connects to `(3,2)` and `(2,3)`

To solve the maze, we traverse the available paths from the origin to the target:

1. Starting from `(0,0)`, move to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, move to `(0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, move to `(0,3)`.
4. Then, from `(0,3)`, move to `(1,3)`.
5. From `(1,3)`, move to `(2,3)`.
6. From `(2,3)`, proceed to the target at `(3,3)`.

Thus, the solution path is:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END>
