To solve the last described maze for a path from (0,0) to (3,3), I will process the adjacency list provided between the <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens, translate it into a usable graph format, and apply a graph search algorithm to find the solution. 

Understanding the connections in the adjacency list:

- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)

To solve the path from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Go from (0,0) to (1,0).
3. From (1,0) to (2,0).
4. From (2,0) to (2,1).
5. From (2,1) to (3,1).
6. From (3,1) to (3,2).
7. From (3,2) to (3,3).

The constructed path is possible based on the adjacency list, wherein connections between consecutive coordinates are ensured.

Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This solution appropriately finds a route through the maze, tracing connected paths from the origin to the target as specified in the adjacency list. It avoids cycles and obeys the graph connections as required.
