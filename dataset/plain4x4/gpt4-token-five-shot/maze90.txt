To solve the maze provided, you first need to convert the adjacency list into a graph representation. Then use a graph search algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Given Maze:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,1) <--> (1,0) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (1,1) <--> (2,1) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; <ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> 
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Converting the adjacency list:
1. (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0)
2. (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) and (0,2)
3. (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) and (0,3)
4. (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2)
5. (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) and (1,1)
6. (1,1) is adjacent to (1,0), (2,1), (1,2)
7. (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,3)
8. (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), (2,3)
9. (2,0) is connected to (3,0)
10. (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1), (2,2)
11. (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1), (2,3)
12. (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3), (3,3)
13. (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0), (3,1)
14. (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0), (3,2)
15. (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1), (3,3)
16. (3,3) is adjacent to (3,2), (2,3)

To solve, start at origin (0,0) and explore paths until (3,3) is reached:
1. From (0,0) to (1,0) (since connected directly)
2. To (1,1) (adjacent to (1,0))
3. To (1,2) (adjacent to (1,1))
4. To (1,3) (adjacent to (1,2))
5. To (2,3) (adjacent to (1,3))
6. To (3,3) (adjacent to (2,3))

Thus, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
