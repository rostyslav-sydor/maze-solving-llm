To solve the maze provided, we first need to parse the adjacency list and then use a graph traversal method to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Given your description of the Maze with adjacency list, let's parse it to understand the adjacent nodes.

**Adjacency List Information**
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(0,3) <--> (1,3) 
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(2,2) <--> (2,1)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
(2,2) <--> (2,3)
(1,1) <--> (1,0)
<ADJLIST_END>
```

From this, we can form a graph where vertices are nodes and edges represent paths between nodes. Let's find the path from (0,0) to (3,3) using a BFS for simpler implementation and clear pathfinding.

**Graph Representation (Edges)**
- (0,0) is linked to (1,0).
- (0,1) is linked to (0,2).
- (0,2) is linked to (1,2), and so forth as parsed from the adjacency list.

Now, let's perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the origin (0,0):

1. Start at (0,0) and explore its neighbors. From the adjacency list: 
   - Neighbor: (1,0)
2. From (1,0), explore its neighbors:
   - Neighbors: (0,0), (2,0), (1,1)
3. From (1,1), explore its neighbors:
   - Neighbors: (1,0), (1,2)
4. From (1,2), explore its neighbors:
   - Neighbors: (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2)
5. From (2,2), explore its neighbors:
   - Neighbors: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)
6. From (2,3), explore its neighbors:
   - Neighbors: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2)
7. Now at (2,3), directly reach the target (3,3).

**Solution Path**
```
<PATH_START>
(0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END>
```
This solution reflects a valid path through the maze using BFS based on the described adjacency relationships that satisfy reaching the target from the origin.
