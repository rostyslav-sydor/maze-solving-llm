To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, the goal is to trace a path from the specified origin (entry point) to the target (exit point) using the adjacency list to navigate from one node (point) to another such that each point is directly reachable as described. 

Given the adjacency list notation as described in your final question:

<ADJLIST_START> 
(3,1) <--> (3,0); 
(2,3) <--> (3,3); 
(0,0) <--> (0,1); 
(3,2) <--> (3,1); 
(0,1) <--> (1,1); 
(0,3) <--> (0,2); 
(3,2) <--> (3,3); 
(1,2) <--> (1,3); 
(2,0) <--> (2,1); 
(2,2) <--> (2,3); 
(3,0) <--> (2,0); 
(1,0) <--> (0,0); 
(2,2) <--> (1,2); 
(0,3) <--> (1,3); 
(2,1) <--> (1,1);
<ADJLIST_END> 
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Analyzing the adjacency structure, reconstruct the path:

1. Beginning at the origin (0,0).
2. Direct adjacency with (0,1).
3. From (0,1), go to (1,1).
4. From (1,1), we can move to (1,2) or (2,1). Moving directly toward the target, choose the path via (1,2) as it aligns vertically with the target coordinates.
5. From (1,2) move to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), move to (0,3).
7. From (0,3), move back to (0,2); however, (0,2) does not point directly towards our target along this path. We will re-route.
8. From (1,3), go directly to (2,3) since it has adjacency.
9. Finally, from (2,3), the target (3,3) is directly reachable.

So the correct path will be:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to this last maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
