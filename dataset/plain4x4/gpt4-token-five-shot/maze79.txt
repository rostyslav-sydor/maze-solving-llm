Given the adjacency list provided and the start and end points, we will construct the graph and then trace a path based on adjacency:

<ADJLIST_START>
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ;
(0,2) <--> (0,1) ;
(1,2) <--> (2,2) ;
(0,1) <--> (0,0) ;
(3,1) <--> (2,1) ;
(2,1) <--> (2,0) ;
(3,3) <--> (2,3) ;
(3,3) <--> (3,2) ;
(1,0) <--> (1,1) ;
(3,1) <--> (3,2) ;
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ;
(1,1) <--> (1,2) ;
(1,0) <--> (0,0) ;
(2,3) <--> (2,2) ;
(0,3) <--> (1,3) ; <ADJLIST_END>

<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> 
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

We can represent the maze as a graph where each coordinate pair `(r,c)` is a node, and each connection `(node1) <--> (node2)` is an undirected edge. We need to find a path from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 3)`.

Let's lay out the adjacency relationships based on the maze description:
- (3,1) connects to [(3,0), (2,1), (3,2)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (1,2) connects to [(2,2), (1,1)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,0), (3,1)]
- (3,3) connects to [(2,3), (3,2)]
- (1,0) connects to [(1,1), (0,0)]
- (2,2) connects to [(2,3), (1,2)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2), (1,3)]
- (1,1) connects to [(1,0), (1,2)]
   
We want to find a path that starts from (0,0) and ends at (3,3). A breadth-first search (BFS) is effective for such shortest path problems on an unweighted graph.

Path determination using BFS:
1. Start from (0,0)
2. Check neighbors [(0,1), (1,0)], select (0,1)
   - From (0,1), go to (0,2)
      - From (0,2) to (0,3)
        - From (0,3) to (1,3)
          - From (1,3) to (2,3)
            - From (2,3) to (2,2)
              - From (2,2) to (1,2)
                - From (1,2) to (3,2)
                  - From (3,2) to (3,3)

Resulting path:
<PATH_START> 
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) 
<PATH_END> 

Note: Given the connection generally a shortest or the most direct route is chosen for ease. Adjustments according to the adjacency list and the actual rendering of connections are valid as part of path adjustments during BFS execution.
