To find a solution for the maze described by the adjacency list, we need to identify a path that connects the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). To do this, we'll interpret the provided adjacency list and then perform a search (e.g., a breadth-first search) to find the shortest path.

The adjacency list for the maze is as follows:
(2,0) <--> (1,0) ;
(1,2) <--> (1,3) ;
(1,2) <--> (1,1) ;
(0,1) <--> (0,2) ;
(1,3) <--> (0,3) ;
(2,0) <--> (3,0) ;
(0,3) <--> (0,2) ;
(3,1) <--> (2,1) ;
(2,3) <--> (2,2) ;
(3,2) <--> (2,2) ;
(0,0) <--> (0,1) ;
(3,2) <--> (3,3) ;
(3,0) <--> (3,1) ;
(2,3) <--> (1,3) ;
(2,1) <--> (1,1) ;

We need to traverse this graph from (0,0) to (3,3). Now let's construct a path from the origin to the destination using the given adjacency information.

- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) (connected directly)
- Move to (0,2) (connected to (0,1))
- Move to (0,3) (connected to (0,2))
- Move to (1,3) (since (0,3) is connected to (1,3))
- Move to (2,3) (since (1,3) is connected to (2,3))
- Move to (3,3) (since (2,3) is connected to (3,3))

By following this path, we construct the solution for the maze:

Solution:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This establishes a direct route from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
