To solve this maze, represented as an adjacency list, and find a path from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. First, we'll parse the adjacency list to understand how the nodes (positions) in the maze are connected.

From the input `<ADJLIST_START>...<ADJLIST_END>`, the connections represented are:
```
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (3,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(0,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(0,2) <--> (0,1)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(3,0) <--> (2,0)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(1,2) <--> (1,1)
```

2. Representing the adjacency list as a graph in Python visualization:
```python
graph = {
  (0,0): [(1,0), (0,1)],
  (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)],
  (3,1): [(3,0), (2,1), (3,2)],
  (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)],
  (0,3): [(1,3)],
  (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3), (1,2)],
  (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)],
  (0,2): [(1,2), (0,1)],
  (0,1): [(0,2), (0,0)],
  (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
  (1,2): [(0,2), (1,3), (1,1)],
  (2,1): [(3,1), (2,2)],
  (2,2): [(2,1)],
  (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0)],
  (1,1): [(1,2)]
}
```

3. Find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS):
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target, graph):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    parent = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        if node == target:
            break
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                parent[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Reconstruct path from parent pointers
    path = []
    step = target
    while step is not None:
        path.append(step)
        step = parent[step]
    path.reverse()
    return path

# Calculate path for the maze
start = (0, 0)
target = (3, 3)
path = bfs(start, target, graph)

# Print the path
print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(str(p) for p in path), "<PATH_END>")
```

Plugging in this pseudocode and logic to find the path results in:
  
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 
```
