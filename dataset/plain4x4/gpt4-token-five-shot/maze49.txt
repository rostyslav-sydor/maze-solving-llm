To solve the maze described in your last input, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Extract the adjacency information and parse it into a usable data structure (like a dictionary or graph).**
2. **Identify the origin (starting point) and the target (ending point).**
3. **Use a search algorithm to find a path from the origin to the target.**

Given that the maze and locations are:

```
<ADJLIST_START>
(1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ;
(3,2) <--> (2,2) ; (0,1) <--> (0,2) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ;
(2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ;
<ADJLIST_END>
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

Let's convert this to an adjacency list:
- Each node corresponds to a coordinate and each edge suggests direct connectivity.
  
Create the adjacency graph:
```python
graph = {
    (0, 0): [(1, 0)],
    (1, 0): [(0, 0), (2, 0)],
    (2, 0): [(3, 0), (1, 0)],
    (3, 0): [(3, 1), (2, 0)],
    (3, 1): [(3, 0), (2, 1)],
    (2, 1): [(3, 1), (1,1)],
    (1, 1): [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)],
    (0, 1): [(0, 2), (1, 1)],
    (0, 2): [(0, 1), (0, 3)],
    (0, 3): [(1, 3), (0, 2)],
    (1, 3): [(2, 3), (0, 3)],
    (2, 3): [(1, 3), (3, 3)],
    (3, 3): [(3, 2)],
    (3, 2): [(3, 3), (2, 2)],
    (2, 2): [(3, 2)],
    (1, 2): [(1, 1)]
}

start = (0, 0)
end = (3, 3)
```

To solve the maze, we'd likely use a BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm which is well-suited for shortest path finding in unweighted graphs:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([start])
    came_from = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == end:
            break
        
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in came_from:
                came_from[neighbor] = current
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    if current != end:
        return None  # No path
    
    # Reconstruct path
    path = []
    while current:
        path.append(current)
        current = came_from[current]
    path.reverse()
    
    return path

# Calculate the path
path_solution = bfs_path(graph, start, end)
```

The solution for the provided graph structure is represented as:
```
if path_solution:
    print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(str(p) for p in path_solution), "<PATH_END>")
```

Based on this approach, here is the answer (output as if the Python algorithm was executed):
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path navigates through the adjacency list defined, utilizing the BFS to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3).
