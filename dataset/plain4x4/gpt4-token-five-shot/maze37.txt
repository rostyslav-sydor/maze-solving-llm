To solve the given maze from the adjacency list, we need to use graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from the origin to the target. Here, the adjacency list defines the valid moves between maze cells. I'll adopt BFS for its ability to find the shortest path.

Let's break down the provided maze adjacency list first and search the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:

**Adjacency List of the Maze:**
```
(2,0) <--> (2,1); 
(3,2) <--> (3,3); 
(2,3) <--> (1,3); 
(3,0) <--> (3,1); 
(2,2) <--> (3,2); 
(0,1) <--> (0,0); 
(0,3) <--> (1,3); 
(0,0) <--> (1,0); 
(2,2) <--> (2,3); 
(1,2) <--> (2,2); 
(1,1) <--> (1,0); 
(0,2) <--> (0,3); 
(3,1) <--> (3,2); 
(0,2) <--> (0,1); 
(3,0) <--> (2,0);
```

**Adjacency Mapping (Parsed for Traversing):**
- `(0,0)` connects to `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`
- `(1,0)` connects to `(0,0)`, `(1,1)`
- `(2,0)` connects to `(3,0)`, `(2,1)`
- `(3,0)` connects to `(3,1)`, `(2,0)`
- `(0,1)` connects to `(0,0)`, `(0,2)`
- `(1,1)` connects to `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`
- `(0,2)` connects to `(0,3)`, `(0,1)`
- `(0,3)` connects to `(0,2)`, `(1,3)`
- `(1,2)` connects to `(1,1)`, `(2,2)`
- `(2,1)` connects to `(2,0)`
- `(2,2)` connects to `(3,2)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,3)`
- `(3,1)` connects to `(3,0)`, `(3,2)`
- `(1,3)` connects to `(0,3)`, `(2,3)`
- `(3,2)` connects to `(3,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,3)`
- `(2,3)` connects to `(1,3)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,3)`
- `(3,3)` connects to `(2,3)`, `(3,2)`

Initiating BFS from `(0,0)` to find a path to `(3,3)`:

1. Begin at `(0,0)`, enqueued neighbors: `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`
2. Visit `(0,1)`, enqueued neighbor: `(0,2)`
3. Visit `(1,0)`, enqueued neighbor: `(1,1)`
4. Visit `(0,2)`, enqueued neighbor: `(0,3)`
5. Visit `(1,1)`, enqueued neighbor: `(1,2)`
6. Visit `(0,3)`, enqueued neighbor: `(1,3)`
7. Visit `(1,2)`, enqueued neighbor: `(2,2)`
8. Visit `(1,3)`, enqueued neighbors: `(2,3)`
9. Visit `(2,2)`, enqueued neighbors: `(3,2)`
10. Visit `(2,3)`, enqueued neighbor: `(3,3)`
11. Visit `(3,2)`, enqueued neighbors: null since `(3,3)` has already been queued and will terminate next as the goal

Complete the path sequence:
`(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)`

**Solution for the maze**:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path represents the discovered sequence using BFS from the origin to the destination that satisfies connectivity as defined by the adjacency list.
