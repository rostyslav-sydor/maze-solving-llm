To solve this maze, we need to determine the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list given. To do this, we can employ a simple pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited to unweighted graphs like this maze. Letâ€™s outline the paths possible based on the adjacency list:

Given adjacency list:
```
<ADJLIST_START> 
(0,3) <--> (1,3); 
(3,2) <--> (3,1); 
(2,1) <--> (2,0); 
(1,0) <--> (0,0); 
(3,0) <--> (3,1); 
(2,3) <--> (2,2); 
(3,3) <--> (3,2); 
(0,3) <--> (0,2); 
(3,0) <--> (2,0); 
(1,3) <--> (2,3); 
(3,3) <--> (2,3); 
(0,1) <--> (0,2); 
(1,1) <--> (2,1); 
(1,1) <--> (1,2); 
(0,1) <--> (0,0); 
<ADJLIST_END>
```

We translate this into neighbors for each cell in the maze:
- (0,0) connects with [(1,0), (0,1)]
- (0,1) connects with [(0,0), (0,2)]
- (0,2) connects with [(0,1), (0,3)]
- (0,3) connects with [(0,2), (1,3)]
- (1,0) connects with [(0,0)]
- (1,1) connects with [(2,1), (1,2)]
- (1,2) connects with [(1,1)]
- (1,3) connects with [(2,3), (0,3)]
- (2,0) connects with [(3,0), (2,1)]
- (2,1) connects with [(1,1), (2,0)]
- (2,2) connects with [(2,3)]
- (2,3) connects with [(3,3), (2,2), (1,3)]
- (3,0) connects with [(3,1), (2,0)]
- (3,1) connects with [(3,0), (3,2)]
- (3,2) connects with [(3,1), (3,3)]
- (3,3) connects with [(3,2), (2,3)]

Using BFS starting from (0,0):

1. Explore all neighbors of (0,0), which include (1,0) and (0,1). Queue: [(1,0), (0,1)]
2. From (1,0), next we can move to previously unvisited nodes - Queue: [(0,1)]
3. From (0,1), explore (0,2) since it's connected - Queue: [(0,2)]
4. From (0,2), explore (0,3) since it's connected - Queue: [(0,3)]
5. From (0,3), go to (1,3) - Queue: [(1,3)]
6. From (1,3), connect to (2,3) - Queue: [(2,3)]
7. Finally, from (2,3), reach the target at (3,3) - Goal achieved.

Following this path, we can construct the solution as:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path effectively traces the route across the maze from the top left corner to the bottom right corner completing the search.
