To solve this maze, we will begin by parsing the adjacency list given in the description and subsequently determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Here's the adjacency list representation converted into edges:
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)

From this adjacency list, you can construct the graph and use a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here's a proposed BFS solution:

1. Initialize the BFS with the origin (0,0).
2. Explore the neighbours based on the connections:
   - From (0,0), we can go to (0,1) (down) or to (1,0) (right).
3. Continue the exploration from each new node until you reach the target (3,3).
4. Make sure to keep track of visited nodes to avoid circular paths.

After constructing and analyzing the path from (0,0) to (3,3), and taking the most direct and available paths from the adjacency list, the plausible BFS-derived path is:

**Path**: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the solution for this particular maze presented in the list is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This ordered sequence of coordinates effectively navigates through the maze from the start to the finish by using all available node connections provided.
