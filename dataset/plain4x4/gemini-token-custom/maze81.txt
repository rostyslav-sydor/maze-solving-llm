<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is a valid solution because:

- It starts at the origin and ends at the target.
- It only uses adjacent cells.
- It does not cross any walls.

To find this solution, we can use a depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithm. Starting at the origin, we can explore all of the adjacent cells until we reach the target. We can then backtrack to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.
