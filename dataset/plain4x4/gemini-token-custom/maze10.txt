<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

- Start from the origin point (0,0) and move right until you hit a wall.
- Turn down and move down until you hit a wall.
- Turn right and move right until you hit a wall.
- Turn down and move down until you hit a wall.
- Turn right and move right until you hit the target point (3,3).

**Checking the solution:**

- The path does not cross any walls.
- The path uses only adjacent cells.
