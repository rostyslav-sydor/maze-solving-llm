<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
- Start from the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
- Move down to (1,1) and continue moving right to (2,1).
- Move down again to (3,1) and finally move right to the target (3,3).

**Checking the solution:**
- No walls are crossed because the path follows the edges of the maze.
- All cells in the path are adjacent to each other.
