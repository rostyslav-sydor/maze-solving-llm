Reasoning:
- The entry point is at cell (0,0) and the exit point is at cell (3,3).
- The path must always move in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right).
- The path cannot cross any walls.
- The path must use only adjacent cells.

Based on these constraints, the following path can be found:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path satisfies all of the constraints:
- It starts at the entry point and ends at the exit point.
- It always moves in one of the four cardinal directions.
- It does not cross any walls.
- It uses only adjacent cells.
