<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Let's start from the origin and move towards the target.

- We start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1).
- From (0,1), we can either move up to (0,0) or right to (0,2). We move right to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can either move up to (0,1) or right to (0,3). We move right to (0,3).
- From (0,3), we can either move up to (0,2) or right to (1,3). We move right to (1,3).
- From (1,3), we can either move down to (0,3) or right to (2,3). We move right to (2,3).
- From (2,3), we can either move down to (1,3) or right to (3,3). We move right to (3,3).

We have reached the target at (3,3).

Let's check if our solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.

- We start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1). There is no wall between (0,0) and (0,1), so this move is valid.
- We move right to (0,2). There is no wall between (0,1) and (0,2), so this move is valid.
- We move right to (0,3). There is no wall between (0,2) and (0,3), so this move is valid.
- We move right to (1,3). There is no wall between (0,3) and (1,3), so this move is valid.
- We move right to (2,3). There is no wall between (1,3) and (2,3), so this move is valid.
- We move right to (3,3). There is no wall between (2,3) and (3,3), so this move is valid.

All of the moves in our solution are valid, so our solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
