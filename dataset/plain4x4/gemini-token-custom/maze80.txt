From the entrance <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) there are two possible moves:
- first move to (1,0)
- first move to (0,1)

Let's try the first move: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path leads to the exit <TARGET_START> (3,3), so it is a solution.

To check if the solution does not cross any walls, we can check if each pair of adjacent coordinates in the path are connected by an edge in the adjacency list.

(0,0) -> (1,0)
(1,0) -> (1,1)
(1,1) -> (1,2)
(1,2) -> (1,3)
(1,3) -> (2,3)
(2,3) -> (3,3)

All these pairs of coordinates are connected by an edge in the adjacency list, so the path does not cross any walls.

To check if the path uses only adjacent cells, we can check if the difference between the row coordinates of each pair of adjacent coordinates is at most 1 and the difference between the column coordinates of each pair of adjacent coordinates is at most 1.

(0,0) -> (1,0): row difference is 1, column difference is 0
(1,0) -> (1,1): row difference is 0, column difference is 1
(1,1) -> (1,2): row difference is 0, column difference is 1
(1,2) -> (1,3): row difference is 0, column difference is 1
(1,3) -> (2,3): row difference is 1, column difference is 0
(2,3) -> (3,3): row difference is 1, column difference is 0

All these pairs of coordinates have a row difference of at most 1 and a column difference of at most 1, so the path uses only adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution path is valid.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
