<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

We start at the origin (0,0) and follow the path until we reach the target (3,3).

1. We start at (0,0) and move right to (0,1).
2. We move down to (0,2).
3. We move right to (0,3).
4. We move up to (1,3).
5. We move right to (2,3).
6. We move up to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking the solution:**

* The solution does not cross any walls.
* The path uses only adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution is valid.
