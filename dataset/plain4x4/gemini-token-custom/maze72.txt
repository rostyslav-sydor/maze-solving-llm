Starting from <ORIGIN_START> at (0,0), the possible moves are (0,1) and (1,0). 
Going to (0,1), the possible moves are (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1). 
If we go to (0,2), the only move from there is (0,1), so that is a dead end. 
Going to (1,1), the possible moves are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,2). 
If we go to (1,2), the only move from there is (1,1), so that is also a dead end. 
Therefore, from (0,0), the only valid move is (1,0).

From (1,0), the possible moves are (0,0), (1,1), and (2,0). 
We have already explored (0,0) and (1,1), so the only remaining valid move is (2,0).

From (2,0), the possible moves are (1,0) and (2,1). 
We have already explored (1,0), so the only remaining valid move is (2,1).

From (2,1), the possible moves are (1,1), (2,0), and (2,2). 
We have already explored (1,1) and (2,0), so the only remaining valid move is (2,2).

From (2,2), the possible moves are (1,2), (2,1), and (2,3). 
We have already explored (1,2) and (2,1), so the only remaining valid move is (2,3).

From (2,3), the possible moves are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,3). 
We have already explored (1,3) and (2,2), so the only remaining valid move is (3,3), which is the <TARGET_END> token.

Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Checking the path, all moves are between adjacent cells and the path does not cross any walls.
