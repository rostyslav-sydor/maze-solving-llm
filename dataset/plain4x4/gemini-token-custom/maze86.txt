From the starting point at (0,0), we can move either right to (0,1) or down to (1,0).
Moving right to (0,1), we can then move down to (1,1).
From (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1).
Moving right to (1,2), we can then move down to (2,2).
From (2,2), we can move right to (2,3) or up to (1,2).
Moving right to (2,3), we reach the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

All the moves are valid as they are either right or down moves and there are no walls between the cells.
