The adjacency list is a representation of the maze's grid, with each cell represented by a pair of coordinates (row, column) and each edge by a pair of cells.
The starting and ending points are marked with special tokens, and the list of edges is sorted by the first coordinate of the starting cell to facilitate the search.
In order to solve the maze, depth-first search can be applied, starting at the starting point, and following the edges until the end point is reached.
The following path is a solution for this maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells, as it follows the edges of the graph.
