<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

- Starting from the origin (0,0) move right once to (0,1).
- From (0,1), move down to (1,1).
- From (1,1) move right twice to (1,3).
- From (1,3) move down to (2,3)
- From (2,3) move right once to (3,3).
- This is the target location so we stop here.

This path does not cross any walls, because we only move right and down, which are the only allowed directions in the maze.
Additionally, we only move to adjacent cells, since each move is either one cell right or one cell down.
