<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
* Start at the origin (0,0).
* Follow the path to the north (0,1), then east (0,2).
* Turn south (1,2), then east (2,2).
* Turn south (2,3), then east (3,3) to reach the target.

**Check:**
* The path does not cross any walls.
* Each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell.
