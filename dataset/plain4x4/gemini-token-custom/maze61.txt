<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1).
3. Continue moving right to (1,2), then up to (1,3).
4. This path leads to the target point (3,3).

**Verification:**

* The path does not cross any walls, as it only moves between adjacent cells.
* The path uses only adjacent cells, as each move is either one space to the right or one space up.
