Starting at the <ORIGIN_START> token (0,0), we can move to (0,1) by following the adjacency list. From (0,1) we can move to (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), and finally to the <TARGET_END> token (3,3). Therefore, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We can verify that this path is valid by checking that each move is to an adjacent cell. For example, the move from (0,0) to (0,1) is valid because (0,1) is in the adjacency list of (0,0). Similarly, the move from (1,3) to (3,3) is valid because (3,3) is in the adjacency list of (1,3). We can also verify that the path does not cross any walls. For example, there is no edge between (0,0) and (1,0), so the path does not cross the wall between these two cells.
