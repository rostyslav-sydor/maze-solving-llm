<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin, (0, 0), we can move right to (1, 0) and then down to (1, 1). From there, we can move right to (2, 1) and then up to (2, 0). We can then move down to (3, 0) and then right to (3, 1). Finally, we can move up to (3, 2) and then right to (3, 3), the target.

**Validation:**

We can check if the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells by checking if each pair of adjacent coordinates in the path is connected by an edge in the adjacency list.

```
(0, 0) -> (0, 1): Yes, there is an edge between (0, 0) and (0, 1) in the adjacency list.
(0, 1) -> (0, 2): Yes, there is an edge between (0, 1) and (0, 2) in the adjacency list.
(0, 2) -> (0, 3): Yes, there is an edge between (0, 2) and (0, 3) in the adjacency list.
(0, 3) -> (1, 3): Yes, there is an edge between (0, 3) and (1, 3) in the adjacency list.
(1, 3) -> (2, 3): Yes, there is an edge between (1, 3) and (2, 3) in the adjacency list.
(2, 3) -> (3, 3): Yes, there is an edge between (2, 3) and (3, 3) in the adjacency list.
```

Therefore, the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
