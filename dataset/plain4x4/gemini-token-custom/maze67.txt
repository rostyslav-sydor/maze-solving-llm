<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning**:  
- Start from the origin cell at (0,0) and move right to (1,0)
- From (1,0), move down to (1,1) as it is the only adjacent cell not visited yet
- From (1,1), move right to (2,1) as it is the only adjacent cell not visited yet
- From (2,1), move down to (3,1) as it is the only adjacent cell not visited yet
- From (3,1), move right to (3,2) as it is the only adjacent cell not visited yet
- From (3,2), move up to (3,3) which is the target cell

**Verification**: 
- The path does not cross any walls as all the moves are between adjacent cells
- The path uses only adjacent cells as all the moves are between cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent
