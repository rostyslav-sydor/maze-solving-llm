<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning: The path starts at the entry point (0,0), moves right to (0,1), then up to (1,1), right to (1,2), right to (1,3), down to (2,3), and finally right to the exit point (3,3).

Checking for validity:
- None of the steps move through a wall (i.e., there is an edge between each pair of adjacent cells in the path).
- Each step moves to an adjacent cell (i.e., the difference between the row or column indices of adjacent cells in the path is always 1).
