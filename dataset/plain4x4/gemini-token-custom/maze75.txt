**Solution:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. Starting from the starting point <ORIGIN_START>, we see that there are only two possible paths: (1,0) and (0,1). We choose the path (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can only go to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), we can go to (1,2) or (0,1). We choose the path (1,2).
4. From (1,2), we can go to (1,3) or (0,2). We choose the path (1,3).
5. From (1,3), we can only go to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), we can only go to (3,3).

This path satisfies all the requirements of the problem:
- It starts at the starting point and ends at the target point.
- It uses only adjacent cells.
- It does not cross any walls.

**Verification:**
We can check that the path does not cross any walls by checking that each pair of adjacent cells in the path are connected by an edge in the adjacency list. For example, the cells (1,0) and (1,1) are connected by an edge, as are the cells (1,1) and (1,2). We can also check that the path uses only adjacent cells by checking that each pair of adjacent cells in the path differ by at most 1 in either row or column. For example, the cells (1,0) and (1,1) differ by 1 in row, and the cells (1,1) and (1,2) differ by 1 in column. Therefore, the path is valid.
