<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1). From there, we have two options: move up to (1,1) or continue right to (0,2). We choose to move right, and then up to (1,2). From there, we have two options: move up to (2,2) or continue right to (1,3). We choose to move right, and then up to (2,3). From there, we have two options: move up to (3,3) or continue right to (2,4). We choose to move up to (3,3), which is our target.

**Check:**

We can check that our solution does not cross any walls by making sure that each move is to an adjacent cell. We can also check that the path uses only adjacent cells by making sure that there are no jumps in the path. Both of these checks pass, so our solution is valid.
