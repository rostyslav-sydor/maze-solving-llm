**Solution:**

1. Start at the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0).
3. Move down to (2,0).
4. Move right to (3,0).
5. Move up to (3,1).
6. Move right to (3,2).
7. Move down to (3,3) <TARGET_END>.

**Reasoning:**

* The path starts at the origin and moves towards the target.
* At each step, the path chooses the adjacent cell that is closer to the target.
* The path does not cross any walls because it only moves to adjacent cells.
* The path does not revisit any cells because it moves in a single direction at each step.

**Verification:**

To verify that the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells, we can check each step of the path.

1. The move from (0,0) to (1,0) is a horizontal move, which is allowed.
2. The move from (1,0) to (2,0) is a vertical move, which is allowed.
3. The move from (2,0) to (3,0) is a horizontal move, which is allowed.
4. The move from (3,0) to (3,1) is a vertical move, which is allowed.
5. The move from (3,1) to (3,2) is a horizontal move, which is allowed.
6. The move from (3,2) to (3,3) is a vertical move, which is allowed.

Therefore, the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells.
