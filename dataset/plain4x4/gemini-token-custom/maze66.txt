This is a simple maze with a direct path leading from the start to the exit. The path is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Let's check if this path is valid:

- The path starts at the start coordinate (0,0).
- Each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell.
- The path stays within the boundaries of the maze.
- The path ends at the exit coordinate (3,3).

Therefore, this path is a valid solution to the maze.
