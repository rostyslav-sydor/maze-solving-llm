<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Move right to (0,1).
3. Move down to (0,2).
4. Move right to (1,2).
5. Move down to (2,2).
6. Move right to (3,2).
7. Move up to (3,3).
8. You have reached the target (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls and only uses adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution to the maze.
