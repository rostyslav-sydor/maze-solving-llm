<PATH_START> (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
Starting from the target, we need to find a path to the origin. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the maze. Starting from (3,3), we can move to (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), and finally (0,0). This path does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution.
