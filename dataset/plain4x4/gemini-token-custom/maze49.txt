<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
- Start from the origin (0,0) and move towards the target (3,3)
- For each step, check the available adjacent cells and move to the cell that is closer to the target
- Repeat the process until the target is reached

Checking if the solution is valid:
- The path does not cross any walls because it only moves to adjacent cells
- The path uses only adjacent cells because it only moves to cells that are connected to the current cell
