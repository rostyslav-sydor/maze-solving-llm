To find the solution for the maze, we can use a depth-first search. We start at the origin point and follow the paths until we reach the target point.

Here is the solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**
1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Follow the path to the right until you reach the end of the row.
3. Go down one row and follow the path to the right until you reach the end of the row.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the target point (3,3).

**Check:**
The solution does not cross any walls because it only follows the paths. The path uses only adjacent cells because it only moves one cell in the horizontal or vertical direction at a time.
