<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin at (0,0), we move right to (1,0) and then down to (2,0), following the path specified by the adjacency list. From (2,0), we move right to (3,0), up to (3,1), and then right to (3,2). Finally, we move up to (3,3) to reach the target.

**Checking if the solution is valid:**

1. No walls crossed: The solution never moves from one cell to another that is not adjacent in the adjacency list, so no walls are crossed.
2. Only adjacent cells used: The solution only moves between cells that are adjacent in the adjacency list, so only adjacent cells are used.

Therefore, the solution is valid.
