<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Chain of thought:**

We can solve the maze by starting from the origin and traversing the maze until we reach the target. We can start by moving right until we reach a wall and then move down one cell. Then we can move right again until we reach another wall and then move down again. We can continue this process until we reach the target.

**Verification:**

We can check that the solution does not cross any walls by ensuring that each move is to an adjacent cell. We can also check that the path uses only adjacent cells by ensuring that each move is to a cell that is either directly above, below, left, or right of the current cell.

The provided solution does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution to the maze.
