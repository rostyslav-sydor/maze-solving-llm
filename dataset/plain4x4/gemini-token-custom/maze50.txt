<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution starts at the origin (0,0), moves right to (0,1), then up to (0,2), then right to (0,3), then up to (1,3), then right to (2,3), and finally up to the target (3,3).

Checking if the solution does not cross any walls:

- The move from (0,0) to (0,1) is valid because there is an edge between (0,0) and (0,1).
- The move from (0,1) to (0,2) is valid because there is an edge between (0,1) and (0,2).
- The move from (0,2) to (0,3) is valid because there is an edge between (0,2) and (0,3).
- The move from (0,3) to (1,3) is valid because there is an edge between (0,3) and (1,3).
- The move from (1,3) to (2,3) is valid because there is an edge between (1,3) and (2,3).
- The move from (2,3) to (3,3) is valid because there is an edge between (2,3) and (3,3).

Checking if the path uses only adjacent cells:

- The move from (0,0) to (0,1) is valid because (0,0) and (0,1) are adjacent cells.
- The move from (0,1) to (0,2) is valid because (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent cells.
- The move from (0,2) to (0,3) is valid because (0,2) and (0,3) are adjacent cells.
- The move from (0,3) to (1,3) is valid because (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent cells.
- The move from (1,3) to (2,3) is valid because (1,3) and (2,3) are adjacent cells.
- The move from (2,3) to (3,3) is valid because (2,3) and (3,3) are adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution is valid.
