**Solution:** <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

* We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1).
* We then move right again to (0,2).
* We continue moving right to (0,3).
* We then move up to (1,3).
* We continue moving up to (1,2).
* We then move up again to (1,1).
* We continue moving up to (2,1).
* We then move right to (2,2).
* We continue moving right to (3,2).
* We then move up to (3,3), which is the target.

**Checking the Solution:**

* The solution does not cross any walls because each move is either right or up, and there is no wall between any of the cells in the path.
* The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is either right or up, and the cells in the path are all adjacent to each other.
