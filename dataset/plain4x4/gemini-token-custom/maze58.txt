<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move right one step to (0,1).
3. Move right one step to (0,2).
4. Move up one step to (1,2).
5. Move right one step to (1,3).
6. Move up one step to (2,3).
7. Move right one step to (3,3). This is the target.

**Checking for validity:**

1. The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3).
2. Each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell.
3. The path does not cross any walls.

Therefore, the path is a valid solution to the maze.
