<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

** Reasoning:**
- Starting from the <ORIGIN_START> at (0,0), we move right to (0,1) and then continue until we reach (0,3).
- From (0,3), we move up to (1,3).
- Then, we move right to (2,3), and finally up to (3,3) which is the <TARGET_END>.

** Checking for solution correctness:**

- No walls are crossed because the path follows the edges of the adjacency list.
- All cells in the path are adjacent to each other.
