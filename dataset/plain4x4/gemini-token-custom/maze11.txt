<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution starts at the origin (0,0) and moves east one step to (0,1). 
From there, it continues east to (0,2), then north to (0,3), then east to (1,3), then north to (2,3), and finally east to the target (3,3).

This solution is valid because it does not cross any walls and each step is to an adjacent cell.
