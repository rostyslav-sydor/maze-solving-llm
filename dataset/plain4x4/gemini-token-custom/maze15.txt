To solve the maze, we use depth first search algorithm. 
We start in the cell (0,0) which is marked with <ORIGIN_START> token, and recursively check all its neighbours. For each neighbour, we check if it has been visited before, and if not, we call the function on that neighbour.
We continue the process until we reach the cell (3,3) which is marked with <TARGET_END> token. 

Along the way, we store the path from the starting cell to the current cell in a list.
When we reach the goal cell, we return the list of cells in the path from the starting cell to the goal cell.

In this case, the path from the starting cell (0,0) to the goal cell (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To check if the solution does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells, we compare the current cell with all four neighbours (left, right, up, down). If a current cell is (x,y), then neighbours are (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), (x, y+1). If any of neighbours coincides with the current cell in the maze, then they are adjacent. 

In this case, all cells in the path are adjacent, and the path does not cross any walls.
