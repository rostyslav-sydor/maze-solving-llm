<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1), then down to (0,2), then right to (0,3), then up to (1,3), then right to (2,3), and finally down to (3,3), which is the target.

This path does not cross any walls because each move is to an adjacent cell. We can see this by checking the adjacency list:

- (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1)
- (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2)
- (0,2) is adjacent to (0,3)
- (0,3) is adjacent to (1,3)
- (1,3) is adjacent to (2,3)
- (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3)

We can also see that the path uses only adjacent cells by checking that each move is to a cell that is either directly above, below, left, or right of the current cell.
