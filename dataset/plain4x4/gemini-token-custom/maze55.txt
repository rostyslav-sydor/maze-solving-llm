The path starts at (0,0) and goes right to (1,0), then down to (1,1), then right to (1,2), then down to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then down to (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls because it only moves right or down, and it does not use any diagonal cells.

This path uses only adjacent cells because each cell is adjacent to the previous cell.
