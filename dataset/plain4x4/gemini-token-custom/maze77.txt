**SOLUTION**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>


**SOLUTION REASONING**

To start with, find all the coordinates in a maze represented as an adjacency list. 

Next is to identify starting coordinates by looking for a <ORIGIN_START> token, followed by <ORIGIN_END> token to identify ending coordinates and a <TARGET_END> token to identify exit coordinates.

For this example, starting coordinate would be (0,0), exit coordinates would be (3,3). 

Starting from starting coordinate, find all adjacent coordinates and select a coordinate which is not yet in a path. 
In the first iteration, this would be (0,1) because (1,0) is already in the path. 

Follow this same logic and select adjacent coordinate which does not intersect a wall, and is not yet part of the defined maze. 
The selected adjacent coordinates should also not be an existing path. 

For this maze, the only valid path would be (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).

**SOLUTION VALIDATION**

1. Selected adjacent nodes are part of the initial graph, therefore they are valid nodes for traversal and is guaranteed to not run into any walls.


2. Selected path does not cross any walls, because all the selected coordinates do not have walls around it.


3. Selected paths use only adjacent nodes, that can be seen from an adjacent list, every next node is either right or down adjacent to its previous one. 

**CONCLUSION**

Therefore the provided solution is the shortest valid path for provided maze definition above.
