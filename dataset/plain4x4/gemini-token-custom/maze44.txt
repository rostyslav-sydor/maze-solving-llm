<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from the `(0,0)` coordinate, we can move down to `(0,1)` based on the adjacency list provided. From there, we can move right to `(0,2)` and then down again to `(0,3)`. Next, we can move right to `(1,3)` and then up to `(2,3)`. Finally, we can move right to `(3,3)`, which is the target coordinate.

It is important to note that this solution does not cross any walls, as it only uses adjacent cells and does not move through any walls.
