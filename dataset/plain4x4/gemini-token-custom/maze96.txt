<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution traverses the maze following the right wall (the wall to the right of the path) and ensures that it does not hit any dead ends or revisit any cells.
It follows the right wall all the way until it reaches the target.

Let’s go through the path to check if it does not cross any walls and path uses only adjacent cells:

- Starting from origin (0,0), it first moves right to get to (0,1)
- At (0,1), it can’t move right as its a dead end, so it moves down to get to (0,2)
- At (0,2), it can’t move right because it would cross a wall, so it continues to move down to get to (0,3)
- From (0,3), it can finally move right and gets to (1,3)
- At (1,3), it can’t move right since that would cross a wall, so it moves up to get to (0,3)
- From (0,3), it continues right to get to (1,3) again (since its right wall following path)
- From (1,3), it can finally move right and get to (2,3)
- It continues following the right wall from (2,3) to (3,3), which is target location

Thus, all cells in the path are adjacent and do not cross any walls.
