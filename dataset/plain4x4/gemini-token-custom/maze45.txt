First let's find the path from the starting point to the exit point.

Start at the origin point (0,0) and go right to (1,0), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then up to (2,0), then right to (3,0), then up to (3,1), then right to (3,2), then up to (3,3), which is the target point.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Now let's check if the path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.

The path does not cross any walls because it only moves right, left, up, or down, which are the only directions allowed in the maze.

The path uses only adjacent cells because each move is to a cell that is either to the right, left, up, or down of the current cell.

Therefore, the path is a valid solution to the maze.
