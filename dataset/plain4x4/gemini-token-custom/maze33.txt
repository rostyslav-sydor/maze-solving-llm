<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We chose the path above by first selecting an entry point. It must be one of the tokens marked with <ORIGIN_START/END>. Since we can choose any one of them we picked (0, 0).

From the chosen entry point we selected a neighboring vertex to visit next. We picked (0, 1) since it was a possible choice according to the graph. We could have also picked (1, 0).

Next we continued to pick new neighboring vertices to visit, each of them adjacent to the previously visited vertex, until we reached a token marked with <TARGET_START/END>.

We reached (3, 3) and finished our path, as there are no vertices adjacent to it marked with <TARGET_START/END>.

We verified that the path does not cross any walls by ensuring that we only move to neighboring vertices in the graph, which means that the path cannot cross any walls.

We also verified that the path uses only adjacent cells by ensuring that each step we took was to a vertex that is adjacent to the previous vertex we visited, as defined by the graph.
