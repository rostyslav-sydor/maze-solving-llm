One possible solution for the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the origin (0,0) and moves right one cell to (0,1). Then, it moves up one cell to (1,1), then right one cell to (1,2), then up one cell to (2,2), then right one cell to (2,3), and finally up one cell to (3,3), which is the target.

To verify that this solution is valid, we can check that each step in the path is a valid move according to the adjacency list. For example, the first step from (0,0) to (0,1) is valid because there is an edge between (0,0) and (0,1) in the adjacency list. Similarly, the second step from (0,1) to (1,1) is valid because there is an edge between (0,1) and (1,1) in the adjacency list. We can continue to check each step in the path in this way and verify that all steps are valid.

Additionally, we can check that the path does not cross any walls. A wall is represented by the absence of an edge between two cells in the adjacency list. For example, there is no edge between (0,0) and (1,0), which means that there is a wall between these two cells. We can check that the path does not cross any walls by verifying that there is an edge between each pair of adjacent cells in the path. For example, there is an edge between (0,0) and (0,1), which means that there is no wall between these two cells. Similarly, there is an edge between (0,1) and (1,1), which means that there is no wall between these two cells. We can continue to check each pair of adjacent cells in the path in this way and verify that there are no walls between any of them.

Therefore, the provided solution is a valid solution to the maze.
