<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (3,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,2) (2,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning**:
1. Start at the origin (0,0)
2. Move right to (0,1)
3. Move right again to (0,2)
4. Move up to (0,3)
5. Move right to (3,3)
6. Move down to (2,3)
7. Move left to (2,2)
8. Move down to (2,1)
9. Move right to (3,1)
10. Move down to (3,0)
11. Move left to (3,2)
12. Move up to (2,2)
13. Move left to (2,0)
14. Move up to (1,0)
15. Move right to (1,1)
16. Move right again to (1,2)
17. Move right again to (1,3)

This path uses only adjacent cells and does not cross any walls.

**Checking the solution**:

- (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1)
- (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2)
- (0,2) is adjacent to (0,3)
- (0,3) is adjacent to (3,3)
- (3,3) is adjacent to (2,3)
- (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2)
- (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1)
- (2,1) is adjacent to (3,1)
- (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0)
- (3,0) is adjacent to (3,2)
- (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)
- (2,2) is adjacent to (2,0)
- (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0)
- (1,0) is adjacent to (1,1)
- (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2)
- (1,2) is adjacent to (1,3)

Therefore, the solution is valid.
