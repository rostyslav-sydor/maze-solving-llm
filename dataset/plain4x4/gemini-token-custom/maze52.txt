**Reasoning:**

- Start at the origin point (0, 0) and follow the path until you reach the target point (3, 3).
- At each point, examine the adjacent points to determine which one leads to the target.
- If there are multiple adjacent points that lead to the target, choose the one that is closer to the target.
- Repeat this process until you reach the target point.

**Calculations:**

- Start at (0, 0)
- Move to (1, 0)
- Move to (1, 1)
- Move to (1, 2)
- Move to (1, 3)
- Move to (2, 3)
- Move to (3, 3)

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

**Verification:**

- The path does not cross any walls.
- The path uses only adjacent cells.
- The path starts at (0, 0) and ends at (3, 3).
