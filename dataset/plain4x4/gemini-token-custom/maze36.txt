<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

1. Start from the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
2. Since (1,0) is not adjacent to the target, move down to (1,1).
3. Follow the path to the right until you reach the target (3,3).

The solution does not cross any walls because it only moves between adjacent cells. It also uses only adjacent cells because each move is to a cell that is directly next to the current cell.
