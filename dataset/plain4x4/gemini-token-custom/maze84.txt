<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting from origin  (0,0) we must move either down or right. Moving down would be a dead end since there is no way to get to the exit from (1,0).

Thus we must move right to (1,0) and this forces us to move down to (1,1). Then we may only move right to (1,2) and down to (2,2). 

From (2,2) we can only move right to (3,2) and then up to (3,3) which is the exit.

This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells so it is a valid solution.
