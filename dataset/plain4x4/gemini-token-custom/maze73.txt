<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

1. Starting at the origin (0,0), we move right to (0,1).
2. We continue moving right to (0,2).
3. We then move up to (0,3).
4. We then move right to (1,3).
5. We then move up to (2,3).
6. Finally, we move right to the target (3,3).

**Reasoning:**

- Each step moves to a cell adjacent to the current cell.
- No step crosses a wall, as there are no walls between any of the cells in the path.
- The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3).
