<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (0,1). We then move down to (0,2) and then right again to (0,3). From there we move up to (1,3), then right to (2,3), and finally up to the target (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls because we only move between adjacent cells. The cells we visit are:

- (0,0)
- (0,1)
- (0,2)
- (0,3)
- (1,3)
- (2,3)
- (3,3)

All of these cells are adjacent to each other, so the path is valid.
