<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

From (0,0), we can move right to (1,0) as there is an edge between (0,0) and (1,0).

From (1,0), we can move down to (1,1) as there is an edge between (1,0) and (1,1).

From (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) as there is an edge between (1,1) and (1,2).

From (1,2), we can move down to (1,3) as there is an edge between (1,2) and (1,3).

From (1,3), we can move right to (3,3) as there is an edge between (1,3) and (3,3).

This path does not cross any walls as each move is between adjacent cells that are connected by an edge in the adjacency list. Hence this is a valid solution.
