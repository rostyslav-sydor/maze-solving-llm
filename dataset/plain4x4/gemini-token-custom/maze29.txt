**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

This maze is a simple grid with no obstacles. The shortest path from the origin to the target is to go right and then up.

**Verification:**

The path does not cross any walls because it only moves from one cell to an adjacent cell.

The path uses only adjacent cells because each cell in the path is connected to the next cell by an edge in the adjacency list.
