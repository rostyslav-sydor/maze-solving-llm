<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We start at the origin (0,0) and move to the right until we hit a wall at (3,0). 
Then we move up one row to (3,1) and continue moving right until we reach the target at (3,3).
This path does not cross any walls and uses only adjacent cells.
