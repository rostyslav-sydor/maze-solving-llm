One possible solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:

Starting from the origin (0,0), the path follows the edge to (1,0). From there, it follows the edge to (2,0). From there, it follows the edge to (3,0). From there, it follows the edge to (3,1). From there, it follows the edge to (3,2). Finally, it follows the edge to (3,3), which is the target.

Checking the solution:

The path does not cross any walls. All edges in the path are between adjacent cells.

Therefore, the solution is correct.
