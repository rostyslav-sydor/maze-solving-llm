<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

We start from the origin (0,0) and follow the path along the adjacency list until we reach the target (3,3). Each step in the path follows an edge in the adjacency list, ensuring that we only move between adjacent cells. We can verify that the path does not cross any walls by checking that each step is a valid edge in the adjacency list.
