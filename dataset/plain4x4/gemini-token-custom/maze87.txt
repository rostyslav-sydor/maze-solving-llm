<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

**Reasoning:**

Starting from the origin (0,0), we move right to (0,1). Then, we move down to (0,2) and then right to (0,3). From there, we move up to (1,3), then right to (2,3), and finally up to the target (3,3).

**Verification:**

* The path does not cross any walls because it only moves between adjacent cells.
* The path uses only adjacent cells because it moves either horizontally or vertically.
* The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3).
