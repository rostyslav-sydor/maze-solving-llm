One possible solution for the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:

The entry point is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (3,3). We can see that there is a path from the entry point to the exit point that does not cross any walls. The path uses only adjacent cells, which means that each cell in the path is adjacent to the previous cell.

To check if the solution is valid, we can iterate over the path and check if each cell is adjacent to the previous cell. We can also check if each cell is not a wall.

```
path = [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]

for i in range(1, len(path)):
    cell1 = path[i-1]
    cell2 = path[i]

    # Check if the cells are adjacent
    if not is_adjacent(cell1, cell2):
        return False

    # Check if the cell is not a wall
    if is_wall(cell2):
        return False

return True
```

The function `is_adjacent` checks if two cells are adjacent. The function `is_wall` checks if a cell is a wall.
