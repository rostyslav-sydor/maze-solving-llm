<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Let's walk through the maze step-by-step, starting from the origin at (0,0):

- From (0,0), we can move to (1,0) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.
- From (1,0), we can move to (2,0) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.
- From (2,0), we can move to (3,0) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.
- From (3,0), we can move to (3,1) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.
- From (3,1), we can move to (3,2) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.
- From (3,2), we can move to (3,3) because there is an edge between them in the adjacency list.

This path leads us from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3) without crossing any walls or using any non-adjacent cells, so it is a valid solution to the maze.
