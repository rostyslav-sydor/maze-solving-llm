The solution can be found by examining the adjacency list. Starting from the origin at (0,0) we can move to the adjacent cell (0,1) as per the list. 

From (0,1), we can move to either (0,2) or (1,1), but (0,2) leads to a dead end, so we choose (1,1). We continue this process until we reach the target at (3,3). The solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

To check if the solution does not cross any walls:
1. Check that every move in the solution is between adjacent cells. This is true because the solution only includes moves between cells that are connected in the adjacency list.
2. Check that the solution does not pass through any walls. This is true because the adjacency list only includes connections between cells that are not separated by a wall.
