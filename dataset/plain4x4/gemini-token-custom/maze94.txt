<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Reasoning:
Starting from the origin (0,0), we move right (0,1) -> (0,2) and up (0,2) -> (0,1), then right (0,1) -> (0,2) again and then right again (0,2) -> (0,3). From there we can only go up (0,3) -> (1,3), and then right (1,3) -> (2,3) and up again (2,3) -> (3,3) which is the target.

Checking:
- (0,0) is the origin and is not a wall
- Every move is to an adjacent cell
- (3,3) is the target and is not a wall
