To find the shortest path between the entry and exit points in the given maze, we can use A* (A-Star) search algorithm. Here are the steps to solve the maze:

1. Extract the entry and exit points: In this case, the entry point (origin) is (0,0) and the exit point (target) is (3,3).
2. Build a graph representation of the maze. The nodes in the graph are the cells in the maze and the edges represent the connections between them.
3. For each node, store the x and y coordinates as well as its connections to other nodes. For example, if a cell is connected to another cell, both cells would share an edge in the graph.
4. Calculate the heuristic cost between each node and the target node. The heuristic cost for a particular node can be estimated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y distance between the node and the target.
5. Choose the node with the lowest total cost (having the smallest sum of heuristic cost and the cost of reaching the node from the start) and expand it, exploring its neighboring nodes.
6. Repeat step 5 until you reach the target node or the search has not yielded any new nodes.
7. If the target node has the lowest total cost, then you have reached the solution. Otherwise, no solution exists.
8. Trace back the optimal path from the target node to the start node using the previously visited nodes list.

Following these steps, the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) for the given maze would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
