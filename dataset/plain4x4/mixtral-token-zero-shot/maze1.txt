<PATH_START> (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we find the solution:

1. Start at the origin point (0, 0).
2. Follow the path: (0, 0) --> (1, 0) [This is the first move that takes us from the origin point to the maze].
3. Look at the connections from (1, 0): (1, 0) <--> (2, 0).
4. Move to (2, 0): (1, 0) --> (2, 0).
5. Look at the connections from (2, 0): (2, 0) <--> (1, 0); (2, 0) <--> (3, 0).
6. Move to (3, 0): (2, 0) --> (3, 0).
7. Look at the connections from (3, 0): (3, 0) <--> (2, 0).
8. The path from (3, 0) leads back to (2, 0), which we've already visited. We need to backtrack.
9. Return to (2, 0): (3, 0) --> (2, 0).
10. Look at the connections from (2, 0): (2, 0) <--> (1, 0); (2, 0) <--> (3, 0). We've already visited both of these.
11. We need to backtrack further.
12. Return to (1, 0): (2, 0) --> (1, 0).
13. Look at the connections from (1, 0): (1, 0) <--> (2, 0).
14. The path from (1, 0) to (2, 0) does not lead to a new position. We need to backtrack again.
15. Return to (0, 0): (1, 0) --> (0, 0).
16. Look at the connections from (0, 0): (0,
