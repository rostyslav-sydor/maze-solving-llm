 If we represent the maze as a 4x4 grid, it looks like this:

     1  2  3  4
  1 - [0,0](III)[0,1]( O  )[0,2]( *  )[0,3](III)
  2 - [1,0]( *  )[1,1](III)[1,2](III)[1,3](III)
  3 - [2,0](III)[2,1]( O  )[2,2](III)[2,3]( *  )
  4 - [3,0]( *  )[3,1](III)[3,2](III)[3,3](XXX)

 To solve this maze, we can use a pathfinding algorithm like Dijkstra's Algorithm. Here is the list of steps we took to find the solution:

 1. Start at (0,0) and mark it as visited.

 2. Check the unvisited neighboring nodes (1,0), (0,1).
    Since (1,0) is blocked and (0,1) is not, choose (0,1).

 3. Mark (0,1) as visited, and check the unvisited neighboring nodes (0,2), (1,1).
    Both (0,2) and (1,1) are blocked, so choose neither.

 4. Go back to the previously visited node (0,0) and check the unvisited neighboring nodes (1,0).

 5. Mark (1,0) as visited, and check the unvisited neighboring nodes (2,0), (1,1).
    Since (1,1) is blocked and (2,0) is not, choose (2,0).

 6. Mark (2,0) as visited, and check the unvisited neighboring nodes (3,0), (2,1).
    Both (3,0) and (2,1) are blocked, so choose neither.

 7. Go back to the previously visited node (1,0), but its unvisited neighboring node (1,1) is already blocked.

 8. Go back to the previously visited node (0,0), but its un
