To find a solution for this maze, we can use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement BFS using this adjacency list representation:

1. Convert the adjacency list into a graph representation, where each node is represented by its coordinates (row, column).
2. Create a queue and enqueue the origin point (0, 0) into the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue a node from the queue.
    - If the node is the target point (3, 3), break out of the loop, and you've found the solution.
    - Otherwise, check if the node has unvisited neighbors. If it does, enqueue those neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.
4. If you reach this point in the algorithm, then either a solution is found, or there was no solution.
5. If a solution is found, follow the path from the target point back to the origin by traversing the parents of each node. You can represent this path as a list of coordinates, starting from the target point, in reverse order.
6. Output the solution as a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens:

   <PATH_START> (3, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 1) (0, 1) (0, 0) <PATH_END>
