We can use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path through the maze, starting from the origin (0,0) and ending at the target (3,3). BFS is an algorithm that visits nodes in a graph level by level, starting from the origin and checking all neighboring nodes before moving to the next level. It maintains a queue of nodes to visit and a visited set to avoid visiting the same node multiple times. Here is an implementation of BFS in pseudocode:

1. Initialize an empty queue, a visited set, and a path list.
2. Add the origin node to the queue and the visited set.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.
   b. If the node is the target node, append its path to the path list and return.
   c. For each neighbor of the node:
      i. If the neighbor is not in the visited set, add it to the visited set and append it to the current node's path.
      ii. Then, add the neighbor to the queue.
   d. Otherwise, backtrack by removing the last element of the current node's path.
4. If the queue becomes empty, there is no path from the origin to the target.

According to the maze adjacency list:

(0,0) <--> (0,1) , (0,1) <--> (1,1) , (1,1) <--> (1,0) , (1,0) <--> (2,0) , (2,0) <--> (2,1) , (2,1) <--> (3,1) , (3,1) <--> (3,0) , (3,0) <--> (3,1) , (3,1) <--> (3,2) , (3,2) <--> (3,3) , (3,3) <--> (2,3) , (2,3) <--> (2,2) , (2,2) <--> (1,2) , (1,2) <--> (0,2) , (0,2) <--> (0,3)
