 To solve the given maze, we can utilize the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a valid path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3). Here's the process:

1. Initialize the DFS function, which will keep track of visited vertices and return the solution once it reaches the target.
2. Start at the origin (0, 0). Add (0, 0) to the solution list and mark it as visited.
3. Iterate through all neighboring points to (0, 0), which are the adjacent vertices listed in the adjacency list. Only consider points that are not yet visited.
4. For each neighbor, call the DFS function recursively, providing the coordinates of the neighbor as the next origin.
5. Check for base cases:
   a) If the neighbor is the target (3, 3), return True.
   b) If the DFS function for any of the neighbors returns True, return True.
   c) If there are no more points to visit or DFS returns False for all neighbors, rewind by removing the current point from the solution and return False.
6. When the DFS function finds a valid path to the target, it will return True. At this point, the solution list will contain the correct path from the origin to the target.
7. Convert the solution list to a string in the expected format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
8. Output the final solution. Remember to replace the vertex numbers with their corresponding tuples when displaying the solution.

Applying this approach to the given maze results in the following path:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
