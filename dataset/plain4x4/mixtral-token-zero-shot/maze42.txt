Let's analyze the given maze using the adjacency list and find the coordinates representing a solution path.

The maze starts at (0, 0) and ends at (3, 3). From (0, 0), the only possible move is to (0, 1). Thus, the path has started as: <PATH_START> (0, 1).

From (0, 1), we can move to (0, 2), and from (0, 2) we can move to (0, 3). Now, from (0, 3) we can move to (1, 3). So far, the path is: <PATH_START> (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3).

From (1, 3), we can move to (2, 3). From (2, 3), we can move to (3, 3) which is the target point. Therefore, the complete solution path is: <PATH_START> (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>.
