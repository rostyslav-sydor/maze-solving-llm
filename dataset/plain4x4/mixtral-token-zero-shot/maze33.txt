 Step 1: Convert the description to a graph. Represent each coordinate as a node, and draw an edge between adjacent coordinates that represent valid moves in the maze. We'll mark the original position as starting node and target position as ending node.

 Step 2: We can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to traverse the graph. Let's choose BFS for this problem to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops.

 Step 3: Starting from the node representing the original position, explore adjacent nodes (vertices) until we reach the target node(vertex).

 step 4: Whenever we reach a node, check whether it represents the target position. If it's not the target node, mark it as visited and add unmarked adjacent nodes to a queue.

 Step 5: Once the target node is reached, we'll start reconstructing the path based on the record of previous moves maintained through the search.

 To do this, start from the target node, repeatedly backtrack to the previous node until the original position is reached.

 To reconstruct the path:
 - Insert the target coordinated into the list.
 - Starting from the origin coordinated and for each coordinated in your path:
   - Examine the record of previous moves started at the current coordinated.
   - Let the deepest level (or last one visited—last in, first out) move be (x,y), then find row x and column y where (x,y) equals the current coordinated.
   - Record next position (x1,y1) with x1 being either x−1 or +1 and y1 either y−1 or +1 and record its row in array as X coordinate and its column as Y coordinate and go to the next step, then implements the path solving algorithm.

  Write down your solutions:

  - Get the row (x) and column (y) of the start position: S = (xS: row of start position), (yS: column of start position).

  - Get the row (x) and column (y) of the target position: T = (xT: row of target position), (yT: column of target position).

  - Check if start(x,y) or target(x,y) exist as nodes in the graph
