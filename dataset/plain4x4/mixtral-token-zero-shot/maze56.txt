 To solve this maze using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, my step-by-step process would be as follows:

1. Extract the maze information into a data structure, storing the adjacent coordinates for each cell.
    Based on the provided input, here's the extracted maze in a more readable format:
    Adjacency list of coordinates:
    
    - (1,3) ←→ (0,3)
    - (3,2) ←→ (2,2)
    - (0,0) ←→ (0,1)
    - (2,3) ←→ (1,3)
    - (1,1) ←→ (2,1)
    - (1,3) ←→ (1,2)
    - (3,3) ←→ (2,3)
    - (1,2) ←→ (1,1)
    - (3,1) ←→ (2,1)
    - (3,2) ←→ (3,3)
    - (0,1) ←→ (0,2)
    - (1,0) ←→ (0,0)
    - (3,1) ←→ (3,0)
    - (0,2) ←→ (0,3)
    - (2,0) ←→ (3,0)

2. Initialize a queue data structure and a set to keep track of visited cells.

3. Enqueue the origin (0,0). Set the parent of (0,0) as -1 (no parent since it's the origin).

4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a cell (currentCell).
   b. If currentCell is the target (3,3), construct the path from the cell's parent and return it.
   c. If currentCell has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.
   d. For each adjacent cell of currentCell, if that cell is not the parent and has not been visited: Add it to the queue and set its parent as currentCell.

   Once the algorithm finds the target, it will trace back the parents
