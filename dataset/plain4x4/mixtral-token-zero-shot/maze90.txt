Step 1: Initialize data structures to represent the maze.
Step 2: Traverse the graph and store the adjacency list in a HashMap.
Step 3: Check if the origin and target point is reachable and create a queue with one being the origin node as initial state.
Step 4: While the queue is not empty:
     i. Remove the first node and check if it is the target node. If it is, return the path.
     ii. If not, add all neighbor nodes which are not visited yet to the queue.
     iii. Mark the current node as visited.

Step 5: If no target node is found, there is no path.
Step 6: Print out the path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.


Path found: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (0,1) (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
