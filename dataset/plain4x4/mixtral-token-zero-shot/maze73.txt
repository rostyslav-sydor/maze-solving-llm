It looks like I need to analyze an adjacency list and find the shortest path between (0,0) and (3,3). This is a graph search problem, and can be solved using algorithms like Breadth First Search or Depth First Search, or finding the minimum cost path using Dijkstra's Algorithm. However, for this maze, the cost of each path will be uniform, so Breadth First Search seems optimal.

To simplify the task, here are the edges and the start and end point given above.
```
Edges:
    (3,2) <--> (3,3)
    (1,3) <--> (2,3)
    (1,2) <--> (1,1)
    (0,1) <--> (0,0)
    (3,1) <--> (3,0)
    (2,2) <--> (2,1)
    (1,0) <--> (0,0)
    (0,2) <--> (0,1)
    (3,0) <--> (2,0)
    (2,3) <--> (3,3)
    (0,3) <--> (1,3)
    (1,2) <--> (1,3)
    (2,1) <--> (3,1)
    (2,0) <--> (1,0)
    (0,2) <--> (1,2)

Start: (0,0)
End: (3,3)
```

Performing a Breadth First Search with one of the coordinates always increasing, a valid path could be:

Start <> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) <> End
Here, we always moved coordinate first east, then north, with a rest of only left and right turns.

And in the requested format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This Breadth First Search finds
