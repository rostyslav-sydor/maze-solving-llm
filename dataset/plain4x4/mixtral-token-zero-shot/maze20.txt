 To find the path through the maze, we first need to create a graph from the given adjacency list. The graph should be a representation of the connections between the nodes (coordinates) and the shortest path between the origin and target nodes.

The graph can be represented using a dictionary of nodes containing their adjacent nodes. Here's a summary of the adjacency list provided:

(1,2) <--> (1,1), (1,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,0), (3,2)
(1,3) <--> (1,2), (2,3)
(3,3) <--> (2,3), (3,2)
(1,2) <--> (0,2), (1,1)
(3,2) <--> (3,1), (3,3)
(3,0) <--> (2,0), (3,1)
(1,0) <--> (0,0), (1,1)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(2,0) <--> (1,0), (2,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,0), (0,2)
(2,3) <--> (1,3), (2,2)
(0,3) <--> (0,2), (1,3)

After converting the adjacency list into a graph, we need to implement a graph traversal algorithm to find the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3). One suitable algorithm for this problem is Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

In Dijkstra's algorithm, we maintain a priority queue that keeps track of nodes we need to visit, the current distance from our origin, and the nodes' parent in the path. For the origin node (0,0), we put it in the priority queue with a distance 0 and parent as "empty." We then repeat a few steps until the target node (3,3) is popped out of the priority queue:

1. Take the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue, let's name it as "current node."
2. Relax all neighbors of the
