To solve this maze using a breadth-first search algorithm, we can do the following:

1. Extract the adjacency list from the input.
2. Extract the origin and target points from the input.
3. Create an empty queue for storing vertices to be explored and a dictionary to store visited vertices.
4. Enqueue the origin vertex into the queue and mark it as visited.
5. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty or we reach the target vertex:
	a. Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
	b. Check if it is the target vertex; if so, print the path and exit.
	c. Iterate through all its neighbors.
	d. Mark each unvisited neighbor as visited and enqueue it into the queue.
	e. Store the current vertex as the predecessor of its neighbors in the dictionary.
6. If the target vertex hasn't been reached after exploring all possible paths, print "No solution found."

To output the path from the origin to the target, we can do the following:

1. Initialize an empty path list.
2. Set the current vertex to be the target vertex.
3. Repeat the following steps until we reach the origin vertex:
	a. Append the current vertex to the path list.
	b. Set the current vertex to be the vertex stored as its predecessor in the dictionary.
4. Reverse the path list and output the coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
