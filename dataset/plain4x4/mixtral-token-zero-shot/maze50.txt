To solve this maze using breadth-first search, let's reason through the following steps:

1. Define a graph data structure using an adjacency list representation.
2. Implement the breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph until we find the target node (3,3).
3. Collect the path from the origin to the target node.

Here's the reasoning translated into code:

```python
visited = set()  # A set to keep track of visited nodes
queue = []  # A queue for the breadth-first search

# Define a class to represent the graph nodes
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.neighbors = []

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Function to create the graph from the adjacency list
def create_graph(adj_list):
    nodes = {}
    for edge in adj_list:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = [int(c) for c in edge.split()]
        if (x1, y1) not in nodes:
            nodes[(x1, y1)] = Node(x1, y1)
        if (x2, y2) not in nodes:
            nodes[(x2, y2)] = Node(x2, y2)
        nodes[(x1, y1)].neighbors.append((x2, y2))
    return nodes

# Find the origin and target nodes from the adjacency list
def find_origin_target(adj_list):
    origin, target = None, None
    for edge in adj_list:
        if edge.startswith("<ORIGIN_START>") and edge.endswith("<ORIGIN_END>"):
            origin = (int(edge.split()[1][1:-1]), int(edge.split()[2][:-1]))
        elif edge.startswith("<TARGET_START>") and edge.endswith("<TARGET_END>"):
            target = (int(edge.split()[1][1:-1]), int(edge.split()[2
