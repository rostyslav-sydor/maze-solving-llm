[Step 1: Create a Matrix to Represent the Maze]
To find a solution for the maze, let's first create a 4x4 matrix representation of it from the given adjacency list:

Matrix:
   -   0 1 2 3
   0 \__
         o   o
             |
   1  o   o  
         |
         |   o
   2  o o o  
         |
         |   o
   3  o o o  
             |
             |

[Step 2: Mark the Origin and Target]
In this matrix format, the origin (start) is (0,0), and the target (end) is (3,3). Initially, we can move from (0,0) to adjacent tiles (0,1) and (1,0).

[Step 3: Implement a Path-finding Algorithm]
Use a path-finding algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the maze by following adjacent nodes while maintaining a path stack.

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Mark this (0,0) as visited and add it to the path stack.
3. Repeat the following steps until you reach the target (3,3):
    a. Check the neighboring (adjacent) tiles that we haven't visited and can move to: North (row - 1), South (row + 1), East (column + 1), and West (column - 1).
    b. Try moving to each neighboring tile, maintaining the path stack by adding the current tile to it.
    c. When a valid move is made (e.g., reaching (1,1) from (0,0)), remove the previous tile from the path stack and add the new one.
    d. If you can't move to any neighboring tile, backtrack by restoring the previous tile from the stack and remove the current one.
    e. Keep checking if you reached the target (3,3).

[Step 4: Found the Solution Path]
After successfully reaching the target (3,3) using the path-finding algorithm, extract the coordinate data from the path stack in reverse order.
