First, let's analyze the given maze. It is represented as an adjacency list for a graph of tokens. The entry point is at (0, 0) and the exit point is at (3, 3). We need to find a path from the entry to the exit, using the tokens as our path.

Now, let's start from the entry point, (0, 0). According to the adjacency list, (0, 0) is connected to (0, 2). We will now add this connection to our path list:

<PATH_START> (0, 2) <PATH_END>

Next, we will continue to follow the path from (0, 2) to its connected tokens. (0, 2) is connected to (0, 3), so we'll add this to the path as well:

<PATH_START> (0, 3) <PATH_END>

Now, let's follow the path from (0, 3) to its connected tokens. (0, 3) is connected to (1, 3). So, we'll add this to the path:

<PATH_START> (1, 3) <PATH_END>

Next, let's follow the path from (1, 3) to its connected tokens. (1, 3) is connected to (2, 3) and (3, 3). Since we are aiming for (3, 3), the exit point, we'll head towards it:

<PATH_START> (3, 3) <PATH_END>

Now, we've successfully reached the exit point. Here's the complete list we've compiled from the above analysis:

<PATH_START> (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

To separate the tokens and comply with the given format, let's modify our list as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

And there we have it! We have successfully found a solution for the given maze.
