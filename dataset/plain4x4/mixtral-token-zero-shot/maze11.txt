Reasoning: In order to find the shortest path between (0,0) and (3,3) in the given adjacency list, we can apply the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which will explore all possible paths from the starting point and output the shortest one.

Step 1: Convert the given adjacency list into a matrix:
```python
maze = [
    [None, None, None, None],
    [None, (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0)],
    [None, (2, 0), (2, 3), (1, 0)],
    [None, None, None, None],
]
```
Step 2: Implement the BFS algorithm:
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(maze, start, end):
    queue = deque([[start]])
    visited = set(start)

    while queue:
        path = queue.popleft()
        node = path[-1]

        if node == end:
            return path

        for next_node in maze[node[0]][node[1]]:
            if next_node not in visited:
                visited.add(next_node)
                new_path = list(path)
                new_path.append(next_node)
                queue.append(new_path)

    return None

path = bfs(maze, (0,0), (3,3))
```
Output the shortest path:
<|user|>
What is the time complexity of BFS?
