To find a solution for the given maze, we need to use a pathfinding algorithm like Dijkstra's or A* (A star), which are both breadth-first search algorithms. However, since you haven't specified which one you prefer, I'll use Dijkstra's algorithm for this solution.

1. Set up a graph based on the adjacency list with <ORIGIN> node as our source and <TARGET> node as our destination.
2. Initialize all other nodes to have a distance of infinity.
3. Set <ORIGIN> node's distance to 0 and add it to a priority queue, which is ordered by smallest distance first.
4. For each iteration, we'll extract the smallest distance node from the priority queue (let's call this node X).
5. For all nodes that are connected to X, we'll compare their distance and update it if it is less than the distance of node X plus the weight of edge (X to new node), also add it to the priority queue.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until we reach our <TARGET> node or we've checked all nodes.
7. If we found <TARGET> node, we can trace our path by going backwards from node to ancestor.
8. Return the path between the <ORIGIN> and <TARGET> by outputting the coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.

Now let's apply the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path in the maze:

1. Initialise graph:
Adjacency list:
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,
