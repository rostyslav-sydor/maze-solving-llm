To find the shortest path through the given maze, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for a graph search because it visits the adjacent vertices at the current depth before moving on to the next level. This will allow us to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here are the steps to implement BFS for this problem:

1. Create two data structures: a queue for BFS (FIFO) and a visited set to keep track of the visited vertices.
2. Add the origin vertex to the visited set and enqueue it in the queue.
3. Start a loop while the queue is not empty:
	* Dequeue a vertex from the queue and do a print for each vertex for debugging (tracing the path once you've found it).
	* Traverse the adjacent vertices of the current vertex and check each one: 
		- If the adjacent vertex is not in the visited set, add it to the visited set and enqueue it in the queue.
		- If the adjacent vertex is equal to the target vertex, we've found the shortest path. Break the loop.
4. After finding the shortest path, print the coordinates of all the visited vertices (the shortest path) between the tokens: <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.
5. Output the result.
