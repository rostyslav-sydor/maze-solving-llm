To find the solution for this maze, we need to trace the path from the <ORIGIN_START> to the <TARGET_END> based on the given adjacency list. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Starting coordinate: (0, 0) [<ORIGIN_START>]
2. Possible next moves: (1, 0)
3. Go to (1, 0)
4. Possible next moves: (1,1)
5. Go to (1,1)
6. Possible next moves: (1, 2)
7. Go to (1, 2)
8. Possible next moves: (1, 3), (2, 2) [avoid moving back to (1, 1)]
9. Go to (2, 2)
10. Possible next moves: (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)
11. Go to (3, 2) [avoid moving back to (2, 2)]
12. Possible next moves: (3, 1)
13. Go to (3, 1)
14. Possible next moves: (3, 2), (3, 3)
15. Go to (3, 3) [<TARGET_END>]

The solution path, as requested in-between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
