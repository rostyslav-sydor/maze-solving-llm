We are provided with a maze represented as an adjacency list designating the connections between nodes. Each node is labeled with its coordinates (row, column). We need to find a path from the origin node to the target node.

First, we need to determine the coordinates of the origin and target nodes. The origin node is at coordinates (0, 0), and the target node is at (3, 3).

We will use a depth-first search algorithm to explore the maze and find a path. We start at the origin node (0, 0).

1. Push the origin node onto a stack, and set its `visited` status to True. Since it is already given, there's no need to add an edge going out of the origin.
2. While the stack is not empty:
  a) Pop a node from the stack. This is the current node.
  b) If the current node is the target node, output the path leading to the target and exit the function.
  c) Otherwise, find all unvisited neighbors of the current node. For each neighbor:
        - Push the neighbor onto the stack.
        - Set the neighbor's `visited` status to True.
        - Add an edge connecting the current node and the neighbor to the adjacency list.

Now, we need to apply this process to the given maze:

<ADJLIST_START>
(0,0) <--> (0,1)
(1,1) <--> (1,2)
(1,2) <--> (1,3)
(2,3) <--> (1,3)
(3,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,2) <--> (3,3)
(3,2) <--> (2,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,2)
(2,1) <--> (2,0)
(1,0) <--> (0,0)
<ADJLIST_END>

Following the path from the origin to the target, we get:

<PATH_START>
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(0,3)
(1,3)
(2,3)
(3
