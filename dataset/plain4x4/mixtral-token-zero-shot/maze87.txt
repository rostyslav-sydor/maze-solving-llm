Here's how we can analyze the maze logically using graph data structures and algorithms:

1. Parse the adjacency list, and extract the edges between the different coordinates: `(3, 1) -- (3, 0), (3, 1) -- (2, 1), (3, 2) -- (3, 3), (3, 2) -- (2, 2), (2, 3) -- (1, 3), (2, 3) -- (3, 3), (2, 2) -- (2, 3), (2, 2) -- (2, 1), (2, 1) -- (2, 0), (2, 0) -- (1, 0), (2, 0) -- (3, 0), (1, 3) -- (1, 2), (1, 2) -- (1, 1), (1, 1) -- (0, 1), (1, 1) -- (1, 0), (0, 2) -- (0, 3), (0, 2) -- (1, 2), (0, 2) -- (0, 1), (0, 1) -- (0, 0), (0, 0) -- <ORIGIN_START>, (3, 3) -- <TARGET_END>`
2. Identify the origin and target coordinates from the start and end tokens: `origin = (0, 0); target = (3, 3)`
3. Apply a path-finding algorithm such as Depth-first Search (DFS), Breadth-first Search (BFS), or A* to find a path between the origin and target coordinates, using the available edges:
`((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3))`
4. Filter and only keep the vertex (coordinate) pairs between start and end to get the solution path:
`solution = (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3,
