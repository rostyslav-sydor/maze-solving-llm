 We could use different techniques for path finding, such as Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, or A*. However, we'll utilize a simpler approach with Breadth-First Search (BFS). 

To simplify solving the maze using BFS, let's follow these steps:

1. Incrementally expand paths (tokens) originating from the start token (0,0).
2. Newly explored paths should be marked as explored using a visitation flag on the node or an adjacency set. 
3. When we arrive at a position, check if it's the goal token. If so, stop the process and output the found path.
4. Update current path with newly adjacented neighbors until we arrive at the goal token.
5. Remember to explore some paths by pushing them into a pool (usually a queue or stack) to be processed later. 

Here's what it would look like in pseudo-code:

```
Function solveMazeByBFS():
   Set startingToken to token (0,0)
   Set currentPath to [startingToken]
   Start from startingToken
   While we have less explored tokens than total tokens:
      Explore from currentToken in currentPath
         For all currently unexplored neighbors (with token as neighbor):
            Set visite flag on neighbor to true
            Set neighbor's predeccesor to the current token
            Enqueue neighbor to the end of the currentPath
            If token not yet in path, append token into the path
         If neighbor is the goal token, stop our process here:
            Set pathFound to true
            Break the while loop
      CurrentToken <- Next token which has not yet been explored from the currentPath.
   If pathFound:
      Return the path from the start to the goal token (by reading predeccesors)
   Else:
      Return "- No solution found -"
```

This way we'll avoid using extra memory for a separate adjacency set or uniform-cost mapping. It is not as efficient as BFS using a queue or Dijkstra in practice, but it is readable and easy to implement.

Consider a simpler representation of the maze. Write algorithms for constant and reference time (time taken when there is
