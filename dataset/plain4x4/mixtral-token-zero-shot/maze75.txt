To find a solution for this maze, we can use either a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is represented as an adjacency list, we'll use a depth-first search approach with backtracking. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize an empty solution stack and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Push the origin node onto the stack and mark it as visited.
3. While the stack is not empty, repeat the following steps:
    a. Pop the top node from the stack (currentNode).
    b. If the current node is the target node, we've found a solution. Break out of the loop.
    c. Iterate through the neighbors of the current node:
        i. If a neighbor has not been visited, push it onto the stack and mark it as visited.
        ii. If a neighbor is the target node, push it onto the stack and break out of the loop.
4. If the target node is not found after exploring all nodes, there is no solution to the maze.
5. Trace the solution by popping nodes from the stack until the target node is reached.

Applying this algorithm to the given maze, we get the following solution path:

1. Origin node: (0, 0)
2. (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3)

The solution path can be represented in the required format as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Please note that this is just one possible solution for the given maze. There might be multiple solutions, depending on the specific problem instance. Also, this description is around 200 words.
