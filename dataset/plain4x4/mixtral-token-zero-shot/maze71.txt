A breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm can be used to find a path through a grid-based maze using adjacency lists. Let's follow the steps to solve this maze:
1. Parse the adjacency list and convert it to a graph representation with edges
2. Initialize the origin and target nodes
3. Perform a breadth-first search to find a path from origin to target
4. Reconstruct the path from the target node
5. Print the reconstructed path

Here's the detailed explanation:
Step 1: Parse the adjacency list and convert it to a graph representation with edges
First, parse the adjacency list and create the graph as a dictionary of dictionaries. Each node (coordinate) in the graph will be represented as (row, column). Store the edges in a list as well, where an edge is a tuple of two nodes.

Step 2: Initialize the origin and target nodes
Our origin node is (0, 0) as <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>, and our target node is (3, 3) as the <TARGET_START> (3, 3) <TARGET_END>.
Step 3: Perform a breadth-first search to find a path from origin to target
Use a breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph starting from the origin node (0, 0) until the target node (3, 3) is reached. While traversing, keep track of the parents for each node, so we can reconstruct the path later.

Step 4: Reconstruct the path from the target node
Upon reaching the target point (3, 3), we will reconstruct the path from the target node by following the parents' relationships backward until we reach the origin node.
Step 5: Print the reconstructed path
Finally, print the reconstructed path as a list of coordinates between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, starting with the end of the path (3, 3) and working backward towards (0.0).

The algorithm should find the solution as <PATH_START> (3, 3) (2, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 1) (0, 1)
