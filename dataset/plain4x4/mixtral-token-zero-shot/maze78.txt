The adjacency list of maze tokens represents a graph with vertices marked by coordinates and edges connecting adjacent vertices. The goal is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) and output it in coordinate list form.

Step 1: Parse the adjacency list to create the graph data structure, with vertices (vertices) and edges (edges). 
Step 2: Initiate the search algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A*. Set the origin and target to their corresponding graph vertices. 
Step 3: In the search loop, find all the accessible adjacent vertices (neighbors) of the current vertex, including their Euclidean/Manhattan distances to the target, add them to the priority queue.
Step 4: Extract the smallest distance vertex from the priority queue and add it to the path.
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until reaching the target node (3,3).
Step 6: Construct the path by retracing the nodes from the target node to the origin using the edges utilized in the search. This path will be stored in a list or array between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.
Step 7: Answer with the path in the required format.

Summarizing the above steps, here are the instructions to produce the solution:
1. Parse adjacency list
2. Apply search algorithm
3. Find and store vertices to priority queue
4. Extract and add vertex with smallest distance
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until reaching target
6. Construct path by retracing nodes
7. Answer with path (<PATH_START> <coordinate list> <PATH_END>)
