To solve this maze, we'll use a graph search algorithm called Depth-First Search (DFS). We start at the origin (0, 0) and explore each unvisited edge in the adjacency list. When there are no more unvisited edges, we backtrack to the previous node and keep exploring until we reach the target (3, 3) or there are no more paths to explore.

Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for maze solving:

1. Start at the origin (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. If we've reached the target (3, 3), stop and output the path.
3. From the current node, explore each unvisited neighbor in the adjacency list. If it leads to the target, stop and output the path.
4. If not, mark the neighbor as visited, and explore its unvisited neighbors recursively using DFS.
5. If we've explored all possible paths and haven't found the target, backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring unvisited neighbors.

Now, we apply the DFS algorithm to the provided maze using its adjacency list. Here are the steps taken:

* From origin (0, 0), we first visit (1, 0) since it's next in the adjacency list.
* From (1, 0), we visit (2, 0) and then go backtracking to (0, 0) because no more unvisited adjacent nodes.
* Since there are no more unvisited edges from (0, 0), we go back to (1, 0).
* From (1, 0), we visit (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (1, 3).
* From (1, 3), we backtrack to (1, 2) and then (1, 1), as there are no more unvisited edges.
* From (1, 1), we visit (0, 1).
* From (0, 1), we visit (0, 2) and then (0, 3).
* From (0, 3), we visit (1, 3). Since it leads to the target (3, 3), we found a successful path and output
