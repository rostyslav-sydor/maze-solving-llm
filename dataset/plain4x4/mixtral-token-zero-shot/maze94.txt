To solve the maze using the given graph represented as an adjacency list, we can use a search algorithm like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the origin to the target. In this case, we'll use DFS, as it is suitable for finding paths in a maze-like structure. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the maze:

1. Extract the adjacency list from the input text:
<ADJLIST_START> (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; <ADJLIST_END>

2. Identify the origin and target coordinates:
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

3. Initialize a graph data structure (adjacency list or adjacency matrix) using the extracted adjacency list.

4. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a valid path from the origin to the target. The DFS should:
    a. Begin at the origin coordinate.
    b. Recursively explore all adjacent unvisited coordinates.
    c. Mark visited coordinates as visited to avoid revisiting them.
    d. If the target coordinate is reached, return the current path.
    e. If all adjacent coordinates have been explored and the target coordinate is not reached, backtrack to the previous coordinate and continue
