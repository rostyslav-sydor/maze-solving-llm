1. Convert the adjacency list into a graph representation where nodes represent the coordinates and edges represent the connections between nodes.
2. Choose a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to find the shortest path between the starting point and the target point.
3. Pick BFS as it has a more straightforward approach to finding the shortest path in a graph.
4. Find edge cases, such as if the start or target point is not a valid node in the graph or if there is no path between the start and target point in the maze.
5. Choose a data structure to hold visited nodes in the graph and distance from the starting node for BFS. A queue and table would be appropriate.
6. Update the queue and distance table in each iteration while replacing a new distance if it is shorter than the previous one.
7. Perform BFS on the graph until the target node has been visited or the queue is empty, with no further nodes to visit.
8. Extract the shortest path from the distance table and output it in the desired format with respect to the given tokens.
 
 output: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
