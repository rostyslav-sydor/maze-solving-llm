 We will use a depth-first approach to solve the maze, exploring and backtracking through possible paths. In this step, we will first define the exploration function.
```python
def explore(position, visited, maze, path, origin, target):
    """
    Explore the maze from a given position to find a path to the target.
    
    Args:
    - position (tuple): Current position (row, column)
    - visited (set): Set of already visited positions
    - maze (dict): Adjacency list representation of the maze
    - path (list): Path of already visited positions
    """
    # Add current position to the path
    path.append(position)

    # Mark the current position as visited
    visited.add(position)

    # If we've reached the target, save the path
    if position == target:
        return True

    # Try all connected positions not yet visited
    for connected_position in maze[position]:
        if connected_position not in visited:
            if explore(connected_position, visited, maze, path, origin, target):
                return True

    # Backtrack: remove current position from the path
    path.pop()

    return False
```
Next, we will analyze the adjacency list representation of the maze, transform it into a dict, and find the origin and target positions. Then, we will apply the explore function and check the resulting path.

We will need the following variables:
- `maze_dict`: dict representation of the maze adjacency list
- `origin_position`: origin position (row, column)
- `target_position`: target position (row, column)
- `visited`: set of visited positions to keep track of already visited positions
- `path`: list of coordinates representing the path from the origin to the target
- `solution`: Boolean flag for successful run

Here's the continuation of our step-by-step solution:
```python
# Split the maze adjacency list string into a list of edges
maze_list = tokens.lstrip("<ADJLIST_START>").rstrip("<ADJLIST_END>").split(";")
