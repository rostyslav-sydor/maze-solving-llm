 To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, we can approach it using a simple graph traversal algorithm like depth-first search (DFS).

First, let's adapt the given representation:

<ADJLIST_START>
(0,2) -> (0,1);
(2,3) -> (1,3);
(3,2) -> (3,1);
(2,3) -> (2,2);
(1,1) -> (1,2);
(0,3) -> (0,2);
(1,1) -> (1,0);
(1,0) -> (2,0);
(0,1) -> (0,0);
(2,2) -> (2,1);
(1,0) -> (0,0);
(3,0) -> (3,1);
(3,2) -> (3,3);
(1,3) -> (1,2);
(2,0) -> (3,0);
</ADJLIST_END>

1. We start at the origin point: (0,0)
2. Apply a depth-first search algorithm:
   a. All available edges are shown in the adjacency list, we cannot move diagonally. So, check for (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).
   b. Starting with (0,1), the neighbor is (0,2), which we haven't visited yet. So, mark (0,2) as visited and add it to our path.
   c. From (0,2), the next neighbor is (0,3), which hasn't been visited. Add (0,3) to the path.
   d. Similar steps would apply for (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1). However, one edge, (1,1) -> (1,2), will lead us to a dead-end. When this happens, backtrack and choose a different neighbor until you reach the target (3,3).

3. After iterating and building a path, we will find the solution from origin to target:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0
