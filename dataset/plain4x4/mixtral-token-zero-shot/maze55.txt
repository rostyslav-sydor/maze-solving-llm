In cognitive graph theory, we can solve this maze problem following these steps:

1. Parse the adjacency list to construct an equivalent graph.
2. Identify the origin and target cell locations from the given tokens.
3. Apply graph search algorithms to find a path between the origin and the target.
4. Output the sequence of steps as a coordinate list.

Let's proceed:

1. Adjacency list clearly tells us that the graph is a grid of 4 rows and 4 columns. Each node represents a cell in this grid, represented by (ROW, COL).

2. Origin = (0,0), Target = (3,3)

3. Now let's apply a graph search algorithm like Breadth-First Search(BFS).
	a. Start from origin (0, 0).
	b. Explore the neighboring cells and mark their parent to be the origin.
		- (0, 1): marked (0, 0) as parent'	- (1, 0): marked (0, 0) as parent
	c. Continue exploration while maintaining the 'sparse potential field', which helps to avoid cycles and minimizes detours in maze solving, by not bothering to explore previously visited cells with lower costs.
	d. Repeat â€” until you find the target (3, 3). For BFS, this will find a path with fewest step/nodes.

4. Output the solution path as a segment connected with steps, in coordinate list form:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

By following these steps, we have found a solution for the given maze using cognitive graph theory and Breadth-First Search algorithm.

Note: These are general steps for an algorithmic solution, a real-world maze solving system would have additional considerations and implementations based on specific requirements, such as heuristic search, learning optimization, etc.
