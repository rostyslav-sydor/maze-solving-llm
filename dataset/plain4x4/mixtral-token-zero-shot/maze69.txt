An easy approach to tackle this maze is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph starting from position (0,0) and targeting node (3,3). For the sake of brevity, we omit human-readable details for the solution, instead presenting only the path coordinates:

The resulting path is as follows:
<PATH_START>
(0,0)   (0,1)   (0,2)   (0,3)   (1,3)   (2,3)   (3,3)
<PATH_END>

It's the simplest and shortest hint for LLM to understand and process that we provide here, allowing it to recognize the solution while staying within the word limit of your prompt. Of course, in the real world, you would rarely find such an abbreviated description, and more context would likely be needed.
