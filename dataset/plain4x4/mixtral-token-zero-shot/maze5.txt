First, let's convert the adjacency list to a graph:

(1,1) ------ (1,2) ------- (1,3)
  / 
(0,1) ------ (0,2) ------- (0,3)
  | 
(2,1) ------ (2,2) ------- (2,3)
 
(1,0) ------ (1,1) ------ (1,2)
 
(0,0) <ORIGIN_START>- (0,1) ------- (0,2) ------- (0,3)
 
(2,0) ------ (2,1) 

(3,2) - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - (3,3) TARGET_END
  |           
(3,0) - - - - - (3,1) 
(1,0)

Next, we'll start at the origin and traverse the graph until we find a path to the target. Each (row, column) pair represents the coordinates of a graph node.

To find a path from the origin to the target, we can use breadth-first search to examine all possible paths until we find a successful route. Here's an outline of how it might work:

1. Add the origin node to the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty:
a. Dequeue the first node in the queue.
b. If this node is the target, output the path and exit.
c. Enqueue each of the node's neighbors that we haven't visited yet (adding the current node as the previous node of the newly enqued node)
3. We reach this point only if there is no path from the origin to the target.

If a successful path is found, the result would be output as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
