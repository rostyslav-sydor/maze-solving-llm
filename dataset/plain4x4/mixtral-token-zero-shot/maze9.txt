Let's apply depth-first search algorithm to find the solution for this maze. Here are the steps:

1. Read the adjacency list from the input file.
2. Find the starting and destination points from the input file tokens (<ORIGIN_START>, <TARGET_START>,<ORIGIN_END> and <TARGET_END>). Let's call the starting point as source and the destination as target.
3. Create a visited set to keep track of the nodes we visited.
4. Perform depth-first search from source to destination.
4.1. Start from the source.
4.2. Visit its adjacent nodes with the following conditions:
	- Node is not visited
	- Node is accessible directly or through a door
	- Node is not a wall/obstacle
5. If the destination node is found, then return the path from source to destination.
6. Otherwise, backtrack and try a different path.

Here is the plan for our solution:

1. Start at (0,0). 
2. Check for its unvisited and accessible neighbors. Possible neighbors are (1,0), (1,1), (0, -1)
3. Select a neighbor that is not a wall or an obstacle or previously visited node.
4. Move to this node and set the current node as the parent of the newly selected node.
5. Repeat the process till we find the destination node (3,3).
6. Create a path from target node to starting node by following the parent of the selected node.
7. Print the resultant path between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

The resulting plan is a strategy to traverse the maze using depth-first search algorithm to find a solution. It utilizes the list available in the input file for transition from one node to answer node (3,3).

Summarizing the plan:
1. Find the start and end points using tokens <ORIGIN_START>, <ORIGIN_END>, <TARGET_START> and <TARGET_END> respectively.
2. Perform depth-first search using unvisited, accessible and not a wall/obstacle nodes starting from the source.
3. Upon finding the target, build the path by following the parent nodes of the visited nodes from target
