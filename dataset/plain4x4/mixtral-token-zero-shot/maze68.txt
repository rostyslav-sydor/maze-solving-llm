To find a solution for this maze, we'll follow these steps:

1. Store values from the adjacency list in an appropriate data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a 2D array).
2. Convert the maze to a graph representation, where nodes are grid coordinates and edges are adjacency list connections.
3. Create a queue to keep track of nodes to be visited.
4. Start at the origin (0, 0) and add the origin to the queue.
5. While the queue is not empty:
	* a. Dequeue a node from the queue and remove it from the unvisited list of nodes.
	* b. Check if the dequeued node is equal to `TARGET`. If it is, create a path object with the origin and target nodes and return it. Otherwise, continue to step (c).
	* c. Add neighbor nodes of the dequeued node to the queue, if they are not already visited, and mark them as visited in the visited list.
	* d. Repeat steps (a) to (d) until no path exists or the target node has been reached.
6. Print the final path between `ORIGIN` and `TARGET` between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens.

Let's implement this algorithm and output the result in the required format:

<ADJLIST_START>
(3,2) <--> (2,2) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (0,1) <--> (0,2) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,1) <--> (2,1) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (2,2) <--> (1,2) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (2,0) <--> (1,0) ;
