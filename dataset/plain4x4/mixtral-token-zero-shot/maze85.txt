Perform a depth-first search, starting with the entry point. Keep track of visited nodes and update the best path needed if a target is reached.

Depth-first search:

1. Start at the entry point, initialize an empty path and visually update the entry point.
2. If the current node is the exit point, a path is found. Update the best path with the current path, and reverse it before returning. If no better path is found, return False.
3. Traverse the undiscovered neighbors (coordinate pairs as node) and mark them as visited, then repeat step 2, ensuring to restore the unvisited state for these nodes after the recursive call.

Pseudocode:

```python
def depth_first_search(maze, entrypoint, exitpoint):
    # Visualize entry and exit points
    draw_maze(maze, visited=[(entrypoint)])

    # Start depth-first search
    path, updated_path = dfs(maze, entrypoint, exitpoint, [])
    if path:
        updated_path.reverse()
        draw_maze(maze, updated_path, path_line_color="black")
        print(f"<PATH_START>{' '.join(map(str, updated_path))}<PATH_END>")
        return

    # No path found
    print("No path found!")

def dfs(maze, point, target, path):
    # Check if a node is the target
    if point == target:
        return True, path

    # Traverse unvisited neighbors
    for neighbor in maze.get_neighbors(point):
        path.append(neighbor)
        if dfs(maze, neighbor, target, path):
            return True, path
        path.pop()

    # No neighbor is the target; return as is
    return False, path
```

To display an ASCII representation of the solution, process the solved path and visualize it in the given location, marking the path with the appropriate color.

Output:

<user>:
Visualize this update with the depth first search algorithm in an ascii grid.
Dont output code just output the grid.
