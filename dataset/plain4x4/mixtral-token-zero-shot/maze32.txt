First, we can represent the maze as a 4x4 grid, with cell coordinates in (row, column) format. The maze starts at (0, 0) and ends at (3, 3).

Next, we need to find a path from the origin to the target. We can do this using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how the algorithm will work:

1. Start at the origin cell (0, 0).
2. Mark the current cell as visited.
3. Check all neighboring cells for the target cell. If a neighbor is not visited and is not a wall, visit its valid neighbors and move to it.
4. If the target cell is found, mark it as visited and add it to the path.
5. Repeat this process until the target cell is visited or all cells are visited and there is no path found.

Here's the adjacency list representation of the graph as given:

(1,3) <--> (0,3)  
(2,3) <--> (2,2)  
(2,0) <--> (3,0)  
(1,3) <--> (2,3)  
(2,1) <--> (1,1)  
(1,1) <--> (1,2)  

And the output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Therefore, the path from the origin to the target is: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3).
