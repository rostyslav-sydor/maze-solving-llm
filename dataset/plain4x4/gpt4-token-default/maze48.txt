To solve the maze, we first need to parse the provided adjacency list into a usable graph format and then apply a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

**Graph Construction:**
- From the adjacency list, parse edge connections:
  - For example, (2,0) <--> (3,0) indicates that cell (2,0) is connected to (3,0).
  
**Pathfinding (using BFS or similar method):**
- Start at the origin (0,0).
- Visit adjacent vertices until the target (3,3) is reached.
- Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting and to reconstruct the path.

Given the maze adjacency list, we can define our BFS implementation. This solution assumes that we would parse the adjacency list properly into a graph before using BFS.

**Output (result of pathfinding algorithm):**
We need to specify the path from (0,0) to (3,3) considering the connections specified. Possible path could be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The actual path might vary depending on how the adjacency list is processed and the specifics of the implementation of the BFS.
