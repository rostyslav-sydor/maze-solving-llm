To find a path in the given maze, we first interpret the adjacency list and then apply a standard graph traversal algorithm (BFS in this case) from the origin to the target. 

The maze adjacency list provided indicates how each point in the maze is connected to neighboring points. From this list, the graph can be constructed, where nodes represent coordinates and edges represent direct paths between those coordinates. Let's solve the maze:

1. First, we create the graph from adjacency list:
   - (3,1) <-> (3,2) , (1,1) <-> (0,1) , (2,1) <-> (1,1) ,
   - (1,0) <-> (1,1) , (3,2) <-> (3,3) , (1,2) <-> (2,2) ,
   - (2,0) <-> (1,0) , (0,0) <-> (0,1) , (3,0) <-> (2,0) ,
   - (2,3) <-> (1,3) , (1,2) <-> (0,2) , (0,3) <-> (1,3) ,
   - (2,2) <-> (3,2) , (3,0) <-> (3,1) , (3,3) <-> (2,3) .

2. Then, using Breadth-First Search (BFS), a shortest path from the origin (0,0) to target (3,3) is searched.
  
The BFS algorithm for this graph will yield a solution path that is one of the shortest paths through the nodes:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from the origin to the target, following valid connections listed in the adjacency list.
