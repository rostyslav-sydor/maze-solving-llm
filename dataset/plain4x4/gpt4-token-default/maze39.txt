To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list and identify a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using a typical pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Based on the adjacency relations described, we will use BFS for clarity and step-wise pathfinding.

**Adjacency List Interpretation:**
- (0,0) -> (0,1)
- (0,1) -> (0,2), (1,1)
- (0,2) -> (1,2)
- (1,0) -> (2,0)
- (1,1) -> (2,1)
- (1,2) -> (2,2)
- (1,3) -> (0,3)
- (2,0) -> (3,0)
- (2,1) -> (3,1)
- (2,2) -> (2,3)
- (2,3) -> (1,3), (3,3)
- (3,0) -> (3,1)
- (3,1) -> 
- (3,2) -> (3,3)
- (3,3) -> 
- (0,3) -> 

**BFS Algorithm Operation starting from (0,0):**
1. Start at (0,0), enqueue the node, mark it visited.
2. Explore (0,1).
3. From (0,1), explore (0,2).
4. From (0,2), explore (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move to (2,2).
6. From (2,2), go to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), directly move to (3,3), which is the target.

**Path Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
