To solve the maze, we need to construct a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). We'll start by building a graph using the adjacency list provided and then apply a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the shortest route from the origin to the destination.

Here's the adjacency list simplified:
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)
- (2,1) <--> (3,1)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)

Let's trace the steps from (0,0) to (3,3):
1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (0,1)
3. Move to (0,2)
4. Move to (1,2)
5. Move to (2,2)
6. Move to (2,3)
7. Move to (1,3)
8. Move to (0,3)
9. Move back to (0,2)
10. Move through the path: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2)
11. Reach (3,3)

Given the various routes possible due to connections, the most straightforward path following the adjacency list while minimizing steps is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path utilizes the provided connections efficiently to navigate from the origin to the destination.
