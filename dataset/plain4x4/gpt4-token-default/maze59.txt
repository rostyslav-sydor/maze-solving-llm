To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we need to create a representation of the graph and perform a pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Given the adjacency list:
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)

Starting from the origin (0,0) and exploring the neighbors, following the connections described, it is possible to navigate through the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates represents one of the possible paths from the origin to the target using the connections given in the adjacency list.
