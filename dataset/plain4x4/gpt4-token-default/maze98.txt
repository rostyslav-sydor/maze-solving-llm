To solve the maze, I'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm which is efficient for shortest path finding in unweighted graphs like this.

**Parsing the input**:

The adjacency list for the maze translates into:
- `(1,0)` is connected to `(1,1)`
- `(3,3)` is connected to `(3,2)`
- `(3,1)` is connected to `(3,2)`
- `(2,3)` is connected to `(3,3)`
- `(3,0)` is connected to `(2,0)`
- `(2,2)` is connected to `(1,2)`
- `(2,1)` is connected to `(2,0)`
- `(3,1)` is connected to `(3,0)`
- `(0,3)` is connected to `(1,3)`
- `(0,1)` is connected to `(1,1)`
- `(0,1)` is connected to `(0,2)`
- `(0,3)` is connected to `(0,2)`
- `(0,0)` is connected to `(1,0)`
- `(2,2)` is connected to `(2,3)`
- `(1,2)` is connected to `(1,3)`

**Entry and Exit**:
- Entry `(0,0)`
- Exit `(3,3)`

**BFS Implementation**:
1. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level, starting from the entry point.
2. Maintain a map to keep track of each node's parent for path reconstruction.
3. Once the exit is reached, reconstruct the path from exit to entry using the parent map.

**Simplified Path Reconstruction**:
  - Start BFS from `(0,0)`
  - Trace path once `(3,3)` is reached.

Let's provide the output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves right and down while satisfying the adjacency constraints of the maze, culminating in the exit point `(3,3)`.
