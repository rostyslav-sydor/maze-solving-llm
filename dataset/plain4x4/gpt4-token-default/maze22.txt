To solve this maze, we'll convert the adjacency list into a graphical representation and then use a search algorithm to find the path from the origin to the target.

First, let's form the graph based on the given adjacency list. The conversion would be as follows:

```
(0,3) <-> (0,2) ; (1,0) <-> (2,0) ; (1,1) <-> (1,0) ; (2,3) <-> (3,3) ; (2,3) <-> (1,3) ; (0,2) <-> (1,2) ; (3,0) <-> (3,1) ; (2,2) <-> (3,2) ; (3,2) <-> (3,1) ; (3,0) <-> (2,0) ; (2,3) <-> (2,2) ; (2,1) <-> (2,2) ; (0,2) <-> (0,1) ; (1,3) <-> (1,2) ; (0,1) <-> (0,0).
```

Using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm which is well-suited for unweighted graphs like this (finding the shortest path):

- Start at the origin point (0,0).
- Explore neighbors and keep track of visited points and the path taken.
- Continue exploring until we find the target (3,3).

Upon searching, we find the path:

```
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```

Thus, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
