The representation provided is an adjacency list of a graph where each node is a coordinate (row, column) of the maze. Each node is connected to its directly adjacent nodes (if no wall is present between them). The origin is marked at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).

Here's a step-by-step path from (0,0) to (3,3) based on the connectivity provided:

1. Starting at (0,0), we can move to (0,1) because there's a direct connection.
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), move to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), move directly to (3,3).

Thus, the path is a sequence from the starting point to the endpoint through available paths. Here is the solution string formatted as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
