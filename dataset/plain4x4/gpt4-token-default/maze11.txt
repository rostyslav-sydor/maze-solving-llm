To solve the maze, I will analyze the adjacency list to create a graph and implement a pathfinding solution, using a breadth-first search (BFS) from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

By reviewing the graph from the adjacency list:
- Connections for each node (coordinate) indicate simply the possible paths between points in the maze.

Starting BFS from (0,0), I will trace a path towards (3,3) using the adjacency rules given.

The solution path obtained using a simple BFS strategy from (0,0) to (3,3) via available paths is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This traverse follows the available connections: (0,0) -> (0,1), (0,1) -> (0,2), (0,2) -> (1,2), (1,2) -> (1,3), (1,3) -> (2,3), and finally, (2,3) -> (3,3). This path ensures all moves are legal according to the adjacency definitions given and reaches the target efficiently.
