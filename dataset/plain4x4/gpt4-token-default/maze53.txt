To find the solution path through the maze from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using the adjacency list provided:

1. Create the graph as a mapping of each node to its connected nodes. 
2. Implement a path-finding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to traverse from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

Here's the possible path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path was constructed step-by-step by moving through each coordinate, checking the adjacency list to ensure there was a valid connection between each step, and using a straightforward traversal method that prioritizes reaching the target.
