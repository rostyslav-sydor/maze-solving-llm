To solve the maze given as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I will perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for such tasks in maze-like structures or graphs. Let's briefly explain how BFS works and then apply it to get the sequence of steps from the start to the end point.

Here's how BFS works:
1. Start from the origin, adding it to a queue.
2. Explore all directly connected rooms (or nodes), adding them to the queue if they haven't been visited.
3. Mark each visited room to avoid revisiting.
4. Track the path by remembering the predecessor of each visited node.
5. Continue until you reach the target room.
6. Backtrack from the target to the origin using the predecessors to get the full path.

Applying BFS:

<ADJLIST_START> (3,1) <--> (3,0); (0,2) <--> (0,3); (3,3) <--> (3,2); (1,2) <--> (2,2); (2,1) <--> (3,1); (0,0) <--> (0,1); (1,2) <--> (0,2); (0,0) <--> (1,0); (1,0) <--> (1,1); (2,3) <--> (3,3); (2,1) <--> (2,0); (0,3) <--> (1,3); (3,1) <--> (3,2); (1,1) <--> (1,2); (1,3) <--> (2,3); <ADJLIST_END>

<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Start the search from (0,0). Using BFS, you discover paths and find the way to (3,3) through connected nodes. The resulting path, from my graph traversal:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows the sequence of moves directly derived from BFS traversal which ensures reaching from the origin to the target as described in the adjacency list.
