To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we'll search for a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here's the approach to solve it based on the provided adjacency list:

1. Parse the adjacency list to a graph representation (`dict` of neighbors).
2. Use a search algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS) to find a path between the origin and the target.

Here's a solution to the adjacency graph:

1. Starting at point (0,0), we look for its neighbors.
2. From there, follow a valid path that connects to the destination by exploring neighboring connections, ensuring to only progress to points not visited before.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify that a potential valid path is:
- Start from (0,0)
- Move to (0,1) 
- Then to (0,2)
- Continue to (0,3)
- Proceed to (1,3)
- Move downward to (2,3)
- And then to (3,3), which is the target.

Output this path with the specified token format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
