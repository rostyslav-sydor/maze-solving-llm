To solve the maze outlined in the provided adjacency list, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this. The adjacency list provided represents connections between nodes or coordinates in the maze. The entry point of the maze is (0,0) and the exit is (3,3).

Here are the steps transcribed into action and the output format requested:

1. Interpret and translate the adjacency list into a usable format like `dict` or `map` where each key (node) has its directly reachable nodes (neighbors) listed.
2. Start BFS from the entry point (0,0) by adding it to a queue.
3. Track visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times and to avoid cycles.
4. For each node processed, check all its neighbors; if the neighbor is the exit, reconstruct the path using the predecessors recorded during traversal.
5. Continue this until the queue is empty or the exit is found.
6. Finally, format the found path into the specified output format.

Assuming BFS was employed and executed properly from the entry to the exit point, the resulting path from (0,0) to (3,3) would appear as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path showcases a plausible route from the entry to the exit through the maze based on the adjacency connections provided, assuming no obstacles other than those implicitly created by the absence of direct connections between some nodes in the list.
