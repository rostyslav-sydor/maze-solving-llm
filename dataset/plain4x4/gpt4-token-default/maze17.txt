To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, I'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. First, I will parse and represent the adjacency list as a graph, then apply BFS starting from the origin, tracking visited nodes to find the shortest path to the target.

**Graph Representation:**
- Nodes are given as coordinates.
- Neighbors for each node are directly mentioned in adjacency, e.g., (1,2) <--> (1,3) involves neighbors (1,2) and (1,3).

**BFS for Pathfinding:**
- Starting from the origin, explore all connected nodes using a queue for BFS.
- Keep track of each node’s parent to reconstruct the path.

**Execution:**
1. Define the adjacency list as input.
2. Parse and convert into a usable graph format.
3. Implement BFS from the origin (0,0).
4. Reconstruct and print the path from origin to target (3,3).

**Output Path:**
Given BFS and the adjacency relationships and considering valid BFS operation on the parsed graph data, a determined path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3) would be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
