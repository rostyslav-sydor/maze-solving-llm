To solve the maze from (0,0) to (3,3), we will utilize the adjacency list provided to trace the shortest path. We'll first reconstruct the adjacency list into a format that allows for breadth-first search (BFS):

Adjacency list:
- (0,0) connects to [(0,1), (1,0)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,3), (1,2)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2)]
- (1,0) connects to [(0,0), (2,0)]
- (1,1) connects to [(1,2), (2,1)]
- (1,2) connects to [(1,1), (1,3), (0,2)]
- (1,3) connects to [(1,2), (2,3)]
- (2,0) connects to [(1,0), (3,0)]
- (2,1) connects to [(2,2), (1,1)]
- (2,2) connects to [(2,1), (2,3)]
- (2,3) connects to [(2,2), (1,3), (3,3)]
- (3,0) connects to [(2,0), (3,1)]
- (3,1) connects to [(3,0), (3,2)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,1), (3,3)]
- (3,3) connects to [(3,2), (2,3)]

Using BFS, the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path directly connects successive nodes that are adjacent per the adjacency relation given initially, ensuring the traversal through the maze from start to exit.
