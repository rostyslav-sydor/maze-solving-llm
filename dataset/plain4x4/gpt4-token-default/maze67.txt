To solve the maze, we can model it as a graph and perform a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Given the adjacency list:
- We can convert this into a more manageable format, such as a dictionary mapping each node to its neighbors.
- Then, we execute BFS from the origin until we reach the target, keeping track of visited nodes and the paths taken.
  
Here's a simplified explanation followed by the solution:

1. Parse the adjacency list to build the graph.
2. Implement BFS keeping track of the path to backtrack once the target is found.

Executing the BFS would give us the following path:
- Start at (0,0), move directly down and right as given by the possible moves in the adjacency list.
- The path from (0,0) to (3,3) would be: up from (0,0) to (0,1), continue to (0,2) and (0,3), shift to (1,3), proceed to (2,3), and finally take the last segment from (2,3) to (3,3).

Thus, the answer in the required format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
