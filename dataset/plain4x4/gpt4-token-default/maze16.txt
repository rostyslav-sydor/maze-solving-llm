To find a solution to navigate the maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), we use the provided adjacency list to construct potential paths. The adjacency list represents the connections between nodes (coordinates) in the maze.

From examining connections in the list:

1. Start at (0,0), which connects to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) move to (0,2).
3. From (0,2) move to (0,3).
4. From (0,3) move to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) move to (2,3).
6. From (2,3) move to (3,3), the exit point.

This path provides a valid route through the maze via the linked nodes:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
