To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using the connections specified.

The maze's edges are:
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (1,2) <-> (2,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,0) <-> (2,1)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)

Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` can be found.

Here is a valid path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path successfully connects the origin to the target while respecting the adjacency rules set out in the list.
