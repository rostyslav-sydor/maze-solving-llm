To solve the given maze represented as an adjacency list, I will use a search method, commonly BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search), to discover a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Based on adjacency list representation provided:

1. Parse the adjacency list to reconstruct the graph.
2. Apply BFS/DFS starting from (0,0), visiting nodes until reaching (3,3).
3. Track the path using predecessor links.

After parsing and applying a BFS (since it is typically better for shortest path searching in unweighted graphs like this one):

Path by BFS:
- (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

This path successfully traverses from the entry to the exit point, moving systematically through nodes that are connected directly as per adjacency list.

Formatted from start to end point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
