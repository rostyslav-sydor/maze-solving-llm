To solve the maze given the adjacency list, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming to reach the target (3,3).

Based on the adjacency list, we will reconstruct the graph as a dictionary in Python, invoke BFS, and then trace the shortest path back using the parent pointers established during BFS. Here’s the simplified solution:

1. **Construct the Graph**:
   ```python
   graph = {
       (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)],
       (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)],
       (0,3): [(0,2), (1,3)],
       (1,0): [(2,0)],
       (1,1): [(1,2), (2,1)],
       (1,2): [(1,1), (1,3)],
       (1,3): [(1,2), (2,3), (0,3)],
       (2,0): [(1,0), (3,0)],
       (2,1): [(3,1), (1,1)],
       (2,2): [(2,3), (3,2)],
       (2,3): [(1,3), (2,2)],
       (3,0): [(2,0), (3,1)],
       (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
       (3,2): [(3,1), (3,3)],
       (3,3): [(3,2)]
   }
   ```

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   ```python
   from collections import deque

   def bfs(start, end, graph):
       queue = deque([start])
       visited = set([start])
       parent = {start: None}

       while queue:
           current = queue.popleft()
           if current == end:
               break
           for neighbor in graph[current]:
               if neighbor not in visited:
                   visited.add(neighbor)
                   parent[neighbor] = current
                   queue.append(neighbor)

       path = []
       step = end
       while step is not None:
           path.append(step)
           step = parent[step]
       path.reverse()
       return path
   ```

3. **Find the Path**:
   Using the above definitions and understanding of the algorithm, the response using our algorithm from (0,0) to (3,3) yields:

   ```python
   path = bfs((0,0), (3,3), graph)
   print(path)  # Outputs: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]
   ```

Hence, the solution to the maze between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
