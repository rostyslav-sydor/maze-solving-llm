To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, I have transformed the provided list into a graph structure and applied a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Given Maze Information:
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)
- Connections: 
  - (2,0) <--> (2,1)
  - (3,2) <--> (3,3)
  - and more...

Transformed into Graph (for clarity and analysis):
```
{
    (2,0): [(2,1), (3,0)],
    (2,1): [(2,0)],
    (3,2): [(3,3), (2,2), (3,1)],
    (3,3): [(3,2)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (2,2)],
    and more...
}
```
Using BFS on this graph structure starting from (0,0):

1. From (0,0), you can travel to (1,0) and then (0,1).
2. Continue exploring till all possible paths are covered or until the target (3,3) is reached.

BFS Search Result Path:
- Start at (0,0)
- Go to (1,0)
- Go to (1,1)
- Go to (1,2)
- Reach (2,2), then (2,3), and then (1,3)
- Go to (0,3), then (0,2)
- Finally reach (3,2) and then (3,3)

Therefore, the solution path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path provides a sequence of moves from the start to the end of the maze ensuring every necessary connection is followed as per the adjacency relationship defined.
