To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). Here's how we can traverse:

- Start at (0,0), which directly connects to (1,0).
- From (1,0), move to (1,1).
- Continue from (1,1) to (1,2).
- Move next to (2,2) from (1,2).
- From (2,2), head to (2,1).
- Proceed from (2,1) to (2,0).
- Continue from (2,0) to (3,0).
- Move from (3,0) to (3,1).
- From (3,1), head to (3,2).
- Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3), reaching the destination.

Here is the resultant path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
