To solve the maze, I will first interpret the adjacency list to create a graph and then use a searching algorithm to find the path from the origin to the target. The adjacency list provided indicates the connections between nodes (coordinates in this case).

Adjacency List:
- (2,2) <-> (1,2), (2,2) <-> (3,2)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0), (2,1) <-> (2,0)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3), (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1), (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,1) <-> (2,1)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)

Using Breadth-First Search or a similar method for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this, I deduced the shortest path to be the following:

Path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

Formatted output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
