To solve the maze, I interpreted the adjacency list to establish the possible movement paths between points. Based on your description, the origin (starting) point of the maze is (0,0) and the target (ending) point is (3,3).

I then applied a graph traversal algorithm (like Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. Given that this is a programming-related task, I'm expressing a theoretical solution approach rather than the specific computational steps or output that result from running actual code.

Taking into account the connections and mapping the shortest path from the adjacency list:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (1,0) - connected to (0,0)
3. Move to (1,1) - connected to (1,0)
4. Move to (1,2) - connected to (1,1)
5. Move to (2,2) - connected to (1,2)
6. Move to (2,3) - connected to (2,2)
7. Move to (3,3) - connected to (2,3)

Hence, the solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
