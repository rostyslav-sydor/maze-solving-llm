To solve the maze, I first need to reconstruct the graph from the adjacency list provided, identify the shortest path between the origin and target locations provided, and finally format the solution in the required format.

1. The adjacency pairs provided indicate that:
   - Each point `(a, b)` has one or more neighbors `(c, d)` such that both points have direct paths between them.

2. Using the origins and targets:
   - Origin: `(0,0)`
   - Target: `(3,3)`

3. Using a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) can find the shortest path between two points in an unweighted graph like this one.

4. Performing BFS from the origin `(0,0)`, we can explore all possible paths through linked neighbors until we reach the target `(3,3)`.

5. Constructing the shortest path found:

```
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```

6. Provide the formatted output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is the result of following the BFS traversal, which ensures the shortest path is selected based on adjacency relations provided by the challenge.
