To solve the maze, we follow these steps:

1. Interpret the adjacency list to create a graph representation.
2. Apply Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the origin to find the shortest path to the target.
3. Record the steps along the path from the origin to the target.

From the provided adjacency list, here's the relevant path:

**Origin:** (0,0)  
**Target:** (3,3)  
**Moves in Maze:**
- Start at (0,0), move to (1,0).
- From (1,0), move to (2,0).
- From (2,0), move to (3,0).
- From (3,0), move to (3,1).
- From (3,1), move to (3,2).
- From (3,2), move to (3,3).

Thus, the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
