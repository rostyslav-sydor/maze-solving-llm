To solve the maze represented by the provided adjacency list, we'll first parse the adjacency list structure, then compute the shortest path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

From the adjacency list, we can deduce the graph structure:

- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,0) <--> (3,0)

Based on this structure, starting the BFS from the origin (0,0), we'll generate paths and keep track of visited nodes until we reach the target (3,3).

Computing the path and checking for shortest paths through all possible connections, the following path is a valid solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence provides a clear progression from start to exit, based on connections from the adjacency list provided.
