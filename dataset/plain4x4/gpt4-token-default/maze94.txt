To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we'll start by constructing a map from the connections provided. We want to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

First, let's interpret the adjacency list:
- (0,1) ↔ (0,2)
- (0,0) ↔ (1,0)
- (1,0) ↔ (2,0)
- (2,0) ↔ (3,0)
- (0,1) ↔ (1,1)
- (1,1) ↔ (1,2)
- (1,2) ↔ (1,3)
- (1,3) ↔ (0,3)
- (1,3) ↔ (2,3)
- (2,3) ↔ (2,2)
- (2,2) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,2) ↔ (3,3)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,1) ↔ (2,1)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,0)

Using these edges, we can use a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3).

Creating a simplistic code:
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def add_edge(graph, a, b):
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)

def bfs(graph, start, goal):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    parent = {}
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node == goal:
            break
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] = node
    # Track back the path
    path = []
    step = goal
    while step in parent:
        path.append(step)
        step = parent[step]
    path.append(start)
    return path[::-1]

graph = defaultdict(list)
edges = [((0,2), (0,1)), ((0,0), (1,0)),...]
for a, b in edges:
    add_edge(graph, a, b)

path = bfs(graph, (0,0), (3,3))
```

Following the determined path:
```
(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)
```
Hence, the answer would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
