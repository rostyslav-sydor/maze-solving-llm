To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list by converting it into a more usable graph format, identifying the start (origin) and end (target) points, and then applying a search algorithm to find a path.

1. **Adjacency List Interpretation**: The graph described shows connections between adjacent cells in the maze.
2. **Identify Entry and Exit Points**: Entry at (0,0) and exit at (3,3).
3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) for finding the shortest path.

Let's execute the BFS:

- Start from `(0,0)`, enqueue with initial path `[ (0,0) ]`.
- Explore its neighbors `(1,0)`; enqueue `[ (0,0), (1,0) ]`.
- From `(1,0)`, move to `(1,1)`; enqueue `[ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ]`.
- Move to `(2,0)`; enqueue `[ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]`.
- From `(2,0)`, move to `(2,1)`, then to `(3,1)`; enqueue `[ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1) ]`.
- From `(3,1)`, move to `(3,2)`; enqueue `[ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ]`.
- Finally, from `(3,2)` to the target `(3,3)`; path = `[ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) ]`.

The complete path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` is found:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
