To solve the maze, we will follow the adjacency list provided and find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

**Step-by-Step Path Finding:**
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0) (as both are connected).
3. From (1,0), move to (2,0) (connected).
4. From (2,0), go to (3,0) (connected).
5. From (3,0), move to (3,1), then to (3,2), and finally to (3,3) (all consecutive connections in adjacency list).

So, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) in coordinate list format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path contains successive and direct connections based on the adjacency list provided, leading from the entry to the exit point effectively.
