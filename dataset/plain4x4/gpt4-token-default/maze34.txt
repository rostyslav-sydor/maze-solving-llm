To solve the maze defined by the adjacency list and to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we convert the graph into a traversable format and use an algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here's the maze traversal:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Check all directly connected nodes to (0,0), which are:
   - (1,0)
   - (0,1)
3. Explore from these nodes in a similar breadth-first manner until reaching the target (3,3).

Using BFS, we find the following shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates traces a valid route following the adjacency rules provided, ensuring each move connects directly to the next maze cell, leading from the designated origin to the target location.
