The maze is represented as an adjacency list where each pair of coordinates indicates a bi-directional path between two points in a 2D grid.

Here is one possible path from the start point (0, 0) to the end point (3, 3):

1. Start from (0,0) and head right to (1,0)
2. From (1,0), move up vertically to (1,1)
3. From (1,1), continue to move up to (1,2)
4. From (1,2), go right to (1,3)
5. From (1,3), go down to (2,3)
6. From (2,3), move right to (2,2)
7. From (2,2), move up to (3,2)
8. From (3,2), continue left to (3,1)
9. From (3,1), go further left to (3,0)
10. From (3,0), finally move right to end at (3,3)

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>
