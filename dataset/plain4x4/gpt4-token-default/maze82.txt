To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using the connections provided in the adjacency list. The maze can be represented as a graph, and the path can be found using a simple graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

First, I'll parse the adjacency list into a usable graph format (dictionary of lists), establish the origin and target, and then apply BFS to determine the shortest path from the origin to the target in this unweighted graph. Here's the parsed adjacency graph and the BFS application:

Graph Representation:
```python
maze_graph = {
    "(0,0)": ["(1,0)", "(0,1)"],
    "(1,0)": ["(0,0)", "(2,0)"],
    "(2,0)": ["(1,0)", "(3,0)"],
    "(3,0)": ["(2,0)", "(3,1)"],
    "(1,1)": ["(2,1)", "(1,2)"],
    "(2,1)": ["(1,1)", "(2,2)"],
    "(2,2)": ["(2,1)", "(3,2)"],
    "(3,1)": ["(3,0)", "(3,2)"],
    "(3,2)": ["(2,2)", "(3,1)", "(3,3)"],
    "(1,3)": ["(0,3)", "(1,2)"],
    "(3,3)": ["(3,2)", "(2,3)"],
    "(0,1)": ["(0,0)", "(0,2)"],
    "(2,3)": ["(3,3)"],
    "(1,2)": ["(1,1)", "(1,3)"],
    "(0,3)": ["(1,3)", "(0,2)"],
    "(0,2)": ["(0,3)", "(0,1)"]
}
```
Using BFS starting from "(0,0)" trying to reach "(3,3)", the path found is:

Path: `"[(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)]"`
 
Formatted Output:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
