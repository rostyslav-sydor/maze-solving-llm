To solve the maze, we translate the adjacency list into a more manageable form of data, i.e., a graph, where each node represents a coordinate in the maze and each edge shows direct connectivity between these coordinates.

For the provided maze, we have:

Vertices (nodes) represent coordinates, and edges represent connectivity:
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,0) <--> (0,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)

Entry is at (0,0) and exit is at (3,3). 

To find a path from (0,0) to (3,3), a breadth-first search (BFS) can efficiently provide the shortest path due to its suitability for unweighted graphs like this maze.

The solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through available connections, ensuring travel from the origin to the destination based on the given maze's layout.
