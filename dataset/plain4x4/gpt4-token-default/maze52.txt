To solve the maze, we start by parsing the adjacency list to create a graph representation and then use a search algorithm (like BFS) to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Here’s a direct solution after reformatting and analyzing the adjacency list, and performing a search:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path was derived by examining available connections in the adjacency list, ensuring each step is connected to the following until the target is reached. Initially moving vertically and later shifting to horizontal moves based on available routes, ensuring not to revisit nodes unless required for a valid path.
