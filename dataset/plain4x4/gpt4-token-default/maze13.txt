To solve the maze depicted by the adjacency list and find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can interpret the problem as a graph traversal, using either a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) technique to find the shortest path.

Given the adjacency list, I will list the connections as edges:

1. (1,3) <--> (2,3)
2. (3,3) <--> (3,2)
3. (2,2) <--> (2,3)
4. (1,2) <--> (1,3)
5. (2,2) <--> (3,2)
6. (1,1) <--> (1,0)
7. (1,2) <--> (0,2)
8. (3,0) <--> (3,1)
9. (2,1) <--> (1,1)
10. (3,1) <--> (2,1)
11. (3,0) <--> (2,0)
12. (0,1) <--> (0,2)
13. (0,0) <--> (0,1)
14. (1,3) <--> (0,3)
15. (1,0) <--> (0,0)

Starting from the origin (0,0), we can trace the vertices using breadth-first search on the graph with directed edges to determine the shortest path to (3,3). The path leading from the origin to the destination in this case is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path was deduced by linking consecutive nodes where each is accessible directly from its predecessor according to the maze's adjacency representation, ensuring the shortest route is followed.
