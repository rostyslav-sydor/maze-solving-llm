To solve the maze given as an adjacency list, we start by reconstructing the graph. We want to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 

Using the adjacency list and applying a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), we determine the shortest path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
