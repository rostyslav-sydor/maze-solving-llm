To solve this maze, I will use Python code to simulate finding a path between the entry point `(0,0)` and the exit point `(3,3)` using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm due to its unweighted shortest path finding capability.

Firstly, I will parse the adjacency list that describes the maze connections, create an appropriate graph data structure, and then find a path from the start to the target node by BFS.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Maze given as adjacency list
adj_list = [
    ((3,2), (3,3)), ((1,3), (2,3)), ((1,2), (1,1)), ((0,1), (0,0)), ((3,1), (3,0)), 
    ((2,2), (2,1)), ((1,0), (0,0)), ((0,2), (0,1)), ((3,0), (2,0)), ((2,3), (3,3)), 
    ((0,3), (1,3)), ((1,2), (1,3)), ((2,1), (3,1)), ((2,0), (1,0)), ((0,2), (1,2))
]

# Convert to graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
for a, b in adj_list:
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)

# BFS parameters
start = (0,0)
end = (3,3)
queue = deque([start])
visited = {start}
parents = {}

# Conduct BFS
while queue:
    current = queue.popleft()
    if current == end:
        break
    for neighbor in graph[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            queue.append(neighbor)
            visited.add(neighbor)
            parents[neighbor] = current

# Reconstruct path
path = [end]
while path[-1] != start:
    path.append(parents[path[-1]])

path.reverse()

# Print output
print("<PATH_START>", " ".join(str(x) for x in path), "<PATH_END>")
```

This Python code effectively calculates and prints the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). It uses BFS for its simplicity and efficiency in unweighted graphs like this maze. Running this code would yield the desired path expressed in the specified format.
