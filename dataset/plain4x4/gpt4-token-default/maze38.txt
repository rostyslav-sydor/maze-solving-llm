To find a solution for the maze represented by the provided adjacency list, we need to map out a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using the connections given between various coordinates.

First, we need to recreate the graph from the adjacency list data and then use a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the valid path from the origin to the target.

Upon careful analysis or through algorithmic generation, here is one possible path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through connected nodes, moving from the bottom-left corner of the maze to the top-right corner, ensuring all moves are between directly connected nodes as defined in the adjacency list.
