To solve the maze provided, I will consider it as a traversal problem where we need to find a path from the origin to the target, treating nodes as coordinates and edges as pathways. The adjacency list provides the connectivity between nodes.

Given:
- **Origin:** (0,0)
- **Target:** (3,3)

Using the adjacency list provided, we can construct a directional path by finding a route through the connected nodes from the origin to the target.

Considering the provided adjacency and by navigating the maze, a possible solution would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves:
- from (0,0) to (1,0)
- then vertically to (1,1)
- horizontally towards (2,1)
- moving up through (3,1) to (3,2)
- and finally reaching the target (3,3).

This path is a valid traversal across the available connections in the adjacency list.
