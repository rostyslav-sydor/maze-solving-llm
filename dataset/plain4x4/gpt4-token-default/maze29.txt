To find a solution path through the described maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), I will analyze the given adjacency list and utilize a suitable pathfinding algorithm, such as BFS.

1. Reconstructing the graph from the provided adjacency list:
   ```
   {
    (0,0): [(1,0), (0,1)],
    (0,1): [(0,0), (1,1)],
    (0,2): [(0,3), (1,2)],
    (0,3): [(0,2), (1,3)],
    (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)],
    (1,1): [(1,2), (0,1)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (1,1)],
    (1,3): [(0,3), (2,3), (1,2)],
    (2,0): [(1,0), (2,1)],
    (2,1): [(2,0), (3,1)],
    (2,2): [(3,2)],
    (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
    (3,0): [(3,1)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,2): [(3,1), (2,2), (3,3)],
    (3,3): [(3,2), (2,3)]
   }
   ```
   
2. Implement BFS (Breadth-First Search) from the start point (0,0) to target point (3,3):
   ```
   From (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3).
   ```
   
3. Format the path in the requested output:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

This path has been determined based on a connected and valid route through the graph from the specified origin to the target location.
