To find a solution, we first convert the adjacency list information into a more manageable format for pathfinding. We'll utilize a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. The adjacency list represents edges in an undirected graph where each coordinate pair represents a node connected to another node. 

Using the adjacency list:
- Start at `(0,0)`, move options can be to `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, move options are `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`.
- From `(0,2)`, move options are `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`, and `(1,2)`.
- From `(0,3)`, move options are `(0,2)` and `(1,3)`.
- Continue this pattern to identify possible moves from each coordinate until reaching `(3,3)`.

Let's trace one potential path:
1. Start at `(0,0)`.
2. Move to `(0,1)`.
3. Continue to `(0,2)`.
4. Then, go to `(0,3)`.
5. Move to `(1,3)`.
6. Then, go to `(2,3)`.
7. Finally, reach `(3,3)`.

Given the above steps, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
