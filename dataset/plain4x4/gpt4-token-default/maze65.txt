To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the specified origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. The direct connections for each coordinate are given, which describe which cells are accessible from each other.

Using these details, and considering a typical approach like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for navigating shortest paths in an unweighted graph, here's a step-by-step solution from the origin to the target.

1. Start at `(0,0)`.
2. Move to `(1,0)` (from adjacency: `(1,0) <--> (0,0)`).
3. Proceed to `(2,0)` (from adjacency: `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`).
4. Move next to `(2,1)` (from adjacency: `(2,0) <--> (2,1)`).
5. Then, move to `(1,1)` (from adjacency: `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`).
6. Continue to `(1,2)` (from adjacency: `(1,2) <--> (1,1)`).
7. Next, to `(1,3)` (from adjacency: `(1,2) <--> (1,3)`).
8. Move to `(2,3)` (from adjacency: `(1,3) <--> (2,3)`).
9. Proceed to `(3,3)` (final position, using the connection `(3,3) <--> (2,3)`).

Each step chooses a pathway through the maze using directly-connected neighboring cells. Here's the path output within required specification:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
