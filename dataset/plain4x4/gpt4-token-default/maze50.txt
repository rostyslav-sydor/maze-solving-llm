To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list, I will use a search algorithm to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. Let's parse the adjacency list and apply a breadth-first search (BFS) method since it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this one.

**Adjacency List Parsing:**
From the provided details, here are the connectivity relationships of the maze:
- (2,1) connected to (1,1) and (2,0)
- (3,1) connected to (3,0) and (3,2)
- (1,3) connected to (2,3) and (0,3)
- (0,3) connected to (1,3) and (0,2)
- (2,1) connected to (2,0)
- (1,0) connected to (0,0)
- (1,2) connected to (0,2)
- (3,3) connected to (2,3)
- (0,1) connected to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (3,0) connected to (2,0)
- (2,2) connected to (2,3) and (3,2)
- (3,1) connected to (3,2)
- (0,3) connected to (0,2)
- (0,1) connected to (0,2)

**Solution using BFS:**
Starting at `(0,0)`, the BFS expands through its connections: 

Final and shortest path: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This follows the path via row 0, then straight from the west of the maze to the east at row 3.
