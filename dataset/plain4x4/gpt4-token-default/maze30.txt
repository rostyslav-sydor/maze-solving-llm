To solve the maze provided, I will first convert the adjacency list into a more usable data structure for pathfinding, specifically a graph where each node represents a coordinate in the maze, and edges connect nodes that are reachable from one another.

From the adjacency description given:
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (0,3)
- (2,3) is connected to (1,3) and (2,2)
- (3,2) is connected to (3,1) and (3,3)
- (1,1) is connected to (1,2) and (1,0)
- (2,2) is connected to (2,1)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,0)
- (3,0) is connected to (3,1)
- (1,3) is connected to (1,2)
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0)

The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3). Solving this using a BFS or DFS algorithm to find the shortest path:

BFS approach:
1. Start from (0,0).
2. Explore all directly connected nodes: (0,1), (1,0).
3. From (0,1), further explore to (0,2).
4. From (1,0), explore to (1,1) and (2,0).
5. From (1,1), go to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), head to (1,3) and (2,2).
7. Continue from (2,2) to (2,3).
8. From (2,3), connect to (3,3).

Combining steps yields the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
