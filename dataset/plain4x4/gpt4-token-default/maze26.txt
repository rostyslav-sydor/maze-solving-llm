To solve this maze, we will interpret the adjacency list to model the connections between different nodes (coordinates in the maze). The list gives us the bidirectional paths directly.

Given that the maze entry point (origin) is at (0,0) and the exit (target) is at (3,3), we can use a standard graph search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this:

1. Start BFS from node (0,0), marking it visited. We will maintain a queue that holds each node along with the path that led to it.
2. For every node, we explore its neighbors as provided in the adjacency list while ensuring not to revisit nodes.
3. We continue this process until we reach the target node (3,3) or until all possible paths are exhausted.

After processing, we produce the sequence of coordinates leading from (0,0) to (3,3), resulting in the shortest path (if multiple, any such path derived from the BFS exploration):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This output describes a valid path navigating through the maze from the given entry to the exit point.
