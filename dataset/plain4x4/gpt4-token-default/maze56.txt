To solve the given maze represented as an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). We can utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy since it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which perfectly matches the adjacency list representation of the maze.

From the adjacency list:

- Starting at (0,0), possible moves are to (0,1).
- From (0,1), you can go to (0,0) or (0,2).
- From (0,2), moves are to (0,1) or to (0,3).
- From (0,3), moves are to (0,2) or to (1,3).
- From (1,3), the move possibilities are (0,3), (2,3), or (1,2).
- From (1,2), you go to (1,3) or (1,1).
- From (1,1), moves are to (1,2) or (2,1).
- From (2,1), you can reach (1,1) or (3,1).
- From (2,3), you can reach (1,3) or (3,3).
- From (3,3), you've reached the target.

Thus, based on BFS, starting from (0,0) and connecting these moves leads us to the path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Formatted answer:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
