To solve the maze provided, we first parse the adjacency list data representing the maze's connectivity, identify the entry `(0,0)` and exit `(3,3)` points, and then apply a graph traversal algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), to find the shortest path between the entry and the exit.

Parsing the adjacency list and extracting the graph information:

- (1,0) connected to (2,0)
- (1,1) connected to (1,2)
- (2,1) connected to (3,1)
- (3,3) connected to (2,3) and (3,2)
- (0,1) connected to (0,0)
- (1,3) connected to (2,3) and (0,3)
- (0,2) connected to (0,3) and (0,1)
- (2,2) connected to (1,2) and (2,1)
- (3,0) connected to (2,0) and (3,1)
- (2,0) connected to (1,0) and (3,0)

Using these connections and performing a BFS to find the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`, the path traced would be:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Go to (0,1)
3. Go to (0,2)
4. Go to (0,3)
5. Go to (1,3)
6. Go to (2,3)
7. Go to (3,3)

This yields the following coordinates as the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
