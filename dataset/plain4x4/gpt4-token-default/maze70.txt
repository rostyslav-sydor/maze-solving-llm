To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list, then search for a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using an appropriate pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Maze Representation:**
1. Parse the provided adjacency list to build a graph:
   - Each coordinate pair represents a node.
   - Each connection (`<-->)` between pairs represents an undirected edge.

**Pathfinding:**
BFS is suitable as it finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all neighbors, then their neighbors, until the target (3,3) is reached or all paths are checked.

**Adjacency List (for reference in solving)**:
Given:
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- and so on...

**BFS Execution**:
- Begin at (0,0), and gradually expand to reachable nodes using the adjacency list until the destination (3,3) is reached.

**Solution Path**:
Upon successfully reaching the destination using BFS (found by implementing or simulating the described process):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path moves from the origin to the target, navigating through connected nodes as per the adjacency information provided.
