To solve the maze from the adjacency list provided, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Let's first parse the adjacency list to a more usable form:

Adjacency List:
(3,3) <-> (2,3)
(0,3) <-> (1,3)
(0,1) <-> (0,0)
(1,3) <-> (2,3)
(3,1) <-> (3,2)
(3,1) <-> (3,0)
(0,3) <-> (0,2)
(3,1) <-> (2,1)
(1,1) <-> (0,1)
(1,2) <-> (1,1)
(2,0) <-> (2,1)
(3,2) <-> (3,3)
(2,0) <-> (1,0)
(0,1) <-> (0,2)
(1,2) <-> (2,2)

Graph is:
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0), (0,2), (1,1)
- (0,2) connects to (0,1), (0,3)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2), (1,3)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) connects to (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3), (2,3)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0), (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0), (3,1)
- (2,2) connects to (1,2)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3), (3,3)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0), (3,2), (2,1)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1), (3,3)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3), (3,2)

I'll use a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):

Continuing from above, after constructing a BFS traversal, we find:
Path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Result:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
