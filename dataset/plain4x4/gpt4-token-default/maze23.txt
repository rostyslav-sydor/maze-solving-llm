To solve the maze, I need to interpret the adjacency list into a navigable graph and then find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Here is the adjacency list, graphically understood:
```
(2,1) <-> (1,1) 
(1,1) <-> (1,0) 
(0,2) <-> (1,2)
(1,2) <-> (1,3) 
(2,1) <-> (3,1) 
(3,0) <-> (3,1) 
(0,2) <-> (0,3)
(1,3) <-> (2,3) 
(1,2) <-> (2,2) 
(1,0) <-> (0,0) 
(2,3) <-> (3,3)
(0,2) <-> (0,1)
(3,2) <-> (3,3) 
(3,2) <-> (3,1)
(3,0) <-> (2,0) 
```
Using breadth-first search (BFS) for shortest path:

1. Start from (0,0)
2. Follows paths to (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Path found:
```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```
This path navigates through the connected nodes based on adjacency using BFS. The final output, formatted as requested:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
