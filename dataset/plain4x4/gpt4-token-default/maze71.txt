To solve the maze, we must find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided.

Starting from (0,0), we have connections to adjacent nodes (0,1) and (1,0). Upon inspection, moving from (0,0) to (0,1) and then following the connections in an effective manner finds a route to the target.

The path from (0,0) to (3,3) within the given adjacency list can be structured as:
- From (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (1,1)
- From (1,1) to (2,1)
- From (2,1) to (2,2)
- From (2,2) to (3,2)
- From (3,2) to (3,3)

Constructed path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
