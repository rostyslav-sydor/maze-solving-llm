To solve the maze and find the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), we'll start by transforming the adjacency list into a more usable form, map out the connections, and then use a simple pathfinding algorithm like breadth-first search (BFS).

The adjacency list tells us the following connections:
- (2,1) <-> (2,2)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (1,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (3,2) <-> (2,2)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (2,1) <-> (1,1)

Now, we search for a path using BFS starting at (0,0):

1. Start at (0,0). The options are to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), go to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), choices are (1,2) and (0,3).
4. Continue to (1,2), and from there to (1,3).
5. From (1,3) go to (2,3) and from (2,3) to (3,3).

Thus the path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
