To solve the given maze, we'll first convert the adjacency list into a more structured format to facilitate pathfinding:

Adjacency list:
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0)
- (1,2) is connected to (1,1)
- (2,3) is connected to (1,3)
- (3,1) is connected to (3,0)
- (2,2) is connected to (2,1)
- (3,2) is connected to (3,3) and (2,2)
- (1,1) is connected to (0,1)
- (1,2) is connected to (1,3)
- (0,2) is connected to (0,3)
- (2,0) is connected to (2,1), (1,0), and (3,0)
- (0,3) is connected to (1,3)
- (3,3) is connected to (2,3)

Origin and target coordinates:
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)

Using a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path from origin to target:
 
Path:
- Start from (0,0)
- Move to (1,0) 
- Move to (2,0)
- Move to (3,0)
- Move to (3,1)
- Move to (3,2)
- Move to (3,3), which is the target

Formatted as required:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
