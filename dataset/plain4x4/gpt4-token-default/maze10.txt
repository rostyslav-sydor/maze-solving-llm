To solve the maze, we navigate from the entry point `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>` to the exit point `<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>`, using the connections described in the adjacency list between `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`.

Here is the path traced through the adjacency relationships given in the list:

1. Start from `(0,0)` - move to `(1,0)` using `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
2. Move from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)` via `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
3. Next from `(2,0)` to `(3,0)` via `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`
4. From `(3,0)` to `(3,1)` via `(3,0) <--> (3,1)`
5. Move up from `(3,1)` to `(3,2)` via `(3,1) <--> (3,2)`
6. From `(3,2)` to `(3,3)` using `(3,3) <--> (3,2)` which reaches the target.

The complete path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
