To solve the maze, we need to build a graph from the adjacency list and perform a pathfinding algorithm, such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), starting from the origin (0,0) to reach the target (3,3).

The adjacency list provided defines the following connections between cells:
```
(1,1) <-> (2,1)
(0,1) <-> (0,2)
(2,3) <-> (1,3)
(0,3) <-> (0,2)
(1,3) <-> (1,2)
(3,3) <-> (3,2)
(2,3) <-> (2,2)
(3,1) <-> (3,0)
(3,2) <-> (2,2)
(0,0) <-> (1,0)
(2,0) <-> (2,1)
(0,3) <-> (1,3)
(1,2) <-> (1,1)
(3,1) <-> (3,2)
(1,0) <-> (2,0)
```

Starting BFS from (0,0), the path sequence would logically proceed:
1. From (0,0) to nearby nodes based on given relations: -> (1,0)
2. From (1,0) to (2,0)
3. From (2,0) to (2,1)
4. From (2,1) to (1,1)
5. From (1,1) to (1,2)
6. From (1,2) to (1,3)
7. From (1,3) to (2,3)
8. From (2,3) to (3,3) (the target)

Therefore, the path solution is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
