I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move up from (1,1) to (2,2).
3. Move right from (2,2) to (3,3).

The path avoids visiting any of the walls or obstacles in the maze. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
