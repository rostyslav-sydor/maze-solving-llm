I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then down and to the right at the second intersection (2,2), and finally up and to the right at the third intersection (3,3) to reach the target (3,3).

Note that the path is a total of 3 moves.
