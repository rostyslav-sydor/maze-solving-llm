I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then down and to the right again (2,2), and finally ends at the target (3,3).

Note that the maze has a single path from the origin to the target, and all intersections are marked with either <ORIGIN_START> or <TARGET_END> tokens.
