I understand. Here is the solution to the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move north from (0,0) to (0,1).
2. Move east from (0,1) to (1,1).
3. Move north from (1,1) to (1,2).
4. Move east from (1,2) to (2,2).
5. Move north from (2,2) to (2,3).
6. Move east from (2,3) to (3,3).

The path avoids visiting any duplicate coordinates.
