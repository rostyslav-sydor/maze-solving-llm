I understand. Here is the solution to the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The maze has a total of 9 tokens, and the shortest path has 5 edges.

Please note that the path is represented as a list of coordinate pairs, with the first coordinate being the row and the second coordinate being the column.
