I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of 8 steps, moving north, west, south, west, south, east, east, and north to reach the target.

Please note that the path is not unique, and there may be other valid solutions for the maze.
