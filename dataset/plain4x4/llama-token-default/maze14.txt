I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then down and to the right at the second intersection (2,2), and finally ends at the target (3,3).

Please note that the path is a simple one, and there may be other solutions to the maze depending on the starting point and the rules of the maze.
