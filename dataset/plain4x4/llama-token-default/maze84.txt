I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move down from (1,1) to (1,2).
3. Move right from (1,2) to (2,2).
4. Move down from (2,2) to (2,3).
5. Move right from (2,3) to (3,3).

The path is a total of 5 steps.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
