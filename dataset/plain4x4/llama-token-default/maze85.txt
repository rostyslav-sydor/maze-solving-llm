I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then up and to the right again at the second intersection (2,2), and finally down and to the right at the third intersection (3,3) to reach the target (3,3).

Please note that the path is limited to 200 words as requested.
