I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move down from (0,0) to (1,0).
2. Move right from (1,0) to (2,0).
3. Move down from (2,0) to (2,1).
4. Move right from (2,1) to (2,2).
5. Move down from (2,2) to (3,2).
6. Move right from (3,2) to (3,1).
7. Move down from (3,1) to (3,3).

The path has a total of 7 steps.
