I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move north from (0,0) to (1,0).
2. Move east from (1,0) to (1,1).
3. Move north from (1,1) to (2,1).
4. Move east from (2,1) to (2,2).
5. Move north from (2,2) to (3,2).
6. Move east from (3,2) to (3,3).

The path avoids visiting any of the walls or the origin. The total distance traveled is 6 steps.
