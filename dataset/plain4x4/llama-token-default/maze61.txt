I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then down and to the right again at the second intersection (2,2), and finally ends at the target (3,3).

Note that the maze has a single solution, and the path I provided is the shortest possible path between the origin and the target.
