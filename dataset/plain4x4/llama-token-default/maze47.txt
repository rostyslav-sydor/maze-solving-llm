I understand. Here is the solution to the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), continues right and up at the second intersection (2,2), and ends at the target (3,3).

Please note that the path is a simple one and there may be other solutions to the maze. If you would like me to find additional solutions, please let me know.
