I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,3) (1,2) (2,1) (2,3) (3,2) (3,0) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (0,3).
2. Move down from (0,3) to (1,2).
3. Move right from (1,2) to (2,1).
4. Move down from (2,1) to (2,3).
5. Move right from (2,3) to (3,2).
6. Move down from (3,2) to (3,0).

Please note that the path is represented in a coordinate list format, where the first coordinate is the row and the second coordinate is the column.
