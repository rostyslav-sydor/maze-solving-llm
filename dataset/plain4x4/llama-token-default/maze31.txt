I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move down from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move right from (1,1) to (2,2).
3. Move down from (2,2) to (3,3).

Please note that the path is represented as a list of coordinate pairs, with each pair consisting of a row and a column. The path starts at the origin and ends at the target, as specified in the problem statement.
