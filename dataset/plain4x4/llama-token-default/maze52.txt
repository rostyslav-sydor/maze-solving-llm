I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves up and to the right at the first intersection (1,1), then down and to the right again (2,2), and finally up and to the right once more (3,3) to reach the target (3,3).

Please note that the path is a simple one and there may be other solutions to the maze. If you would like me to find additional solutions, please let me know.
