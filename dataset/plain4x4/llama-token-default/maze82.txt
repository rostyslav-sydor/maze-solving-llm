I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of 9 steps, moving east, south, west, and north.

Please note that the path is not the shortest solution, but it is one possible solution for the given maze.
