I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3). The path consists of the following steps:

1. Move down from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move right from (1,1) to (2,2).
3. Move down from (2,2) to (3,3).

The path avoids visiting any of the walls or the origin/target. The total distance traveled is 3 steps.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
