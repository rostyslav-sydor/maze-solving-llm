To find a solution in the maze represented by the adjacency list, we will find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Based on the data provided, we need to determine a sequence of valid moves that lead from the origin to the target using the allowable transitions mentioned in the adjacency list.

Here are the steps and reasoning to solve the maze described:

1. **Understand the Adjacency List**: The given list shows directly connected cells (or rooms) in which movement can take place. This represents the edges in a graph where the nodes are cell coordinates.

2. **Origin and Target**: The entry point of the maze is the origin (0,0) and the exit is the target (3,3).

3. **Translating Adjacency List**: Here's the mapping of possible moves:
    - (1,3) with (0,3) and (2,3)
    - (0,3) with (0,2)
    - (3,1) with (3,0)
    - (1,0) with (0,0)
    - (1,2) with (0,2) and (1,1)
    - (1,1) with (1,0)
    - (3,3) with (2,3)
    - (3,2) with (3,3)
    - (2,2) with (2,1) and (3,2)
    - (0,1) with (0,0)
    - (3,0) with (2,0)
    - (2,0) with (2,1)
    
4. **Plan the Path**: Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the possible paths using either depth-first search or breadth-first search in a systematic way:
    - Start at (0,0)
    - Move to (0,1) (direct link from origin)
    - From (0,1) move to (0,2) (using cell (0,3) as intermediate)
    - From (0,2) move to (0,3), then to (1,3) using adjacent cells
    - Move from (1,3) to (0,3) and then to (2,3)
    - From (2,3), continue on to (3,3) using linked cells 

Going through the possible linked paths, here's a successful route from the origin to the target:

- Start from (0,0)
- Move from (0,0) to (1,0) [Since (1,0) <-> (0,0)]
- From (1,0) move to (1,1) [Since (1,1) <-> (1,0)]
- Then from (1,1) to (1,2) [Since (1,1) <-> (1,2)]
- Move on from (1,2) to (0,2) and (0,3) using the path (1,2) <-> (0,2), (0,3) <-> (0,2)
- Progress from (0,3) to (1,3) [Since (1,3) <-> (0,3)]
- From (1,3) to (2,3) [Since (1,3) <-> (2,3)]
- Finally from (2,3) reach the target (3,3) [Since (3,3) <-> (2,3)]

Thus, the path is:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path uses all valid moves given in the adjacency list to navigate from the start (origin) to the end (target) effectively.
