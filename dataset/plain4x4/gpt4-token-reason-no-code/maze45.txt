To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list and determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can use a graph traversal method such as Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step analysis and traversal reasoning to find the solution path:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the maze as a graph where each node is a point in the coordinate system (for example, (2,1)), and an edge between nodes represents a direct pathway.

   Based on the adjacency list provided:
   
   - (0,3) connects to [(1,3), (0,2)]
   - (1,3) connects to [(0,3), (2,3)]
   - (2,3) connects to [(1,3), (3,3), (2,2)]
   - (3,3) connects to [(2,3), (3,2)]
   - (0,2) connects to [(0,3), (0,1)]
   - (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)]
   - (0,0) connects to [(1,0), (0,1)]
   - (1,0) connects to [(0,0), (2,0)]
   - (2,0) connects to [(1,0), (3,0)]
   - (3,0) connects to [(2,0), (3,1)]
   - (3,1) connects to [(3,0), (3,2)]
   - (3,2) connects to [(3,1), (3,3)]
   - (2,2) connects to [(2,3)]
   - (1,1) connects to [(1,2), (2,1)]
   - (1,2) connects to [(1,1)]
   - (2,1) connects to [(1,1), (2,0)]

2. **Graph Traversal**: Start from the initial node (0,0) and explore all connected nodes layer by layer.

   Using BFS:
   - From (0,0) go to [(1,0), (0,1)]
   - From (1,0) go to [(2,0)]
   - From (2,0) go to [(3,0)]
   - From (3,0) go to [(3,1)]
   - From (3,1) go to [(3,2)]
   - From (3,2) go to [(3,3)]

3. **Path Construction**: As we find that (3,3) can be reached by connecting pathways using BFS, we can reconstruct the path from this finish point backwards using the breadcrumbs set by BFS to reach the start point.

   Constructing path:
   - Start from (3,3) back to (3,2)
   - From (3,2) to (3,1)
   - From (3,1) to (3,0)
   - From (3,0) to (2,0)
   - From (2,0) to (1,0)
   - From (1,0) back to the origin at (0,0)

**Solution Output:**
- The final, simplified solution path would be: `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This traverses each node along the shortest path as discovered by BFS, without having to backtrack any nodes, ensuring that the path from (0,0) to (3,3) is direct and correct as per the adjacency list connections given.
