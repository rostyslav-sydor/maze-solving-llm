To solve the maze problem described by the adjacency list, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). Given that BFS explores the nodes in layers, expanding outwards from the start node and storing each node’s predecessor, it ensures that the first time a node is reached, it is by the shortest path from the start node. Thus, using BFS in a graph represented maze will help find the shortest path from the entry point (origin) to the exit point (target).

**Problem Summary:**
The maze is described using an adjacency graph with the origin at (0,0) and target at (3,3). The paths are given in couples indicating bi-directional connections between points.

**Steps to Find the Solution:**
1. Represent the maze as a graph where each cell is a vertex and each bi-directional connection between cells forms an edge.
2. Parse the adjacency list to construct this graph structure. Vertices are the unique coordinates, and edges are derived from the connections indicated between these coordinates.
3. Implement BFS:
   - Initialize BFS with the origin node `(0,0)` as the starting point.
   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to keep track of each node’s predecessor to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.
   - As BFS proceeds, each node will be explored only once, ensuring that we find the shortest path from origin to target.
4. Upon reaching the target node during BFS traversal, backtrack using the predecessor relationship to construct the path from the origin to the target.
5. Format this path as required by encapsulating coordinates between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens.

**Resulting Path:**
- The computation will yield a series of moves from `(0,0)` progressing towards `(3,3)` following the shortest available path derived from the graph based on the connections provided.

**Output Format Expected:**
- The output should list each coordinate in sequence, demonstrating the steps taken from the origin to the target. The format for the output is exemplified by `<PATH_START> COORDINATES <PATH_END>`, where `COORDINATES` is a space-separated list of tuples representing the path.

With the detailed analysis of the maze setup and the methodological implementation of BFS, the accurate path can be derived and accurately formatted, embracing the structured requirements provided in the problem statement. Ensure each adjacency and coordinates are accurately mapped and checked against possible disconnections or isolated points within the maze to guarantee completeness and correctness of the solution path.
