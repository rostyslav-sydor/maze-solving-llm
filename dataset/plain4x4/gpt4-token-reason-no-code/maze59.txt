To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, you can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is commonly used for such tasks because it systematically explores the graph level by level, making it suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one in this maze. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you might go about doing this:

1. **Parsing the Adjacency List**: 
   - Extract the relationships from the adjacency list given. For instance, the edge `(2,3) <--> (3,3)` means that from coordinate `(2,3)`, you can move to `(3,3)` and vice versa.
   - Form a graph representation, where each node corresponds to a coordinate, like `(x, y)`, and each edge signifies a direct connection to another node.

2. **Define the Start (Origin) and Destination (Target) Points**: 
   - As listed, the origin/start point is `(0,0)` and the target/endpoint is `(3,3)`.

3. **Implementing BFS to Find the Shortest Path**: 
   - Begin at the origin `(0,0)`, and explore each possible move or connecting node. Keep a record of each visited node to avoid revisiting and to stop infinite loops.
   - Track the path: For each node, remember the preceding node. This way, when you reach the destination, you can reconstruct the path by backtracking from the endpoint to the start.
   
4. **Construct the Path**:
   - Once the BFS reaches the target coordinate `(3,3)`, you can reconstruct the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` by following back from the target to the origin, using your record of where each step came from.

5. **Output the Correct Format**:
   - Convert the reconstructed path into the desired output format, starting from the origin and listing each step until reaching the endpoint.

The solution path will be formulated using the BFS pathfinding result and then neatly formatted within the specified token markers. 

Given the BFS guarantees the shortest path for unweighted graphs and no disconnections in the maze's adjacency list between the origin and destination, the expected result is straightforward to output once the path is reconstructed.

**Example of Final Output** (based on assuming BFS execution and path reconstruction):
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
``` 

This reflects one possible shortest path, though there could be others depending on alternative viable paths BFS might explore during its run through the graph.
