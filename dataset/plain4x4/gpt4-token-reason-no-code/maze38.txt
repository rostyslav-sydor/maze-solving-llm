The given maze is represented as an adjacency list, showing directly connected coordinates. To solve the maze, I will trace a path from the start point `(0,0)` to the end point `(3,3)` using these connections. 

Here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Start Point**: `(0,0)`  
   From the adjacency list, we see `(0,0)` is connected to `(0,1)`.

2. **Go to `(0,1)`**:  
   From `(0,1)`, the connected coordinate is `(1,1)`. 

3. **Go to `(1,1)`**:  
   From `(1,1)`, we can move to `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`. Given traversing back to `(0,1)` is going back to the previous node, we choose `(1,0)`.

4. **Go to `(1,0)`**:  
   From `(1,0)`, the possibilities are `(1,1)` and `(2,0)`, again avoid moving back to `(1,1)`, so you progress to `(2,0)`.

5. **Go to `(2,0)**:  
   From `(2,0)`, it connects to `(2,1)`, `(3,0)`, `(1,0)`. Choose `(2,1)` to keep moving in an orderly sequence.

6. **Go to `(2,1)`**:   
   `(2,1)` connects directly to `(2,2)`.

7. **Go to `(2,2)`**:  
   From `(2,2)`, move to `(1,2)`. Remembering that `(2,2)` also connects back to `(2,1)`, which is a previously traveled node.

8. **Go to `(1,2)`**:   
   From `(1,2)`, the next connection would be `(0,2)`. It forms a direct link, continuing the stepping up in grids without backtracking.

9. **Go to `(0,2)`**:  
   Proceed from `(0,2)` to `(1,3)` as it's directly connected.

10. **Go to `(1,3)`**:  
   Then, move from `(1,3)` to contiguous `(2,3)`.

11. **Go to `(2,3)`**:  
   From `(2,3)`, progress to `(3,3)` following the available connection.

12. **End Point `(3,3)`** is achieved. This forms the final point and the destination as desired.

Adding each step together, the path discovered is:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This solution effectively follows a path through the maze by only traveling through each connected point once and mathematically finding the shortest path using adjacency connections provided.
