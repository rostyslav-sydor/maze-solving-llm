To solve the maze, we can employ a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, we opt for BFS since it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one. I'll explain the BFS approach:

1. **Initialization**: Convert the adjacency list into a more usable data structure such as a dictionary to keep track of adjacent nodes. From the provided adjacency list, create a dictionary where each key (node) holds a list of connected nodes (neighbors).

2. **BFS Algorithm Setup**: Initialize a queue with the starting point, which is also marked in a `visited` set to avoid revisiting. Additionally, maintain a `prev` dictionary to reconstruct the path once the target is located.
  
3. **Execution**:
   - Dequeue a node from the queue.
   - Check if itâ€™s the target node. If so, break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, enqueue all adjacent nodes that have not been visited, marking them as visited and noting their predecessor.
   
4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target is found, backtrack using the `prev` dictionary from the target node to the start node to extract the path.

5. **Output the Path**: Format the path according to the specified output tokens and order.

Following this approach using the given adjacency list, BFS would explore from the start `(0,0)` through the graph, eventually reaching the end `(3,3)`. Here is the solution:

**BFS Pathfinder Execution**

Start at node `(0,0)`. Based on adjacency, possible moves:
- Visit `(0,1)` from `(0,0)`.

Proceed to `(0,1)`, adjacent nodes:
- Already visited `(0,0)`.
- Visit `(1,1)` from `(0,1)`.

Continue from `(1,1)`, adjacent nodes:
- Already visited `(0,1)`.
- Visit `(2,1)` from `(1,1)`.
- Visit `(1,0)` from `(1,1)`.

From `(2,1)`, visit:
- Return to `(1,1)` which is already visited.
- Visit `(3,1)` from `(2,1)`.
  
From `(3,1)`, visit:
- Already visited `(2,1)`.
- Visit `(3,2)` from `(3,1)`.

From `(3,2)`, visit:
- Return to `(3,1)` which is already visited.
- Visit `(3,3)` from `(3,2)`.
  
Reached `(3,3)`, which is the target node. Trace back from `(3,3)` to `(0,0)` using the `prev` dictionary.

**Path Reconstruction**
- `(3,3)` to `(3,2)` to `(3,1)` to `(2,1)` to `(1,1)` to `(0,1)` to `(0,0)`.

**Formatted Solution Output**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path navigates the maze from the start `(0,0)` to the finish `(3,3)` efficiently, making optimal decisions at each step to explore all possible routes but only expanding the shortest known one at each BFS iteration.
