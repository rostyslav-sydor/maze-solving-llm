To find the path through the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), I will apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This graph traversal approach works well for unweighted graphs like this one where each edge has the same "cost" or distance between nodes. BFS explores the graph layer by layer, expanding out from the origin, until reaching the target, ensuring the shortest path is found due to its nature.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning how BFS would be used to solve this:

1. **Start from the Origin**: Begin at coordinate (0,0).
2. **Explore Neighbors**: From (0,0), the adjacency list indicates connections to (1,0). Add (1,0) to a queue for exploration.
3. **Continue BFS Exploration**: 
   - One level deeper from (1,0), find its neighbors from the adjacency list. It's connected to (0,0) which is already considered, and (2,0).
   - Add (2,0) to the exploration queue.
4. **Proceed with Next Level from BFS Queue**: From (2,0), follow connections as outlined in the adjacency list to (3,0) and (1,0) is already visited.
   - Moving to (3,0), add it to the queue.
5. **Continue Traversing**: Explore from (3,0), leading next to (3,1) and then from (3,1) to (3,2).
   - Next, from (3,2) move to (3,3) which is the target.
6. **Found Target**: When (3,3) is reached, backtrace the path using a structure that tracked where each node was reached from, to reconstruct the path from (0,0) to (3,3).

The backtracing would reconstruct this sequence of moves:

- Start at (0,0), moved to (1,0).
- Then moved to (2,0).
- Progressed from (2,0) to (3,0).
- Followed from (3,0) to (3,1).
- Then from (3,1) to (3,2).
- Finally, from (3,2) to (3,3).

Thus, the overall solution path from the origin to the target is `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`.

This BFS approach guarantees that the shortest path will be found in an unweighted graph and efficiently handles traversal with the systematic exploration of each layer before moving deeper into the maze.
