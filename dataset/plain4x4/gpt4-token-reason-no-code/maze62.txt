To solve this maze problem, we'll first build a graph from the adjacency list provided and then use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin to the target. The adjacency list describes a grid-based graph where each node represents a coordinate point in the maze, and edges show direct connections between points.

Here's how the solution is approached:

1. **Graph Construction**: Extract adjacency pairs from the adjacency list to form a graph. Each pair represents a two-way connection, so it should be added to the graph symmetrically to represent the bidirectional path.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Implement BFS to find the shortest path from the start (origin) point (0,0) to the end (target) point (3,3). 
   - Initiate the BFS from the origin, storing each node and its parent in a dictionary which helps to keep track of the visited nodes and tracing the path back from the target to the origin.
   - As BFS progresses level by level, each node's neighbors are checked. If the target node is reached, BFS can be stopped, ensuring that the shortest path is found due to the nature of level-based progression.

3. **Path Tracing**: After reaching the target in BFS, trace back from the target node to the origin using the parent dictionary populated during BFS. This creates the sequence of moves from start to finish.

4. **Format the output**: Encapsulate the path sequence within the specified tokens `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.

For visualization, let's consider how the BFS would progress:
- Start at (0,0), and enqueue its neighbors.
- Explore neighbors (e.g., (0,1), (1,0)), mark them as visited, and keep checking subsequent levels, enqueuing unvisited neighbors until (3,3) is reached.
- Once (3,3) is reached, backtrack using the parent dictionary to determine the path taken and output that path.

By implementing these steps and following BFS, it's expected to yield a sequence of coordinates from (0,0) to (3,3) that navigates through the maze, avoiding any loops or revisits, owing to the properties of BFS in handling unweighted graphs for shortest path problems.

Output:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This example assumes BFS found a valid and possibly shortest path through the maze by consistently moving to unvisited neighbors and directly tracing the path to the target.
