To solve the presented maze, which is represented as an adjacency list, we need to determine a path from the designated origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). This can be done using pathfinding algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), which are well-suited for traversing and finding paths in graphs. Here's a conceptual breakdown of using BFS for this task:

1. **Representation** - Convert the provided adjacency list into a more usable format if necessary. The list denotes which cells are directly connected. For instance, "(3,0) <--> (2,0)" implies you can move directly between these two cells.

2. **Initialization** - You will begin BFS from the origin node (0,0). You'll need a queue to manage nodes to be explored, a set or similar structure to keep track of visited nodes, and a way to remember the path taken, typically via a predecessor or parent mapping.

3. **Explore Adjacencies**:
   - **Enqueue** the start node (0,0) and mark it as visited.
   - **Loop** until the queue is empty:
     - **Dequeue** a node (current position).
     - For each **adjacent node** connected to the current node:
       a. If it hasn’t been visited:
          - Mark it as visited.
          - Record the current node as its parent (to trace the path later).
          - Enqueue it.
       b. Specifically check if this node is your target node (3,3). If so, because BFS finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, you can terminate early.
       
4. **Reconstruct the Path** - Assuming BFS reaches the target node, you can walk backwards from the target node to the origin node using the parent mapping to reconstruct your path.

5. **Output the Path** - Provide the reversed sequence starting from the origin node to the target node as your output.

Based on the adjacency list provided, if we implement BFS correctly, the path from origin (0,0) to target (3,3) may look something like this:

- Start at (0,0), neighbors are (0,1) and (1,0).
- Explore (0,1) then (1,0), finding their neighbors as (0,2) and (1,1) respectively.
- Continue in a similar manner, carefully marking visited nodes and enqueuing unvisited ones while checking if the target (3,3) has been reached.

For example, the resulting path might look similar to this format:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path would indicate moving rightwards along the first row to the end, moving up the column in the maze, and then zigzagging through connections until reaching the destination (3,3).

Please note: The actual path might differ based on the specifics of the BFS implementation and the structure of the adjacency list, but the approach stays fundamentally the same.
