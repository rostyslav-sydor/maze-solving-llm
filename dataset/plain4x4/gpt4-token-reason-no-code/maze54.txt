To solve the maze, we need to:

1. Interpret the adjacency list and construct an undirected graph where each pair of coordinates represents a two-way movement between nodes (locations on the maze).
2. Determine the shortest path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using a pathfinding algorithm (BFS or DFS are common choices).
3. Format the resulting path as a sequence of coordinates enclosed within <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>.

Based on the adjacency list provided:

The set of edges defining movements in the maze includes:
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (2,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,1)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)

Given the origin as (0,0) and the target as (3,3) and tracing a possible path through the available moves:

1. From (0,0), you can move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), you can move to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), you can move up to (1,1).
5. From (1,1), you move to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), proceed to (1,3).
7. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
8. From (2,3), move to (2,2).
9. From (2,2), proceed to (3,2).
10. From (3,2), you can finally move to (3,3), which is the goal.

The sequence of moves completes the solution to the maze. The corresponding output should thus be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This output represents a sequence of accessible locations starting at (0,0) and terminating at (3,3) via viable paths inferred from the adjacency list provided.
