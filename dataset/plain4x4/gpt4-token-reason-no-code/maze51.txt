To solve the maze presented as a graph, we start by parsing the adjacency list and understanding the connections, then apply a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is particularly effective in finding the shortest path between two nodes in such scenarios. Here's the step-by-step reasoning without the actual code:

1. **Parse the Adjacency List**: Translate the given text of adjacency relationships into a structured form suitable for traversal. Example: `(3,3) <--> (2,3)` means (3,3) is connected to (2,3) and vice versa.

2. **Define Start and End Points**: Identify the start `(0,0)` and end `(3,3)` points from the given maze description to know our entry and exit.

3. **Graph Algorithm Implementation** (BFS used in this example):
    - Initialize a queue starting with the entry node (origin) and mark this node as visited.
    - From the current node, explore all adjacent (connected) nodes. For each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the path (parent node), and enqueue it.
    - Continue the exploration until you find the target node or all possible paths have been examined.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node has been reached, backtrack from the exit node to the entry node using the recorded parents to rebuild the path taken.

5. **Output the Path**: With the path determined from the BFS traversal and reconstruction, format the path within the required `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens including each visited node coordinate in order from entry to exit.

Following this pseudocode reasoning, letâ€™s output the resulting path found:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Explanation for the chosen path: Starting from (0,0), the path moves vertically down to (1,0), continues in this series till (3,0), simulating moving rightward, and then moves upwards till the bottom right corner (3,3). Each step is connected according to the adjacency list given, confirming a valid path through the maze.
