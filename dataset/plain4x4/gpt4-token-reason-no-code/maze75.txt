To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list and determine a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be effectively used. BFS is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as this, where each edge holds equal weight or cost.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The graph (from the adjacency list): Convert the adjacency list into a usable form. This involves parsing out each relations like "(1,3) <--> (0,3)" and structuring these into a graph where each node points to its accessible neighbors.

2. **Graph Structure**:
   - From the adjacency format, the nodes and their direct connections can be recognized and structured. For example, node `(1,3)` is connected to `(0,3)`, `(1,2)`, and `(2,3)`.

3. **BFS Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Start at the origin `(0,0)`.
   - Use a queue to manage nodes to be explored, starting with `(0,0)`.
   - Maintain a set to record visited nodes to avoid cycles and re-exploration.
   - As you dequeue a node, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited.
   - Track the path: For each node processed, keep a record of where it was reached from (its parent). This can be done using a dictionary mapping each node to the node from which it was accessed.

4. **Extracting the Path**:
   - Once BFS locates the target node `(3,3)`, backtrack from the target node to the origin using the dictionary that records node origins, constructing the path by following parent links in reverse.

5. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Start from `(3,3)` and use the parent links to trace back to `(0,0)`, noting each coordinate.
   - Reverse the obtained path since it will be constructed from target to source.

6. **Output**:
   - Format the path coordinates appropriately between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens, ensuring the coordinates are ordered from the entry to the exit.

### Example Output Construction:

Given the adjacency list and BFS formulation, the nodes get processed, and the first path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` found can be recorded. We build the solution path in reverse using the parent links and then reverse this to display from origin to destination.

Thus correct output, following the BFS traversal path might look something like:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path is based on BFS discovering the shortest path through the unweighted edges of the graph represented by the adjacency list. Each pair of coordinates represent a step in movement from one node to its adjacent node till the exit point is reached.
