To find the solution of the maze provided in adjacency list format, we can use an algorithm suited for searching or traversing through graphs, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Since the requirement is simply to find a path between two points, BFS would be preferred as it will find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

The adjacency list describes which vertices (cells in this maze) are directly connected (adjacent) to each other. The strategy will be to traverse the graph starting from the origin `(0,0)` and searching until the target `(3,3)` is reached.

Based on the adjacency list provided:
- (3,3) connects to (2,3).
- (0,3) connects to (1,3).
- (0,1) connects to (0,0).
- And so on...

We would proceed as follows, starting from the origin `(0,0)`:
1. Check all possible moves from `(0,0)`, which according to the list is to move to `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, we can move to `(1,1)` or back to `(0,0)`.
3. From `(1,1)`, we can move to `(1,2)`.
4. From `(1,2)`, moves are possible to `(2,2)` or back to `(1,1)`.
5. From `(2,2)`, move to `(1,2)` or move forward to `(3,2)`.
6. From `(3,2)`, we can move to `(3,1)` or the target `(3,3)`.

This gives us the path, constructing it as we confirm each step through reachable nodes while avoiding cycles and backtracking to previous nodes unless necessary:
- Start at `(0,0)` -> Move to `(0,1)` -> Move to `(1,1)` -> Move to `(1,2)` -> Move to `(2,2)` -> Move to `(3,2)` -> Reach target `(3,3)`.

The path in the format requested would then be:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path is derived through logical deduction of each step taken from origin to destination, tracing which nodes can access each other directly per the adjacency definitions.
