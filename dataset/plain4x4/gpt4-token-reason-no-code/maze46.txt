To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, we need to perform a path finding algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) from the starting point (origin) to the ending point (target).

Here’s a step-by-step reasoning of how we could approach this using BFS, given the adjacency list method provides a good structural means to efficiently traverse each vertex:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Parse the adjacency list and create a graph representation. In this case, you can visualize each coordinate as a node in the graph.
   - The graph's nodes will be the coordinates, and the edges will connect nodes if there is a segue between them as per "adjacency list".
   - Define and initialize a queue to explore nodes, a set to record visited nodes, and a dictionary to store the path (from where each node can be accessed). This dict will help in reconstructing the path later.

2. **Load Start and End Points**:
   - The origin point from where to start the maze traversal is (0,0).
   - The target point, or the maze's exit, is (3,3).

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Enqueue the origin and mark it as visited.
   - While there are still nodes to visit in the queue:
     - Dequeue the current node.
     - If it’s the target node, you're done with traversal and can construct the path.
     - Otherwise, for each adjacent node that hasn’t been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent (for path reconstruction), and enqueue it.

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Starting from the target node, track back using the parent record until you reach the origin. As you go back, you collect the coordinates from the end to the start.
   - Reverse the collected list of coordinates to get the path from origin to target.

5. **Output The Path**:
   - Format the path as specified with starting <PATH_START> and ending <PATH_END> and output the list of coordinates that represent the successful path through the maze from the origin to the target position.

Given the adjacency list described and the BFS approach:
- You would first comprehend all direct connections between nodes.
- Implement BFS, starting from (0,0) and seeking (3,3) with the aforementioned methods of marking and queuing nodes.
- A successful BFS traverses in layers from the starting point and is very efficient in finding the shortest path in an unweighted setting like this, where each connection has effectively 'equal weight' or cost.

The precise sequence of coordinates in the path output would be functionally dependent on the accurate parsing of the adjacency list and a correctly conducted BFS process. 

Example Output:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
Note: Path may vary based on correct adjacency interpretation and traversal choices. The BFS would guarantee the shortest path given this maze setup.
