To solve the maze problem stated, let's first understand the structure of the adjacency list and then map out a path from the origin to the target. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) technique for this task, as BFS is particularly well-suited for shortest path problems on unweighted graphs like this one.

1. **Adjacency List**: We have the vertices in the form of grid coordinates and edges representing passageways between cells:
   - (3,1) <-> (3,0)
   - (0,2) <-> (0,3)
   - (3,3) <-> (3,2)
   - (1,2) <-> (2,2)
   - (2,1) <-> (3,1)
   - (0,0) <-> (0,1)
   - (1,2) <-> (0,2)
   - (0,0) <-> (1,0)
   - (1,0) <-> (1,1)
   - (2,3) <-> (3,3)
   - (2,1) <-> (2,0)
   - (0,3) <-> (1,3)
   - (3,1) <-> (3,2)
   - (1,1) <-> (1,2)
   - (1,3) <-> (2,3)

2. **Origin and Target**:
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

**Constructing the Solution Based on BFS**:
- **Initialization**: Start from the origin (0,0) and explore neighbors according to the adjacency list. Use a queue to manage the exploration and a set to keep track of visited nodes.

- **Exploration Process**:
  - From (0,0), the adjacency list allows movement to (0,1) and (1,0). Add these to the queue.
  - Next, from (0,1), further movement is not specified. So, back to the remaining nodes in queue.
  - From (1,0), move to (1,1), then to (1,2).
  - From (1,2), the options are (0,2) and (2,2). Keep exploring:
    - (0,2) leads to (0,3).
    - (0,3) leads to (1,3) which then connects to (2,3).
    - (2,3) leads directly to the target (3,3).
  - Alternatively, from (1,2) moving to (2,2) can also eventually connect through other paths such as through (3,2) to (3,3).

**Path Construction**:
Following the path identified through BFS:
- Start at (0,0), move to (0,1), then to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach (3,3).

**Final Path Output**:
- `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This BFS-based analysis helps determine the shortest path in an unweighted graph as it explores all immediate neighbors first before moving onto more distant ones, ensuring that by the time it reaches the target, no shorter path exists.
