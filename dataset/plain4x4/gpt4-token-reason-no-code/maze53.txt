### Maze Representation and Solving Strategy

We are provided with a maze represented as an adjacency list detailing which cells are directly reachable from others. The objective is to find a path from the starting point `(0,0)` to the destination `(3,3)`.

### Steps for Solving the Maze:

1. **Graph Construction**: Construct a graph where each node represents a cell in the maze, and each edge represents a direct path between two adjacent cells. We map the adjacency list into a graph data structure, which could typically be an adjacency matrix or adjacency list for easier traversal and reference.

2. **Start and Target Assignment**: Recognize the starting point `(0,0)` and the target point `(3,3)` from the given tokens.

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implement a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) on the maze's graph structure. Among these, BFS is advantageous for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

4. **Tracking the Path**: As the algorithm runs, keep track of the path using a predecessor or parent mapping, which helps to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

5. **Path Construction**: Once the algorithm finds the target node, backtrack using the parent mapping to construct the route from the target to the start. This path is then reversed since we need the sequence starting from the origin.

### Representation and Reasoning:
- Using Breadth-First Search, the algorithm explores all possible moves from the start position `(0,0)` and ensures that once it encounters `(3,3)`, the shortest path is identified. 

- Given the adjacency list of direct connections between cells, BFS will navigate the maze layer-by-layer (or level-by-level relative to starting point), guaranteeing that the shortest path is found due to uniform move cost (each move from one cell to an adjacent cell is considered one step).

### Example of the Output (Not Calculated, Hypothetical for Representation):

If a path is found, it might look like this:

                <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence starts at `(0,0)` and follows possible paths detailed in the adjacency list, ensuring each move is allowed, ultimately leading to `(3,3)`.

### Conclusion:

This systematic approach allows the translation of a given adjacency list into a practical pathfinding exercise using common algorithms suitable for such structures, ensuring the path meets the requirements of origin and destination as posed in the problem.
