To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, consider each pair of coordinates as nodes in the graph with edges connecting them directly. Our task is to find a path from the start (origin) coordinate (0,0) to the finish (target) coordinate (3,3).

Given that the adjacency list explicitly defines all valid movements between points, here is how one could approach solving this maze (manually, in this case, without code):

1. First, map out the connections in a clearer format for easy traversal:
   ```
   (0,0) -> (1,0)
   (0,1) -> (0,0), (1,1), (0,2)
   (0,2) -> (0,1), (0,3), (1,2)
   (0,3) -> (0,2), (1,3)
   (1,0) -> (0,0), (2,0)
   (1,1) -> (0,1)
   (1,2) -> (0,2), (1,3), (2,2)
   (1,3) -> (0,3), (1,2)
   (2,0) -> (1,0), (2,1), (3,0)
   (2,1) -> (2,0)
   (2,2) -> (1,2), (2,3)
   (2,3) -> (3,3), (2,2)
   (3,0) -> (2,0), (3,1)
   (3,1) -> (3,0), (3,2)
   (3,2) -> (3,1), (3,3)
   (3,3) -> (3,2), (2,3)
   ```

2. Starting at (0,0), use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore nodes level by level until (3,3) is reached.
   
3. A BFS implementation would use a queue and might visit the following nodes in order:
   - Start at origin (0,0) and enqueue connected node (1,0).
   - Visit (1,0) from queue and enqueue next nodes (2,0).
   - Visit (2,0) and enqueue (3,0), (2,1).
   - Visit nodes (3,0), (2,1), then (3,1), then (3,2), finally reaching (3,3).

4. Using the tracebacks from BFS, construct the path from (0,0) to (3,3):
   ```
   (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
   ```

5. Output this solution path with the required format:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

This path represents a sequential move through the graph, maintaining a valid adjacency per the provided list and respecting the traversal rules generally used in mazes or puzzles represented by graph structures.
