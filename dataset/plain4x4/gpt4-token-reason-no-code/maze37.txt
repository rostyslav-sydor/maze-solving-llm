To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list and identify the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), the key steps include:

1. **Modeling the Maze**: Build a graph from the adjacency list where nodes represent coordinates in the maze, and edges represent possible paths between these coordinates.

2. **Setting the Start and End Points**: From the given tokens, determine that the start node or origin is (0,0) and the end node or target is (3,3).

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use a standard pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path or any path from the origin to the target. Here, BFS is suitable since it is good at finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this:
   - BFS involves starting from the origin node and exploring all its neighboring nodes layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path to any node is identified by the first visit.
   - Keep a record of each node visited and the node it was visited from (parent node). This helps in reconstructing the path once the target is reached.
   
4. **Reconstructing the Path**: Once reaching the target node during the BFS search, trace back using the parent nodes to reconstruct the path from the origin to the target.

By applying these steps to your maze adjacency list, let's derive the solution path:

- **Considering BFS and Maze Layout**:
  - From (0,0), the adjacent possible move is to (1,0).
  - From (1,0), proceed to (1,1), then to (1,2).
  - From (1,2), move to (2,2).
  - From (2,2) onward proceed to (3,2) and finally to (3,3), which is the target.

  As per the adjacency list, these transitions are all plausible and lead from the beginning to the end. Therefore, this direct linkage provides a solution to navigate the maze.

- **Outputting the solution**: Captured within the provided format, the solution to the maze based on the calculations would be represented as follows:

  `<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This list provides a clear path from the start to the end. Each coordinate is directly connected to the next, adhering to the adjacency list provided.
