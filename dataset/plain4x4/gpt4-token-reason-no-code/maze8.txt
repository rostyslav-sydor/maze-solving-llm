To solve the maze represented in the adjacency list, I'll analyze the provided information to construct steps leading from the specified origin to the target. I'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach conceptually, although I won't show the code as per your request.

Here's the detailed reasoning using the clues from your adjacency list:

1. **Adjacency List Interpretation**: The edges in the adjacency list dictate which nodes are directly connected. For example, `(3,0) <--> (3,1)` indicates that moving between these coordinates is possible directly.

2. **Setting Origin and Target**: The origin node is `(0,0)` and the target node is `(3,3)`. Our objective is to find a path from the origin to the target using the connections specified.

3. **Translating into Path Search**:
   - Initialize at `(0,0)`.
   - From each node, check for all possible moves to adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, based on the adjacency list.
   - Use BFS to progressively explore broader levels of nodes, starting from the origin, until the target node is reached. BFS is suitable here because it will find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze.

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Starting at `(0,0)`, check allowable moves.
   - Proceed to `(1,0)` because it’s connected to `(0,0)`.
   - Continue from `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`, which in turn is connected to `(2,1)`.
   - Move successively through connected nodes `(2,2)`, `(2,3)` and from there to `(1,3)` based on the adjacency connections provided.
   - From `(1,3)`, move to the final target `(3,3)` via `(3,2)` then `(3,1)` and lastly to `(3,3)`.

Therefore, based on BFS progression through adjacent available paths, the path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` in order of movement, considering non-visited connections and direct pathing in each step would typically be:

- Start at `(0,0)`
- Go to `(1,0)` 
- Continue to `(2,0)`
- Then move to `(3,0)`, indicating lateral movement along row 3
- From `(3,0)`, go directly across `(3,1)`, to `(3,2)`, and finally to `(3,3)`, following direct connections present in adjacency.

This solution results in the following format:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Each move is guaranteed due to direct connections specified in the adjacency list, ensuring there are no skips or jumps outside allowed paths.
