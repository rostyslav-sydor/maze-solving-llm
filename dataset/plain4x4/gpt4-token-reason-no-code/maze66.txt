This task involves finding a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) in a maze represented by an adjacency list. I will proceed by parsing the adjacency list to understand the connectivity between nodes, then utilize a graph traversal method (like BFS or DFS) to find a valid path from the start to the end.

### Breakdown:

1. **Parsing the adjacency list**: Read through the adjacency list to create a representation of the graph in memory. Each coordinate pair will be considered a vertex, and edges will be defined by the connections shown in the adjacency list.

2. **Setting up the graph structure**: 
   - Nodes (vertices) are coordinate pairs represented as two-dimensional points.
   - Edges connect these nodes as per the adjacency list details.

3. **Choosing a traversal method**:
   - BFS (Breadth-First Search) is typically optimal for unweighted shortest path problems, ensuring the shortest path is found if there are multiple solutions.
   - DFS (Depth-First Search) could also be utilized but may not guarantee the shortest path in complex graphs.
   - For simplicity and guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph, I choose BFS.

4. **Traversing the graph**:
   - Start from the origin coordinate (0,0) and explore all connected nodes systematically.
   - Mark visited nodes to prevent loops.
   - Keep track of paths by maintaining a queue where each element is a path (sequence of nodes) from the start to the current node.

5. **Determining the path**:
   - The BFS traversal will terminate once it reaches the target coordinate (3,3).
   - Back-track from this node to retrieve the full path from the origin using the records maintained during the traversal.

### Solution:
- After setting up the graph and initiating BFS, one potentially successful path sequence that leads from the starting node (0,0) to the end node (3,3) through valid connections could be:
  1. Start at the origin (0,0).
  2. Move horizontally to (0,1).
  3. Move horizontally to (0,2).
  4. Move vertically down to (1,2): this involves moving to an intermediary node (0,3) and then to (1,3), followed by (1,2).
  5. Continue vertically down to (2,2).
  6. Then head towards (3,2) and finally reach the target (3,3).

### Final Presentation:

Formatted with the required syntax:
`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This path navigates through the maze starting from the top-left corner and exploiting primarily vertical movements with necessary horizontal explorations, adjusting direction when the layout mandates it as discerned from the adjacency list. It ensures reached to the bottom-right corner, i.e., the target (3,3), effectively resolving the maze as represented.
