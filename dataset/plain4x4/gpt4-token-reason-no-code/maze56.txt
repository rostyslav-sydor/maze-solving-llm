The maze represented by the provided adjacency list is essentially an undirected graph, where edges connect pairs of nodes (coordinates). The goal is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the connections described.

To solve the maze:
1. Start at the origin node (0,0).
2. Use a suitable graph traversal method such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) which are appropriate to explore the nodes and find a path to the target (3,3). BFS is generally preferred for shortest path finding on an unweighted graph.
3. Track the nodes visited and maintain a record of the path taken using a queue (for BFS) or stack (for DFS), along with marking visited nodes.
4. Explore each adjacent node (coordinate) based on the given adjacency connections. For each node, add it into the queue or stack if it has not been visited.
5. Continue the traversal until the target node (3,3) is reached.

Based on the provided adjacency list, let's visually trace a potential path manually:
- Starting at (0,0), we can move to (0,1), as per a direct connection.
- From (0,1), go to (0,2).
- From (0,2), go to (0,3).
- From (0,3), move to (1,3) vertically.
- From (1,3), go to (2,3).
- From (2,3), go to (3,3) which is our target.

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) could be:
<PATH_START>
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)
<PATH_END>

Depending on the graph traversal algorithm, other paths might also exist, but the path provided here navigates vertically down and horizontally right in a simple manner to reach the target from the origin. This solution strategy does not require backtracking, indicating a straightforward path exists in the given adjacency setup.
