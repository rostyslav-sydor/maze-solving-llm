To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list, which represents connections between points. The adjacency list defines which points (cells in the maze) are directly connected to each other. We can approach this by using a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the maze.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how one would proceed (without implementing the actual algorithm):

1. **Initialize**: Create a representation of the maze as a graph from the given adjacency list.

2. **Setup BFS**:
   - Use the starting point (0,0) as the root of our search.
   - Initialize a queue starting with this root.
   - Maintain a set or dictionary of visited nodes to avoid revisiting nodes and to keep track of the path followed to reach each node.

3. **Execution of BFS**:
   - Dequeue the current node (starting with (0,0)).
   - For each connected node to the current node (as listed in the adjacency list), check if the node has been visited.
   - If not, mark it as visited, record how it was reached (you might record the previous node that leads to this node), and enqueue it.
   - Continue the BFS until the queue is empty or until the target (3,3) is reached.

4. **Reconstruct Path**:
   - Once the target is reached, backtrack from the target node to the origin node using the recorded paths to list out the entire path in order.
   - This can be done by retracing from the target node to its predecessor node continuously until the origin node is reached.

5. **Output the solution**: Present the completed path as a list of coordinates from the origin to the target.

Steps based on the adjacency list are:

- Starting at (0,0), through available paths check reachable nodes: (0,1) and (1,0).
- From both (0,1) and (1,0), further explore to find more connected nodes until you finally trace paths that can lead progressively towards (3,3).

By traversing the maze using BFS:
- You discover the shortest path without risks of cycles as BFS explores at the broadest level (one complete level before moving deeper).

So the output sequence, while not computationally derived here, would be formed by logically following the above method and would be formatted as:

```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Note: The specific path sequence can vary depending on the order of navigation considered in the adjacency list, but the BFS approach ensures the shortest path discovery based on its level-wise exploration.
