In order to find the solution for the maze through the adjacency list you provided, we must first interpret the graphical representation of the maze given by the relationships (edges) between the coordinate pairs (nodes). Then, we implement a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute the path from the start point (origin) to the end point (target).

### Steps:

1. **Graph Representation:** Interpret the adjacency list to construct a graph representation:
   - Each pair of nodes (coordinates) connected with `<-->` represents a bi-directional edge.
   - From the list, build the graph such that each node is connected to its neighbors as specified.

2. **Choose a Graph Traversal Algorithm:** Opt for BFS, since it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph:
   - Start from the origin node `(0,0)`.
   - Explore all neighboring nodes, using a queue to handle the order of exploration (FIFO).
   - Mark each visited node to avoid processing a node more than once.
   - Keep track of each nodeâ€™s parent to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

3. **Reconstruct the Path:** When the target node `(3,3)` is reached during BFS traversal:
   - Backtrack from the target node to the origin node, using the stored parent pointers.
   - This produces a sequence of nodes representing the path from start to the end.

### Execution:
1. **Graph Initialization:** Define each coordinate on the graph and its associated edges based on the given adjacency list. 
2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Start at the origin `(0,0)`, pushing it to the queue with the initial path and marking it as visited.
   - Iteratively process each node from the queue, checking all its neighbors. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, enqueue it containing the running path.
   - Continue until the queue is exhausted or the target `(3,3)` is reached.
3. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Once `(3,3)` is found, backtrack using the stored parents' data to reconstruct the path.

### Output:
We would create a transcript of the BFS process, identifying when each node is discovered and its path thus far. On reaching the target, the reconstructed path marks the resolved route through the maze.

### Hypothetical Output Path:
Without executing the code, a plausible output based on BFS discovery principle might look like this:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
Note: The actual path could differ depending on the specific entry orders in the queue and the graph's exact structure which hasn't been fully visualized here. Also, ensure your BFS algorithm correctly implements the tracking and queuing for BFS in a complete program to verify and accurately derive the path.
