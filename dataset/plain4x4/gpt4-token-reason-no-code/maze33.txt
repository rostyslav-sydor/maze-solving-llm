To solve the maze puzzle provided using the adjacency list representation, we'll employ a graph traversal algorithm, often a mix of Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms typically used for such tasks. The choice between these algorithms usually depends on whether we need the shortest path (BFS) or just any path (DFS).

The adjacency list already indicates which points (nodes/vertices) in the maze can be directly reached from each other (edges). The steps followed in the mental solution include:

1. **Convert the Adjacency List to a Usable Form:** Convert the vertex pairs into a graph data structure that can be easily traversed. For example, create a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices.

2. **Set the Starting Point:** From the maze description, the starting point is (0,0). 

3. **Set the Ending Point:** The ending point as given is (3,3).

4. **Graph Traversal Algorithm Initiation:**
   - Initiate the BFS or DFS from the starting point.
   - Track visited nodes to avoid loops.
   - Save the path by noting from which node we've come to the current node (predecessors).

5. **Traversal and Path Recovery:**
   - Traverse until the endpoint (3,3) is found or all possible paths are exhausted.
   - If the endpoint is reached, backtrack using the predecessors' record to recover the path.

6. **Path Output:** 
   - Output the path from the start node to the end node.

Given the adjacency relationships provided and choosing BFS for its ability to find the shortest path:

- Begin at (0,0), exploring its neighbors and proceeding level by level.
- Track each nodeâ€™s predecessors and mark nodes as visited.
- Upon reaching (3,3), use the predecessors to backtrack from (3,3) to (0,0) to retrieve the path.

Applying these conceptual steps to the given maze adjacency list, the BFS would explore like below:

- Start from (0,0), visit `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, visit `(0,2)` and move to `(1,1)`.
- From `(1,1)`, visit `(1,0)` already seen, move to `(1,2)` via `(1,3)` as possible.
- Explore next levels typically branching out in a BFS manner until reaching `(3,3)`.

After the full exploration and backtracking through the predecessors recorded, the resulting path (done mentally here or using appropriate coding in practice) might look as follows:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path goes in a kind of straight line navigating through the zeroth column, then moves across, and finally straight down to the bottom. Note that other paths could exist depending on traversal choices made at each step, but this represents a plausible solution using BFS principles.
