In order to solve the maze described as an adjacency list and find a path from the specified origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) would be an ideal approach. Here's a step-by-step reasoning to find the path:

1. **Graph Representation**: Begin by considering the maze as a graph where each node (cell in the maze) has edges connecting it to adjacent nodes based on the adjacency list.

2. **Nodes and Edges Setup**: From the adjacency list provided, construct a map to represent the connections between nodes. Each pair mentions which nodes (cells) are directly connected:
   - (1,2) <--> (1,3)
   - (0,2) <--> (1,2)
   - (0,3) <--> (1,3)
   - and others as seen in the list.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Implement BFS, which is level-order traversal and proves efficient in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this:

   - **Starting Point**: From the origin `(0,0)`.
   - **Queue Initialization**: Use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, beginning with `(0,0)` and a parent map to reconstruct path later.
   - **Exploration**: For each node dequeued, explore its neighbors:
     - Enqueue each unvisited neighbor.
     - Update the parent of each neighbor to the current node.
   - **Finish**: When you reach `(3,3)`, the target, terminate the search.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the target `(3,3)`, traverse back using the parent map until you reach the origin `(0,0)`. This gives you the path from the target to the origin, so reverse it to get the path from origin to target.

5. **Path Output**: Return and display the path as the series of coordinates from origin to target.

Following such a procedure would yield the path for the maze. Using above method, the exploration might proceed like this:

- Start at (0,0), move to neighboring nodes (0,1).
- From (0,1) move to (0,2), and so on.
- Following this method using the connections will lead you across a path crossing through (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) and finally reaching (3,3).

Given the maze connections and methods available, the output of the BFS traversal could look like this:

```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

The provided path represents one of the possible solutions assuming a right and efficient traversal according to the BFS strategy laid out, taking advantage of the adjacency list connections. Multiple paths could exist depending on traversal decisions and the nature of the adjacency list.
