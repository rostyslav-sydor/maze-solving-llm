To solve the given maze represented as an adjacency list, we need to determine a path from the specified entry point (origin) to the exit point (target). The maze is laid out as a grid based on the adjacency pairs provided between cells in the format (row, column). Each pair represents connectivity between two specific points in the maze. 

Here are the adjacencies for understanding:

- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,2)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (0,3) <--> (1,3)
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (0,0) <--> (1,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)

**Origin and Target:**
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)

**Steps to find path (logic explanation):**
1. Convert the adjacencies into a structure like a dictionary for our ease.
2. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm starting from the origin:
   - BFS is chosen because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is suitable here considering each move between connected cells has the same 'weight' or cost.
3. In BFS, maintain a queue to explore each node/cell and track the path using a predecessor dictionary.
4. Begin the BFS from (0,0) and explore its connections, then move to those cells' connections, continuing until reaching the target (3,3) or until all possible paths are explored.
5. Determine the path by retracing cells from the target back to the origin using the predecessor dictionary.

**Execution:**
- Enqueue the origin (0,0). Neighbors: (0,0) -> (1,0).
- Continue exploring outwards, discovering and enqueuing new cells while marking examined cells to avoid revisiting.
- If (3,3) is dequeued, means path is found:
  - Retrace by predecessors to form the path.

**Solution Format:**
Based on logical execution, the maze solution might look like: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The outputted path follows the format, beginning at (0,0) and ending at (3,3) traversing only the linked cells. As such, this path is logical and concrete derived from the given adjacency pairs and BFS strategy without explicitly using any code. It ensures exploration of the shortest route in terms of the number of movements, given that all moves have the same importance and the graph is unweighted.
