To find a path in the given maze from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3), we need to construct the adjacency list into a more readable format and use a typical graph traversal technique, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

#### 1. **Constructing the Graph**:
   Given in the problem, the adjacency list looks like this (directed edges shown in simple pairs):
   ```
   (1,3) <-> (1,2); (0,2) <-> (0,3); (2,2) <-> (3,2);
   (1,0) <-> (0,0); (1,1) <-> (1,2); (0,1) <-> (0,0);
   (2,3) <-> (3,3); (1,3) <-> (2,3); (1,0) <-> (2,0);
   (3,3) <-> (3,2); (3,1) <-> (3,0); (2,1) <-> (2,0);
   (1,3) <-> (0,3); (0,1) <-> (1,1); (3,2) <-> (3,1);
   ```

#### 2. **Graph Traversal**:
   Using BFS:
   - **Start** at the origin point `(0,0)`.
   - **Enqueue** this starting vertex and mark it as visited.
   - For each step, dequeue a vertex:
     - **Check** all its adjacent vertices. If an adjacent vertex has not been visited, mark it, and enqueue it.
     - Mark each edge as traversed once visited.
   - When you reach the `(3,3)`, you stop and trace back your steps from this vertex to construct the path.

#### 3. **Trace Path**:
   Once the exit `(3,3)` is reached, trace the path backward using either a parent tracking map or direct backtrack until you reach `(0,0)`.

Considering the given adjacency in a less formal but clear traversal order:
- Start BFS from `(0,0)`, connecting to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
- From `(1,0)` can go to `(2,0)`.
- From `(2,0)` can go to `(2,1)`.
- From `(2,1)` can go to `(3,1)`, then from there to `(3,2)`, and then to `(3,3)`.
  
#### 4. **Path Output**:
Merging the above-traced path into the desired format:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path sequentially connects the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` moving through available edges as defined in your adjacency list, ensuring each move is directly connected as dictated by the maze's structure.
