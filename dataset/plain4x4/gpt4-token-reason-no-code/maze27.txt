To solve the maze described as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, a breadth-first search (BFS) approach would be efficient. BFS uses a queue to systematically explore levels of the adjacency graph, marking each node with its preceding node to backtrack the path once the target is reached.

Here are the steps to find the path:

1. **Parse the Adjacency List:**
   Convert the adjacency list into a format that can be easily manipulated programmatically, typically a dictionary where each key represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of connected vertices.
   ```
   Adjacency Dict:
   {
     (0,0): [(1,0)],
     (1,0): [(2,0), (0,0)],
     (2,0): [(3,0), (1,0)],
     (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)],
     (3,1): [(3,2), (2,1), (3,0)],
     (3,2): [(3,3), (2,2), (3,1)],
     (2,2): [(1,2), (3,2)],
     (1,2): [(1,3), (2,2)],
     (1,3): [(1,2), (0,3), (2,3)],
     (2,3): [(1,3), (3,3)],
     (3,3): [(2,3)],
     (0,1): [(1,1), (0,2)],
     (1,1): [(2,1), (0,1)],
     (2,1): [(3,1), (1,1)],
     (0,2): [(0,1)],
     (0,3): [(1,3)],
   }
   ```

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Start at the origin `(0,0)`, marking it as visited.
   - Use a queue to store the nodes to be explored; initialize it by enqueuing the origin.
   - Continue to dequeue nodes from the queue, and for each node, enqueue its unvisited adjacent nodes and mark them as visited. Additionally, record a predecessor link from each adjacent node back to the current node.
   - Stop the process when the target `(3,3)` is dequeued.

3. **Backtrack to Find Path:**
   Once the target `(3,3)` is reached, backtrack using the predecessor links from the target to the origin, creating a sequence of steps taken to reach the target.

4. **Output the Path:**
   Display the path from the origin to the target in the desired format,
   ```
    <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```

Using BFS ensures that the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this is found, which is efficient given the connections stated in the adjacency list. After extracting the adjacencies from the list and converting it into a dictionary form, implementing BFS specifically targets finding the earliest reachable point in the fewest steps, suitable for solving mazes with one path to an exit.
