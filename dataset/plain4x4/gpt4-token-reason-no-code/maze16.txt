Given the adjacency list of the maze and the designated entry and exit points, we need to find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)`.

### Adjacency List Parsing:
Here's the breakdown of the connections:
- `(2,1) <--> (1,1)`
- `(0,3) <--> (1,3)`
- `(2,2) <--> (1,2)`
- `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`
- `(0,3) <--> (0,2)`
- `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`
- `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`
- `(3,2) <--> (3,1)`
- `(2,2) <--> (2,1)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,0)`
- `(3,3) <--> (2,3)`
- `(3,1) <--> (3,0)`
- `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
- `(2,3) <--> (1,3)`

### Pathfinding Approach:
Using a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or Dijkstra's, we can find a path from the origin to the target:

1. Starting from `(0,0)`, get the immediate neighbors from the adjacency list. Neighbor: `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, next accessible coordinate `--> (0,2)`.
3. From `(0,2)`, next accessible coordinate `--> (0,3)`.
4. From `(0,3)`, next accessible coordinates are `(1,3)` due to direct adjacency.
5. From `(1,3)`, explore neighboring coordinates `--> (2,3)`.
6. From `(2,3)`, the next accessible coordinate `--> (3,3)` which is our target.

Given this set of moves, we can determine that a viable path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` is:

### Path Output:
The path to be taken in order can therefore be outputted as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Conclusion:
The solution provided traverses through available paths determined by the adjacency connections. Starting from the origin, we followed a logical exploration of connected nodes until reaching the target node. Each move is legitimized by checking available connections given in the adjacency list.
