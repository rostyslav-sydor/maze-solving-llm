To find the solution to the maze described by the given adjacency list, let’s analyze the connections and identify a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

The adjacency list provides us all direct connections between each coordinate in the maze. We need to start from the origin coordinate and navigate through these connections to reach the target. We use a graph traversal algorithm like BFS or DFS here, in a theoretical approach since no code is expected. Here's a reasoning for how the solution could be approached:

### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)
- Connections from adjacency list with each coordinate like (x,y) <--> (a,b)

### Step 2: Initialize the Search
- Start from origin coordinate (0,0).

### Step 3: Explore Paths
- From (0,0), you can go to (1,0) since (1,0) <--> (0,0) exists.
- From (1,0), options include (2,0) or (0,0) or (1,1). We’ll avoid (0,0) to prevent loops.
- From (2,0), move next to (3,0) due to (3,0) <--> (2,0).
- From (3,0), go to (3,1) per (3,0) <--> (3,1).
- From (3,1), use (3,2) following (3,1) <--> (3,2).
- From (3,2), finally reach (3,3) via (3,2) <--> (3,3).

No backtracking needed in this solution path as each step provided a continuous path towards the target.

### Step 4: Output the Path
With each clear step identified to reach from origin to target, the output would now be framed in requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This suggests a straightforward connection from the starting point to the goal without having to navigate back and forth through any points multiple times, making it a clear and direct route based on the provided adjacency relations.
