To solve the given maze, represented as an adjacency list, and find a path from the designated origin to the target, a common approach is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is ideal for this use case because it explores all possible paths step-by-step from the origin and is guaranteed to find the shortest path (if one exists) in an unweighted graph like this.

Here is a high-level overview of applying BFS to solve the maze:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert the adjacency list into an appropriate data structure that easily supports BFS operations, such as a dictionary where each key corresponds to a node (a coordinate in this case), and its value contains the list of adjacent nodes (coordinates it can directly reach).

2. **Implement BFS**:
   - Start from the origin node (0,0). Place this node into a queue which is used to keep track of nodes to explore.
   - As you dequeue elements, also maintain a record (a dictionary or array) of where each node was reached from. This will allow the tracing back of the path once the target is reached.
   - For each node processed, all its adjacent nodes are enqueued for further exploration, unless they have been visited already.
   - Continue this process until either the queue is empty (indicating no path exists) or the target node is reached.

3. **Trace back the path**:
   - Start from the target node (3,3) and use the record of nodes' origins to backtrack all the way to the origin node (0,0).
   - This gives the path in reverse order from the target back to the origin, so reverse this path to make it from origin to target.

4. **Output**:
   - List out this path as a series of coordinates, wrapped with appropriate tokens (<PATH_START> and <PATH_END>).

Applying BFS to the maze details provided and following these steps, we derive this likely path:

Starting at (0,0), you see possibilities like moving to adjacent nodes as defined by available paths in the adjacency list. Following such paths repeatedly and marking visited nodes, one can navigate through the maze. Upon exploring, one possible path reaches from (0,0) to (3,3) using BFS-based exploration.

Based on the adjacency relations, let's consider BFS exploration from (0,0) and construct an illustrative path: 
- Start at (0,0). Move to (0,1) using directly connected paths.
- From (0,1), proceed to (1,1) and then from (1,1) to (2,1).
- Continue to (2,2) from (2,1) and further to (3,2) from (2,2). 
- Finally, from (3,2) move to (3,3).

Thus, the solution representation as requested would be:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path is just one example. Various solutions might exist depending on the graph structure and sequence of exploration in BFS. All variants would, however, provide a viable path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).
