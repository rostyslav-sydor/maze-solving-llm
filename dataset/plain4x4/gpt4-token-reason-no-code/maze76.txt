To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list gives us the direct connections between points in the maze, and we can use this information to outline a path.

We can use a graph traversal method like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is suitable for unweighted graphs like this one, as it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

1. **Starting Point**: (0,0) - Given as the origin in the maze.

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is described using the pairs in the adjacency list.
   - From (0,0) we can go to (1,0).
   - From (1,0) we can go to (2,0) and (0,0).
   - Continue this for all nodes to get the possible moves based on direct connections.

3. **Traverse the Graph**: Use the BFS starting from (0,0):
   - Initialize with (0,0).
   - Explore all adjacent nodes, then the nodes adjacent to those, and so on.
   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops.

4. **Path Recording**: As you traverse, record the path taken to reach each node from the start node.

5. **Find Target Node**: Once you reach the target (3,3), backtrack using the recorded paths to determine the exact path.

**Detailed Path Explanation**:
   - Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) which is connected directly.
   - From (1,0), go to (2,0).
   - Move from (2,0) to (3,0).
   - Go from (3,0) to (3,1) and then from (3,1) to (3,2).
   - Finally, move from (3,2) to (3,3) â€“ the endpoint.

The path will therefore be: 

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path utilizes the connections provided by the adjacency list, ensuring a correct route is followed from the start to the end point, reflecting the minimum number of moves to reach the goal in the maze as described. Such a path assumes each possible route is explored, choosing the shortest one according to the BFS strategy.
