To solve the maze as presented in the adjacency list format, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). A suitable algorithm to tackle this problem is the Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This way, the first path we find that reaches the target is guaranteed to be one of the shortest possible paths, which is essential in maze-solving.

Here are the steps taken to process the problem and find the solution:

1. **Parse the adjacency list** to convert it into a graph representation. The format marks the adjacency list starting with `<ADJLIST_START>` and ending with `<ADJLIST_END>`.
   Each pair describes a bidirectional connection between points in the maze.

2. **Convert the graph** into a usable data structure such as a dictionary of sets. This allows us to easily check connected vertices and explore them. Each key in the dictionary would represent a node in the maze, and the values would be sets of connected nodes.

3. **Identify origin and target** coordinates from the tokens. Here, origin (`<ORIGIN_START>`) is (0,0) and target (`<TARGET_END>`) is (3,3).

4. **Implement BFS**:
   - Initialize a queue with the origin node and mark it as visited.
   - As long as the queue is not empty, dequeue an item. If this item is the target node, then you have reached the destination.
   - For the current node, explore all connected nodes (neighbors). If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, store the path that led to it (for backtracking the path once the target is reached), and enqueue it.

5. **Backtrack the path** once the target is found. This could be efficiently managed by storing the predecessor of each node in a separate dictionary, helping to track the sequence from target to origin.

6. **Output the path** between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.

Here's an example path found for the described maze:
BFS will explore neighbors layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found due to uniform cost of movement between nodes. Once BFS locates (3,3) starting from (0,0), path reconstruction will help trace back the path using the predecessor storage.

Assuming a solution is found, the output format would resemble:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path represents one of the possible shortest sequences of moves from the origin to the destination in the stated maze.
