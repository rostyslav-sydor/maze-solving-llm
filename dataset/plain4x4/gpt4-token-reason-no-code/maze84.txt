To solve the given maze presented as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we will utilize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This approach is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze.

Here is a logical reasoning to deduce the path:

1. **Start** at the origin: Begin at vertex `(0,0)`.

2. **Adjacency List Conversion**: As given, the graph representation through adjacency list is as follows:

   ```
   (2,1) <--> (3,1)
   (3,1) <--> (3,2)
   (1,2) <--> (2,2)
   (3,3) <--> (3,2)
   (1,1) <--> (1,2)
   (1,0) <--> (0,0)
   (0,2) <--> (0,3)
   (2,3) <--> (1,3)
   (3,3) <--> (2,3)
   (1,3) <--> (1,2)
   (3,0) <--> (3,1)
   (0,1) <--> (0,2)
   (1,0) <--> (2,0)
   (1,1) <--> (0,1)
   (2,0) <--> (2,1)
   ```

   - Convert this list into a more usable graph format where each node lists its direct neighbors.

3. **BFS Application**: Apply the BFS algorithm which involves:
   
   - Marking the initial vertex `(0,0)` visited and enqueue it.
   - Continually dequeue a vertex from the queue, then enquire and enqueue all its unvisited adjacent nodes until the target `(3,3)` is reached or the queue is empty.

4. **Path Reconstruction**: During the BFS traversal, maintain a record of each node's parent (i.e., the node from which it was discovered). This will allow us to reconstruct the path by tracing back from the target `(3,3)` node to the start `(0,0)` using these parent links.

5. **Shortest Path Identification**: Using the parent links, start at `(3,3)` and trace back to `(0,0)`. This reconstruction gives the shortest path due to the nature of BFS which ensures that when a node is first visited, it's via the shortest path.

### Resulting Path

Based on the reconstruction from the BFS and tracing back from `(3,3)` to `(0,0)`:

```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
```

This sequence forms the shortest path from the entry to the exit in the maze, visiting each coordinate once from the start to the target following the connections defined in the adjacency list.

### Output

Packed in the required output format, this sequence will be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This constitutes a coherent solution deduced logically using BFS on the adjacency list to navigate the maze successfully from entry `(0,0)` to exit `(3,3)`.
