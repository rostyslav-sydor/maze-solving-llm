To find a solution (path) through the maze from the given origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we interpret the adjacency list which outlines how each point (node) in the maze is connected to others. Based on the connections (edges), we can navigate through the maze. The approach here would employ a basic graph traversal method such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a pathway from the origin to the target, considering the points and their interconnections as a graph structure.

Here's how the traversal might look conceptually:

1. Start from the origin (0,0).
2. Check the adjacency list for pathways from (0,0); we see it connects to (1,0) and (0,1).
3. Choose a path, for instance, (0,0) to (0,1) first.
4. Continue from (0,1) to its connections; in the adjacency list, (0,1) is linked to (1,1).
5. Proceed to (1,1) and check its connectivity; it connects to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), we could then move to (2,2).
7. From (2,2), look for next connections; however, you need to find a path to bridge towards (3,3). So, backtrack slightly or explore a parallel pathway for better connectivity towards (3,3). From (2,2), back to (1,2) then (1,3).
8. From (1,3), move to (0,3).
9. Then from (0,3), move to (2,3) as an effective connection.
10. From (2,3), directly transition to (3,3) which is the target.

Thus, the path could follow these sequential steps connecting these points through the allowed paths from the adjacency list.

Considering the pathway through the maze graphically ensures you find a valid path without returning or creating cycles, provided the maze isn't designed with one-way paths or dead ends noted explicitly beyond connectivity.

To express the path you've conceptualized:
- `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This presents a sequence of moves through the maze from the start to the end that adheres to the adjacency connections provided and achieves the target of reaching (3,3) from (0,0).
