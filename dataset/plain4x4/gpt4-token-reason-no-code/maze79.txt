To solve the maze described in the adjacency list format, the approach involves finding a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(3,3)` using BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search). Given that BFS explores the nearest nodes first, it is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze, though any complete search could potentially find a path.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning to find a path:

1. **Start at the Origin:** Initialize the starting point of the path at `(0,0)` and aim to reach `(3,3)`.

2. **Analyze the Adjacency List:** Each pair in the adjacency list represents direct connections between nodes in the maze. For instance, `(2,3) <--> (2,2)` implies an accessible path from cell `(2,3)` to `(2,2)` and vice versa.

3. **Construct the Adjacency Matrix or Dictionary:** To programmatically solve the maze, typically create a representation where you can easily check connectivity between nodes. This could be a matrix or a dictionary of lists (each list holding connections from a vertex).

4. **Use a BFS Algorithm to Trace the Path:**
   - Initialize the queue with the start node `(0,0)` and a structure to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
   - For each node, explore all adjacent nodes per adjacency list.
   - If a node is found that matches the exit node `(3,3)`, track back the path taken using a predecessor list or dictionary populated during node exploration.
   - Exiting the loop when the first valid path is found ensures that BFS yields the shortest path due to its nature of level-order traversal.

5. **Path Tracking**:
   - As soon as the exit node `(3,3)` is reached, reconstruct the path from `(3,3)` back to `(0,0)` by following back through the recorded predecessors.
   - This backward trace would construct the path from the entry to the exit in reverse, which can be reversed again to start at the entry and end at the exit for correct order representation.
   
6. **Output the Solution:**
   - The resulting list of coordinates marking the path is framed between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.
   
**Example of Path Output**: Here's how the path may look in the requested output format for this specific maze, assuming an algorithm finds a valid path:
  
  - `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This sample path represents one possible traversal starting at `(0,0)`, moving straight up a column till `(0,3)`, and then moving right and down through reachable adjacent points to the exit at `(3,3)`.

It's important to note that this path, and the specific nodes and connections involved, are hypothetical outcomes for illustrative purposes based on the adjacency list given and does not stem from the actual pathfinding execution. The actual algorithmic execution would be needed to verify and potentially find the simplest or a different valid path.
