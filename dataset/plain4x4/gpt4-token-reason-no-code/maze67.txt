To solve this maze, we start by understanding the maze's structure by looking at its adjacency list format. 

1. First, identify that the origin starting point is labeled as `(0,0)` and the target or exit point is `(3,3)`.
   
2. Next, parse the adjacency list and reconstruct the maze in a graphical or matrix form to better visualize connections and paths:
   - Each pair of the format `(x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2)` indicates a direct connection between the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) within the maze.

3. From the parsed adjacency list:
   - You can move:
     - from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
     - from `(0,1)` to `(0,0)`, `(0,2)`, and `(1,1)`.
     - and similarly for other coordinates as viewed in the adjacency list.

4. Begin at the specified origin `(0,0)` and search for a path that leads to the target `(3,3)`, using a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). 

5. By following BFS for simplification (since it searches level by level, it's likely to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this maze):
   - Starting from `(0,0)`, explore neighbors `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
   - From `(0,1)`, explore further to `(0,2)` and `(1,1)`.
   - Continue this exploration checking nodes layer by layer until `(3,3)` is reached.

6. Continuously track visited nodes to avoid cycles and record paths traversed to backtrack or trace the route once the destination is reached.

7. After tracing through the map, an example of a valid path found can be:
   - Initially from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)`, then to `(2,0)`, then to `(3,0)`, next to `(3,1)`, then tube `(3,2)`, and finally reaching `(3,3)`.

The output sequence in the format as requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents the path from the origin to the target through valid connections in the adjacency list provided, ensuring all moves are legal as per the maze connections established.
