To solve the maze presented in adjacency list format, we can model it as a graph problem where each grid point (cell) in the maze corresponds to a node in the graph, and any connection between two points represents an edge. The objective is to find a path from the starting point (origin) to the ending point (target) traversing through connected cells.

From the adjacency list provided:

- Entry point (origin) is (0,0)
- Exit point (target) is (3,3)
- The paths between nodes (cells) are:
  - (1,1) <--> (1,0)
  - (2,0) <--> (3,0)
  - (1,1) <--> (1,2)
  - (2,1) <--> (2,2)
  - (3,1) <--> (3,2)
  - (3,3) <--> (2,3)
  - (0,0) <--> (0,1)
  - (1,3) <--> (2,3)
  - (1,2) <--> (1,3)
  - (3,1) <--> (3,0)
  - (0,2) <--> (0,1)
  - (3,2) <--> (3,3)
  - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
  - (1,1) <--> (2,1)
  - (0,3) <--> (0,2)

Given this structure, you can solve the maze course using a breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), or other pathfinding algorithm such as Dijkstra's or A* (A-star), which are well-suited for grid/graph-based pathfinding problems, emphasizing BFS here, popular for its efficacious way to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

**Using BFS Approach:**

- **Step 1**: Start at the origin (0,0).
- **Step 2**: From each node visited, visit all its adjacent nodes that have not yet been visited and enqueue them.
- **Step 3**: For each node, keep track of its parent (or previous node), so you can trace back the route once you arrive at the target.
- **Step 4**: Continue this process until you find the target node (3,3) or exhaust all possible paths.
- **Step 5**: Once the target is found, backtrack using the parent pointers from the target node to the origin to extract the route.

**Tracing the path from (0,0) to (3,3) using the adjacency list:**

1. Start at (0,0), traverse to (0,1) then to (0,2) and onto (0,3).
2. From (0,3), backtrack to connected nodes until a step forward can be found (none in this scenario, you need another jump).
3. Jump vertically to (1,3) using connection (1,3) <--> (0,3) if reverse connections are assumed. If not, an alternative longer path must be used:
   - From (0,0), move to (1,0) and then to (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3).
4. From (1,3), proceed to (2,3) and then to (3,3) using established connections.

This results in the path sequence:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (1,0)
- Move to (1,1)
- Move to (1,2)
- Move to (1,3)
- Move to (2,3)
- Finally, reach (3,3)

**Output the path in the required format:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This outlined path is based on hypothetical connections and reasoning through the adjacency list graph, and assumes traversal is allowed both within specified connections and also jumping to nearby rows as permitted by common maze pathfinding. The actual solution path might differ slightly based on specific interpretations and pathfinding strategies deployed.
