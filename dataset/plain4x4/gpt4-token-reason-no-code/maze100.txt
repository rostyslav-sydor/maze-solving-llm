To solve the given maze represented as a graph of connected nodes (cell coordinates), a common approach is to utilize breadth-first search (BFS). This method efficiently finds the shortest path between the designated start (origin) and target (exit) points, made feasible by tracing each step taken to ensure that one can backtrack the shortest route once the target is reached.

Given the adjacency list:
- (3,2) connects to (3,1)
- (1,1) connects to (1,2)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (2,3) connects to (2,2)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (1,3) connects to (1,2)
- (0,1) connects to (1,1)
- (1,0) connects to (0,0)
- (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- (0,1) connects to (0,2)
- (3,1) connects to (2,1)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)

And from the tokens, we have:
- Origin at (0,0)
- Target at (3,3)

Using BFS:
1. Start at (0,0), add it to a queue of nodes to explore.
2. Explore each adjacent node, marking each as visited and tracking preceding nodes to reconstruct the path at the end.
3. Check nodes (0,1), (1,0) and continue the next level exploration.
4. Continue exploring their adjacent nodes like (0,2), (1,1) and further, till (3,3) is reached.
5. Once (3,3) is reached, backtrack from (3,3) to (0,0) using the recorded paths, forming the path from origin to target.

Given this method:
- Start from (0,0): Explore (0,1) then (1,0).
- Move to (1,1) through (0,1), then toward (1,2).
- Continue to adjacent (1,3) from (1,2), and reach (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (2,2), then to neighboring (2,1) and move to (3,1) from (2,1).
- Finally, reach (3,2) from (3,1) and make the last move to (3,3).

Reconstruct the breadth-first search exploration path, giving:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Steps and connections follow a direct movement from the known start to the target point using the provided adjacent relations, ensuring each connection leads to an accessible next step according to the adjacency list.
