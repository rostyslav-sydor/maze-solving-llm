To solve the maze described by the adjacency list, we consider it as a graph where each cell coordinate (i,j) represents a node, and each connection between coordinates represents an edge between these nodes. The task is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the maze's connectivity defined by the adjacency list.

Since the adjacency list is unweighted (all movements between connected nodes take equal effort or "cost"), efficient algorithms for shortest path finding in unweighted graphs, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), can be utilised. Here's how BFS can be applied:

1. Start BFS from the origin node (0,0).
2. Each move goes from a current node to a directly connected neighbor, following the connections given in the list.
3. Continue exploration until the target node (3,3) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted.
4. During BFS, maintain a record (usually via a predecessor map) of which node was visited from which node to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.

Following the BFS strategy per the provided adjacency list, you would start from (0,0) and follow the paths step by step as prescribed until you reach the node (3,3). By keeping track of the nodes visited, you can quickly list down the sequence of coordinates from start to destination, providing not only a solution but also ensuring it represents one of the shortest paths to exit the maze (since BFS explores layer by layer, guaranteeing shortest path discovery in an unweighted setup).

Upon examination of the list and applying the BFS algorithm:

1. From (0,0), you can move to (0,1) and also to (1,0).
2. Continue the exploration from both these points, evaluating their subsequent connected nodes:
   - (0,1) leads further to (0,2) and (0,3), following the connected edges.
   - (1,0) connects to (2,0), and from (2,0) you can move further on to (1,0) back to (3,0) and to (2,1).
3. Continue expanding this exploration through all accessible and unvisited nodes until finally reaching the target (3,3), e.g., from (3,0) to (3,1) and further on to (3,2) and (3,3).

Finally, backtrack using the node visitation record from the target to origin to determine the exact path taken:

Since BFS would have discovered the shortest route based on its layer-wise expansion, the example solution following complete BFS exploration, ensuring all possible movements through the adjacency list, would be framed in the `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` format as asked.
