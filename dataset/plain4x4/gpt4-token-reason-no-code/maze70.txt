To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). We can approach this problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm since BFS is effective for unweighted graphs and finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

Here's the thought process and steps to solve the given maze:

1. **Graph Representation**: Start by parsing the adjacency list and converting it into a suitable data structure like a dictionary where each node (a coordinate pair) maps to a list of its directly connected nodes.

2. **Initialize BFS**:
    - Start BFS from the origin point (0,0).
    - Use a queue to assist in BFS exploration, starting by enqueuing the origin point.
    - Use a dictionary to keep track of each node's predecessor to reconstruct the path after reaching the target node. Initialize the predecessor of the origin point to None.

3. **BFS Exploration**:
    - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front node.
    - Explore all adjacent nodes. If an adjacent node has not been visited before, mark it as visited, record its predecessor, and enqueue it.
    - If during this exploration, the target node (3,3) is reached, stop BFS as the shortest path is found.

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
    - Once BFS completes and if the target has been reached, backtrack from the target node using the predecessor dictionary until reaching the origin node. This constructs the path in reverse.
    - Reverse the backward path to get the path from the origin to the target.

5. **Format the Output**: The reconstructed path is enclosed between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens.

Based on the adjacency list provided, using the described BFS approach would lead to exploration and then reconstructing the path as follows:

- Start from (0,0) and explore neighbors to eventually reach (0,3) and then (1,3) and subsequently move towards (2,3) and finally (3,3), exploring many other points on the way but ensuring the shortest path due to the nature of BFS.

So, applying the algorithm correctly given your adjacency data, the output format would be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This sequence represents the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the destination (3,3) according to the adjacency list provided.
