To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, follow these steps:

1. **Construct the Graph**: Represent each pair of coordinates from the adjacency list as nodes in a graph, where each node is connected if mentioned in a pair in the adjacency list.

2. **Set Starting and Ending Points**: From the token information, the origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3). These points serve as the entrance and exit respectively for the maze.

3. **Utilize a Pathfinding Algorithm**: Use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or A* to find the path from the entrance to the exit in the graph. Each pathfinding algorithm has its own advantages, but for simple unweighted mazes, BFS can be effectively used to locate the shortest path.

4. **Execute Pathfinding**:
    - Start the BFS from (0,0) and explore the neighboring nodes according to the adjacency list specification. 
    - Continue exploring until the destination node (3,3) is reached.
    - As nodes are explored, track the path taken to each node using a predecessor map or by reversing the BFS order when the target is found.

5. **Backtrack to Find the Path**: Once the destination (3,3) is directly reached or found in BFS exploration:
    - Start from the destination node and backtrack using the predecessor information or in reverse BFS order.
    - List the sequence of nodes visited from the origin to the destination as a path.

6. **Construct the Result**: Start by noting down the list in the ordered sequence starting from the source (0,0) to the destination (3,3) as specified by the BFS path.

Here's how the solution path might be deduced (assuming the pathfinding finds the shortest route):
- Start BFS from (0,0)
- Move to connected nodes as per adjacency; continue to (1,0) then to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and finally reach (3,3).

**Final Format for the Solution Path**:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
In this response, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) traverses through each node only once, and follows connections dictated by the adjacency list provided.
