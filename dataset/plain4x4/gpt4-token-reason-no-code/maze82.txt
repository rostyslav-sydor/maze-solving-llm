To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list format and find the path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we first need to translate the adjacency list into a more usable structure such as a graph representation where each node represents a point `(x,y)` and edges represent permissible movement between these points.

Given the adjacency list:
- `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
- `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`
- `(1,1) <--> (2,1)`
- `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
- `(2,1) <--> (2,2)`
- `(3,1) <--> (3,0)`
- `(3,2) <--> (3,1)`
- `(1,3) <--> (0,3)`
- `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,0)`
- `(2,3) <--> (3,3)`
- `(1,2) <--> (1,1)`
- `(0,3) <--> (0,2)`
- `(1,2) <--> (1,3)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`

From this adjacency list, we can infer a graph where each coordinate pair represents a node and each entry represents a bidirectional edge.

To find a valid path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` in this graph:
1. **Create** a map of connections from each node using the pairs from the adjacency list. For instance, from the list, `(0,0)` is directly connected to `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.

2. **Use** a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS was chosen here for its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph:
   - Start from `(0,0)`, enqueue it and mark it as visited.
   - Dequeue `(0,0)` and explore its neighbors `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`, enqueuing them and marking each as visited.
   - Follow a similar process for the dequeued nodes: explore all their unvisited neighbors, continuing until the target `(3,3)` is either reached or all possible paths are explored.

3. **Store** the path: As you search the maze, keep track of each node's predecessor. If `(3,3)` is reached, backtrack using these predecessors from `(3,3)` all the way to `(0,0)` to recreate the path.

Following these steps and based on the described adjacency list, BFS would find a path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`. Given the structure of this particular maze, the sequence in visiting nodes and backtracking nodes, the resulting shortest path would be determined. 

Thus, the sequence of coordinates from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` might follow something like this:
- Begin at origin `(0,0)`, visit `(0,1)`, proceed to `(0,2)`, move to `(0,3)`, then go to `(1,3)`, then `(1,2)`, proceed to `(1,1)`, move down to `(2,1)`, go to `(2,2)`, then `(2,3)`, and finally reach `(3,3)`.

Represent that solution sequence in the required output format:

```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
``` 

This method effectively solves the maze, representing the path as a sequence of coordinate pairs from the origin to the destination.
