In order to solve the maze expressed as an adjacency list, it's important first to understand how the nodes of the maze (represented as coordinates) connect with each other. Here, the adjacency list provides pairwise connections which essentially indicate permissible paths between nodes.

Given the structure provided, the entry (origin) point is (0,0) and the exit (target) point is (3,3).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Graph**: We can imagine the adjacency list as constituting a graph where each coordinate pair represents a node and each connection (`<-->`) a bidirectional edge.

2. **Convert to Graph**: From the adjacency list:
    - **(2,3)** connects to **(1,3)** and **(2,2)**
    - **(0,1)** connects to **(0,0)** and **(0,2)**
    - **(1,3)** connects to **(0,3)**
    - **(1,0)** connects to **(0,0)** and **(1,1)**
    - **(1,1)** connects just to **(1,0)**
    - **(2,2)** connects to **(2,3)**, **(1,2)**, and **(3,2)**
    - **(3,3)** connects to **(3,2)**
    - **(3,1)** connects to **(3,2)** and **(2,1)**
    - **(3,2)** connects back to **(3,1)**, **(3,3)**, and **(2,2)**
    - **(0,2)** connects to **(0,3)** and **(0,1)**
    - **(3,0)** connects to **(2,0)**
    - **(2,1)** connects to **(3,1)** and **(2,0)**
    - **(2,0)** connects to **(3,0)** and **(2,1)**

3. **Plan the Pathfinding**: Using tools like BFS (Breath-first search) or DFS (Depth-first search), or even algorithms like A* or Dijkstraâ€™s for optimized pathfinding considering this is an unweighted graph (all edges have the same weight). These algorithms typically store previous nodes to backtrack the path once the target is reached.

4. **Execute the Pathfinding**: When implemented, the algorithm should traverse from (0,0) and by visiting connected nodes, and applying the algorithm until it reaches the target (3,3).

5. **Build the solution path**: Post reaching the target, backtrack using the stored nodes to get the complete path.

### Example Path (Hypothetical)
Given the pathfinding and adjacency details:
- Start at **(0,0)**
- Move to **(0,1)** 
- Move to **(0,2)** 
- Move to **(0,3)**
- Move to **(1,3)** 
- Move to **(2,3)**
- Move to **(2,2)**
- Move to **(3,2)**
- Finally move to **(3,3)**

It's important to note without implementing or running an actual pathfinding algorithm, and given no indication about the presence of any obstacles or specific rules beyond the adjacency, the example provided is based on available connections and may not be the absolute shortest path in practice.

Therefore, the representation of solution:
**<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>**

Remember, this merely sketches out one of the plausible paths given the connections, not accounting for any specific requirements that may further constrain or alter the most feasible solution.
