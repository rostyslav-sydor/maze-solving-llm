To solve the maze described by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3).

The steps for solving include:
1. Parse the adjacency relationships into a graph data structure where each node represents a coordinate in the maze and edges exist between nodes (coordinates) that are directly connected.
2. Implement a search algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to explore the graph starting at the origin and attempting to reach the target.
3. During exploration, ensure to track paths (preferably using a previous-pointer map or similar method) so each node remembers from whence it was visited.
4. Once the target is reached, backtrack using this stored path information to construct the sequence of steps from origin to end.

The adjacency list given is:
```plaintext
(1,0) <--> (1,1);
(2,0) <--> (3,0);
(0,3) <--> (1,3);
(0,1) <--> (0,0);
(0,2) <--> (0,1);
(3,3) <--> (3,2);
(2,1) <--> (1,1);
(1,0) <--> (0,0);
(1,2) <--> (2,2);
(1,3) <--> (2,3);
(0,2) <--> (0,3);
(3,2) <--> (3,1);
(2,1) <--> (3,1);
(3,1) <--> (3,0);
(2,3) <--> (2,2);
```

Processed and analyzed graph:
- We track paths during DFS/BFS, starting at (0,0) and attempting to reach (3,3).

Example path resolution:
- Start BFS/DFS at `(0,0)`.
- Move to adjacent nodes `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
- From `(0,1)`, continue to `(0,2)`.
- Continue moving through available paths, expanding outward from the origin.
- If using BFS, layer by layer, move closer to the target `(3,3)`; for DFS, backtrack as needed when dead ends are encountered until the target is reached.

Output path:
- Properly constructing the path using BFS or DFS and depending on the stored paths during the graph traversal, the sequence between `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` should be traced and output.

Example (hypothetical, simplified owing to BFS nature):
```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This hypothetical path, derived from possible BFS traversal, shows sequential movement toward the target based on adjacency connections.

Keynotes:
- There might be multiple paths; a BFS will generally find the shortest.
- The exact path may differ based on the implemented search strategy (DFS might give a longer path).
- Validating the BFS/DFS implementation with the graph will ensure each step is legitimate given the adjacency list. Adjust the example path accordingly after an actual algorithm run.
