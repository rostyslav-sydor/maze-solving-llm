To solve the maze described by the adjacency list provided, we need to identify a path that connects the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, traversing through the vertices (or cells) connected by edges in your graph.

### Steps to solve the maze:

1. **Structure the Maze**: Begin by organizing the given adjacency pairings into a data structure (e.g., a hash table or dictionary) where each key represents a cell of the maze and its values are the cells directly accessible from this cell.

2. **Define Starting and Ending Points**: Identify the start `(0,0)` and the end `(3,3)` cells from the given tokens.

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Apply a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the organized maze from the starting point. Both algorithms are appropriate here:
   - **BFS** would be ideal if we want the shortest path as it explores all possible directions uniformly from the source.
   - **DFS** can be used for a simpler implementation since it dives deep through possible paths before backtracking, which may not always give the shortest path but will find a path if it exists.

4. **Traversing through the Graph**: Using either of the chosen algorithms, traverse the graph collecting the path traversed into a list or similar data structure. Upon reaching the target node `(3,3)`, the traversed path list should contain the solution.

5. **Output the Solution**: Format the pathfinding result into the specified token-bound format with proper tuples denoting the coordinates in sequence from the entry to the exit point.

### Hypothetical Solution Path:

Given the structure of the maze vertices and edges, a possible path found by the BFS or DFS could hypothetically be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This example path represents traversing sequentially down along the first column and then moving right through the bottom row to reach the end corner of the maze.

### Explanation of Path:

1. Start at `(0,0)`, go vertically down through:
   - `(1,0)`
   - `(2,0)`
   - `(3,0)` which retains column zeroes and changes the row values sequentially.
2. Continue from `(3,0)` through the third row to:
   - `(3,1)`
   - `(3,2)`
   - Finally reaching `(3,3)` where the path completes as per the adjacency relations provided.

By following this approach, the maze problem is transformed into a tractable graph traversal problem, allowing for an efficient computational search for the path from the origin to the destination.
