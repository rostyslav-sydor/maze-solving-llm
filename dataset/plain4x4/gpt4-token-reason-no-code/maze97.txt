To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we need to follow a systematic approach. Essentially, the problem is to find a path from the origin coordinate to the target coordinate in a graph where each node represents a coordinate in the maze and each edge represents a direct connection between two coordinates.

Here's the process I will follow to describe the solution:

1. **Interpret the Graph:**
   The adjacency list represents a graph where each pair of connected tuples (coordinates) represents an edge:
   
   - (1,2) <--> (2,2)
   - (0,3) <--> (0,2)
   - (3,2) <--> (3,3)
   - (3,1) <--> (2,1)
   - ...
   
   From this, we can visualize a grid or maze layout with connections specified.

2. **Origin and Target:**
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

3. **Graph Algorithm:**
   To find a path, we may use Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or any pathfinding algorithm like A* or Dijkstra, suitable for unweighted grids where BFS is efficient. In this explanation, a BFS-like approach suits well as we traverse sequentially from the origin, exploring each neighbor until we reach the target.

4. **Generate Path:**
   Starting from the origin (0,0), explore connected nodes:
   
   - Start at (0,0). From (0,0), go to (0,1) and (1,0).
   - From (0,1), we can go to (1,1).
   - From (1,0), we can extend to (2,0).
   - From (2,0), we can reach (2,1).
   - From (2,1), we can reach (3,1).
   - From (3,1), step to (3,2) and then (3,3).
   
   Each step explores all direct neighbors (connected nodes), continuing until the target (3,3) is reached in the described sequence, ensuring no coordinate is revisited to avoid loops.

5. **Path Output:**
   Following the connections step-by-step (from origin to target), you traverse the nodes representing the shortest route:

   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path directly connects the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using available paths as denoted in the adjacency list. Note that the actual traversal might differ slightly based on the exploration sequence of nodes in a chosen algorithm like BFS, but the core method of exploring neighbors and marking visited nodes remains foundational.
