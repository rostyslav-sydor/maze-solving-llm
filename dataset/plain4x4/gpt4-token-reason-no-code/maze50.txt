To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, our goal is to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is effective for unweighted graph traversal and finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Start from the Origin**: Begin at the origin coordinate (0,0).

2. **Explore Neighbors**: From each position or node, explore connected nodes or "rooms" as per the adjacency list, marking nodes as visited and keeping track of the path taken using a queue.

3. **Queue Operations**: For each explored node, enqueue its connected/adjacent nodes unless they are already visited. Also, keep track of the route taken by associating each node with its predecessor.

4. **Check for Target**: For each dequeued node, check if it is the target node (3,3). If it is, trace back the path from the target to the origin using the recorded predecessors for each node.

5. **Construct the Path**: By tracing back from the target node to the origin using node predecessors, construct the path list.

6. **Output the Path**: Present the path from the origin to the target.

### Adjacency List (simplified interpretation from input):
- (0,0) connects to [(0,1)]
- (0,1) connects to [(0,0), (0,2)]
- (0,2) connects to [(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)]
- (0,3) connects to [(0,2), (1,3)]
- (1,1) connects to [(2,1)]
- (1,2) connects to [(0,2)]
- (1,3) connects to [(0,3), (2,3)]
- (2,0) connects to [(2,1), (3,0)]
- (2,1) connects to [(1,1), (2,0)]
- (2,2) connects to [(2,3), (3,2)]
- (2,3) connects to [(1,3), (2,2), (3,3)]
- (3,0) connects to [(3,1), (2,0)]
- (3,1) connects to [(2,1), (3,2)]
- (3,2) connects to [(3,1), (2,2)]
- (3,3) connects to [(2,3)]

### Breadth-First Search Execution:
Starting from (0,0), using BFS:
- Visit (0,1) from (0,0)
- Visit (0,2) from (0,1)
- Visit (0,3) from (0,2)
- Visit (1,3) from (0,3)
- Visit (2,3) from (1,3)
- Visit (3,3) from (2,3)

### Shortest Path:
From the execution above, the shortest path in terms of "hops" between nodes from (0,0) to (3,3) is detailed.

### Output Formatted Path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This output confirms that in a stepwise manner we can traverse the maze according to the provided adjacency list from the starting point to the destination without any loops or backtracking.
