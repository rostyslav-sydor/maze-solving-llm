To solve the maze given in the form of an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3). We translate the tokenized adjacency list into a more systematic layout to better visualize and process the graph connections:

### Adjacency List (Readable Format)
- (2,1) <-> (1,1), (3,1)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0), (2,1)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2), (0,3), (0,1)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3), (0,2), (2,2)
- (3,1) <-> (2,1), (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1), (2,0)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2), (1,3)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2), (2,3)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3), (3,3)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1), (0,0)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3), (3,2)
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3), (3,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (2,0) <-> (3,0)

### Origin and Destination:
- Start: (0,0)
- End: (3,3)

### Logical Steps for Solution:
1. Begin at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all possible routes using the connections provided.
3. Track visited nodes to avoid redundant paths and loops.
4. Progressively move toward the destination, prioritizing paths that lead towards (3,3) if there's a choice.

### Pathfinding Strategy:
- A typical approach here would be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms since they are well-suited for such tasks in unweighted graphs (mazes).
- Utilize a queue (BFS) or a stack (DFS) to assist in exploring nodes.
- As each node is visited, check if it's the target; if not, continue to its neighbors.
  
### Solution Path:
Starting from (0,0), we trace the path:
- Start at (0,0) moves to (1,0) via adjacency connection.
- From (1,0) move to: (1,1)
- From (1,1) move to: (2,1)
- From (2,1) move to: (3,1) 
- From (3,1) move to: (3,2)
- From (3,2) move to: (3,3), which is the destination.

Announcing the solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

### Conclusion:
This path proceeds in a generally sensible, mostly direct manner, utilizing the adjacency connections between nodes. It takes into account exploration and backtracking where necessary while adhering to the predefined graph structure. 
The chosen BFS or DFS mechanism assists in systematically exploring each route without redundancies due to its inherent design for unweighted graphs, ensuring efficient navigation through the maze.
