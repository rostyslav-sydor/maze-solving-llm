To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we use a graph traversal algorithm to find a path from the origin coordinate `(0,0)` to the target coordinate `(3,3)`. The graph traversal techniques most applicable are Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, BFS is chosen for its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is suitable for a maze-solving scenario.

### Approach:

1. **Parsing the Adjacency List**
   - Start by converting the adjacency list of connections between coordinates into a usable form. This would typically be a dictionary where each key represents a node (coordinate), and its value is a set or list of connected nodes.

2. **Initialization**
   - Establish the BFS starting point, `(0,0)`, and a queue mechanism to track nodes to visit — `queue = [(0,0)]`.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of each node’s parent to reconstruct the path once the target is reached. Start with `parent = {(0,0): None}`.

3. **BFS Traversal**
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a node (current position) and check if it is the target `(3,3)`. If it is, reconstruct and output the path using the parent dictionary.
     - If not the target, enqueue all directly connected but unvisited nodes, and mark these nodes as visited by recording their parent node.

4. **Path Reconstruction**
   - Upon reaching the target node during BFS, backtrack from the target node `(3,3)` to the origin `(0,0)` using the parent relationship to reconstruct the path taken. Store this path in a list.

5. **Output**
   - Format the path list to fit the required output format and print it.

### Visualization and Output:

Traversing the graph using BFS will encounter the coordinates in levels:
- Start at `(0,0)`.
- Then visit neighbors and continue. 
- Upon reaching `(3,3)`, backtrack using the parent pointers to extract the path.

The sorted path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` through the maze, using BFS while considering all immediate connections and backtracking from the target, is arranged in a path list.

### Solution:

Assuming BFS and path reconstruction are successfully performed based on the adjacency list, the chosen format to return will be:
```plaintext
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
This path is illustrative; the exact path depends on the BFS processing order and connections specified in the adjacency list data. Hence, you might have alternate valid paths depending on numerous factors like node processing order in the BFS queue.
