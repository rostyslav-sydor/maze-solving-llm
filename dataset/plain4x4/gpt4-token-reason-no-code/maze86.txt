To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3). The maze structure and connections, as defined by the adjacency list, appear complex, but we can break down the solution by understanding the connectivity between various points (nodes) and subsequently finding a viable path between the start (origin) and the end (target).

Here's a detailed step-by-step breakdown of how we would solve the maze:

### Analysis of the Adjacency List:
From the provided adjacency list, we can extract the following connections:
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (2,2) <--> (2,3)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (1,0) <--> (1,1)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (1,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,1)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)

### Plan to Solve the Maze:
Using these connections, the goal is to find a path from (0,0) to (3,3). Hereâ€™s the potential path:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) using (0,1) <--> (0,0).
3. Move from (0,1) to (0,2) using (0,2) <--> (0,1).
4. Move from (0,2) to (1,2) using (1,2) <--> (0,2).
5. Move from (1,2) to (2,2) using (1,2) <--> (2,2).
6. Move from (2,2) to (2,3) using (2,2) <--> (2,3).
7. Move from (2,3) to (3,3) using (2,3) <--> (3,3).

This sequential transition through each coordinate, based on the connections available in the adjacency list, ensures a continuous path from the origin to the target.

### Summarize Path:
With each move valid and ensuring connectivity, the summarized path in the required format would thus be:

<Path Output>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This series of moves directly utilizes the linked points in the adjacency list, ensuring a valid path through the maze from the designated origin to the target. Each coordinate set supports the natural flow dictated by the adjacency setup without breaking any connection rule.
