To solve the maze described in the adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can employ a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores all possible locations from the start point and efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as this maze with equal path weights between directly connected nodes.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem:

1. **Convert Adjacency List to Graph Structure**: Translate the list of connections into a more manageable form like a dictionary of lists, where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes to which it's directly connected. For example, `(1,1)` is connected to `[(1,0), (1,2)]`.

2. **Initialize BFS**: Include a queue to keep track of nodes to visit, starting with the origin (0,0), and a set or list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisits and loops. Also, maintain a dictionary to remember the path (specifically, how we reach each visited point).

3. **Perform BFS**:
   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
   - Check all its direct neighbors; if a neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent (the node from which it was discovered), and enqueue it.
   - If the neighbor is the target node (3,3), stop the search.

4. **Reconstruct the Path**: Once we reach the target, reconstruct the path from the target back to the origin using the parent pointers stored during BFS, then reverse it to make it from origin to target.

5. **Format the Output**: Convert the path into the required format with coordinates enclosed in parentheses, separated by spaces, and enclosed between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.

Using such an approach, we start at `(0,0)` and follow the paths defined in the adjacency list:

- Start BFS from `(0,0)`.
- Explore neighbors and discover new nodes `(0,1)` (connected to `(0,0)`) and proceed discovering in BFS manner.
- Continue discovering until reaching `(3,3)` through its neighbors.

Once the target `(3,3)` is reached in our BFS sequence, we trace back the shortest path using the parent relation recorded.

The output in this structured solution using BFS yields:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This format satisfies the requirements of listing the coordinates for the shortest path in the maze between the designated start and target points.
