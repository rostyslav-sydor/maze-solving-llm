To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format without using code but describing the process, let us first analyze the format of the input data and outline steps typically used in maze-solving algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

1. **Graph Representation**: The maze is represented as an undirected graph where each node represents a cell in the maze and each edge represents a passable connection between two adjacent cells. The graph's adjacency list indicates which nodes (cells) are connected.

2. **Identifying Entry and Exit**: The origin (entry point) is given as `(0,0)`, and the target (exit point) is `(3,3)`.

3. **Understanding Connections**:
    The provided adjacency list defines, for example, `(2,3) <--> (3,3)` means from cell `(2,3)` you can go to `(3,3)`, and vice versa. 

4. **Construct the Graph**: Convert the adjacency list into a data structure appropriate for traversing, often this is an actual list or a dictionary where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes (neighbors).

5. **Path-Finding Algorithm** (Conceptual, no code):
    - Start at the origin node `(0,0)`.
    - Use a queue to hold nodes to explore, starting with the origin.
    - Build up a way to track visited nodes to avoid revisiting and looping.
    - Gradually explore each node by pulling from the start of the queue, then enqueue all directly connected, not-yet-visited nodes. For each node, store back-references to know the path taken.
    - Stop when the target node `(3,3)` is dequeued, meaning a path is found.
    - Reconstruct the path from the target back to the origin using the back-references, this will be your solution path.

6. **Solution Path Recreation**:
    Starting from `(0,0)`: Based on the adjacency information, find a possible path. Using a BFS approach might yield the following possible shortest path:
    - Start at `(0,0)` moving to neighboring cells shown in adjacency list.
    - Path: `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)`.

7. **Output**: Finally, the reconstructed path would be formatted as requested:
   `<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`

This output assumes the successful application of BFS to find the shortest path from the origin to the destination using the adjacency list to navigate between nodes.
