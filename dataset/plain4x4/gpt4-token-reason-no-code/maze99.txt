To solve this maze, which is provided as a graph connected by adjacency lists, we start by parsing the list to establish the exact graph structure. The adjacency list format describes which cells in the maze are directly connected to each other:

- Each connection is bidirectional (denoted by `<-->`), indicating movement can occur from one node to the other and vice versa.
- We convert the adjacency list into a graph representation where each node represents a cell position `(r,c)` and each edge represents a valid move between connected cells.

After setting up our graph structure, we need to identify a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`. To find this path, we could use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, as it is optimal for unweighted graphs in finding the shortest path. Depth-first search (DFS) could also be used to explore possible paths, but it may not guarantee the shortest path.

### Parsed Adjacency List:
Drawing lines between each directly connected point, we have:
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1)
- (1,1) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,2) <-> (1,2)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (3,1) <-> (2,1)
- (2,1) <-> (2,0)
- (2,2) <-> (1,2)

### Suggested Solution Using BFS Path:
Starting at `(0,0)`, we explore all adjacent nodes layer by layer:
1. From `(0,0)`, we can move to `(1,0)`.
2. From `(1,0)`, move to `(1,1)`.
3. Continue to `(0,1)` or `(1,1) -> (0,1)`.
4. Then to `(0,2)`.
5. Move to `(1,2)` from `(0,2)`.
6. Continue to `(1,3)` from `(1,2)`.
7. Move to `(2,3)` from `(1,3)`.
8. Reach `(3,3)` from `(2,3)`.

### Detailed Path:
So, following the reasoning and BFS exploration, a valid path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` using the connected routes becomes:
`(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)`.

### Formatted Output:
This path is formatted and delimited as specified:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Each step taken connects directly to the next, ensuring this is not only a valid path but one of the shortest due to the BFS selection mechanism.
