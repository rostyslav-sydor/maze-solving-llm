To solve this maze graph, let's break down the process into clear steps, outlining a method without providing code. The goal is to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided.

### Step 1: Parsing the Adjacency List
First, interpret the adjacency list enclosed between the `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`. Each entry describes pairs of nodes (coordinates in this case) that are directly connected: 
- `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`
- `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`
- `(0,2) <--> (0,3)`
- ...(and so forth for other pairs)

### Step 2: Graph Representation
Represent these connections as a graph where each node is a coordinate and each edge connects directly linked nodes. Since it's an undirected graph, the relationship is bidirectional.

### Step 3: Identify Origin and Target
From the description:
- Origin: `(0,0)`
- Target: `(3,3)`

### Step 4: Pathfinding Algorithm
Implement a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs like this one, allowing us to find the shortest path. As BFS traverses the graph, it explores all nodes at the present "depth" (distance from the source) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

Initialize the BFS with the origin `(0,0)`, marking it as visited. Use a queue to manage nodes to be explored, and a way to track the path back from any node to the origin.

### Step 5: Track and Build the Path
Once BFS reaches the target `(3,3)`, backtrack from the target node to the origin node to reconstruct the path by following the path recorded during BFS exploration.

### Step 6: Representing the Path
The result should represent the path starting from the origin and ending at the target. Enclose the solution in `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>`.

### Step 7: Format the Solution
The final output should look like:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

Here, each coordinate represents steps from the origin to the target taking the shortest route derived by the BFS algorithm.

### Summary
This process effectively translates the graphical maze data into a practical path solution using BFS, ensuring optimal route selection without advanced coding or complex algorithmic implementations. By visually laying out these steps, one could manually solve the maze or understand the BFS approach intuitively.
