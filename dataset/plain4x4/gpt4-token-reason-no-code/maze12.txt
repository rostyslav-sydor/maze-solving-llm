To solve this maze, represented by the given adjacency list, and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's choose BFS due to its properties of finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

We start by interpreting the adjacency list:

1. Parse the adjacency list:
   - (3,0) <--> (2,0)
   - (1,0) <--> (2,0)
   - (3,1) <--> (2,1)
   - (3,3) <--> (3,2)
   - (3,0) <--> (3,1)
   - (2,1) <--> (1,1)
   - (0,2) <--> (1,2)
   - (3,3) <--> (2,3)
   - (2,2) <--> (2,3)
   - (1,2) <--> (1,1)
   - (1,0) <--> (0,0)
   - (0,3) <--> (1,3)
   - (0,2) <--> (0,1)
   - (3,1) <--> (3,2)
   - (2,3) <--> (1,3)

2. Given the origin and target:
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

3. Steps using BFS:
   - Start BFS from the origin (0,0).
   - Enqueue the origin and mark it as visited.
   - Begin exploring its neighbors:
     - Check (1,0) from adjacency list relationship (1,0) <--> (0,0).
   - Continue similar exploration from each node, enqueueing unvisited nodes.

4. Finding the path:
   - We will trace back from the target node (3,3) all the way to the origin (0,0), reversing the order of nodes we visited to get the path from start to finish.

Given the adjacency list, and applying BFS, here's how the approximate pathfinding sequence unfolds:
- Start at (0,0).
- Move to neighboring nodes (1,0).
- From (1,0), traverse to (2,0).
- Move along to neighbor (3,0).
- From (3,0), go upwards to (3,1).
- Continue from (3,1) to (3,2).
- Finally from (3,2) to the target (3,3).

Now, outputting the path from (0,0) to (3,3), walking through all the connecting nodes:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This sequence represents the shortest path from the origin to the target through the connected nodes as given by the adjacency list.
