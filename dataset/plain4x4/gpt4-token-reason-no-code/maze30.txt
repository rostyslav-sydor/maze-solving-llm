To solve the maze given as an adjacency list, we must determine a path that connects the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)` using the connections specified between coordinates.

Here's a breakdown of how to go about solving this:

1. **Graph Interpretation**: Recognize the maze as an undirected graph, where nodes are the coordinates, and edges are the connections (`<-->`) between those coordinates.

2. **Edge List Preparation**: Convert the adjacency list into a more usable form for manually tracing paths:

    - `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`
    - `(0,1) <--> (0,2)`
    - `(0,2) <--> (0,3)`
    - `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`
    - `(1,1) <--> (1,2)`
    - `(1,2) <--> (1,3)`
    - `(1,0) <--> (0,0)`
    - `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
    - `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`
    - `(2,0) <--> (2,1)`
    - `(2,1) <--> (2,2)`
    - `(2,2) <--> (2,3)`
    - `(2,3) <--> (1,3)`
    - `(3,0) <--> (3,1)`
    - `(3,1) <--> (3,2)`
    - `(3,2) <--> (3,3)`

3. **Trace a Path from Origin to Target**:
    - Start from the origin `(0,0)`.
    - Proceed to adjacent nodes, keeping track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
    - Follow potential pathways toward the final target.

4. **Path Identification**:
    - From `(0,0)`, the pathway through `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,3)` is direct but leads to a dead-end at `(0,3)`.
    - Starting over from `(0,0)`, move to `(1,0)`, then `(2,0)`, then `(3,0)`, connecting vertically through the graph.
    - Continue from `(3,0)` to `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, and finally to the target `(3,3)`.

5. **Format Solution Path**:
   - The nodes `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(2,0)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)` are the sequence that leads from the origin to the target.

A systematic search, typically represented in algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search, can rigorously provide such pathways. Here, we deduced the path manually by logically transitioning from point to point based on direct consequences seen in the adjacency list.

Final solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
