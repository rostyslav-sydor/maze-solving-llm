To navigate a solution through the maze, let's first unpack the provided adjacency list and translate it into a readable graph. Each pair of coordinates denotes the passageways between rooms (or cells in the maze):

- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (2,3) <--> (3,3)
- (1,0) <--> (2,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,1) <--> (1,1)

Based on the maze starting and ending points:
- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,3)

We now aim to find a navigable path from the origin to the target.

### Plan:
1. **Create a representation of the maze graph** - Use a dictionary to represent each node and its connected nodes based on the adjacency list.
2. **Conduct a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - These algorithms can be utilized for searching the entire graph, starting from the (0,0) coordinate (origin). Each path search checks if a movement is allowed by referring to the adjacency list if the current node connects to a subsequent node.
3. **Trace the path** - Begin at the entry node (0,0), using the DFS or BFS to explore each connection going ahead, and backtracking when necessary, till the exit node (3,3) is reached.

### Simplified reasoning for maze solution:

- Start at (0,0), options based on adjacency: (0,1).
- From (0,1), options based on adjacency: (0,0), (0,2).
- From (0,2), options based on adjacency: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2).
- Continue navigating the connections, backtracking where no forward paths exist, until (3,3) is reached.

### Conclusion:
Upon analysis and linking all possible paths through the maze, you would eventually plot a roadmap possibly like this: 

```
<PATH_START> 
  (0,0) 
  (0,1) 
  (0,2) 
  (1,2) 
  (1,3) 
  (2,3) 
  (3,3) 
<PATH_END>
```

Here, the path has intuitively traversed from our starting coordinate through the maze, selecting paths ensuring continuous consecutive linkages based on the adjacency list till reaching the destination.
