To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, we first need to interpret it correctly and map it out to understand the connections. The adjacency list gives pairs of connected coordinates, indicating which cells are directly reachable from each other. 

Next, we find a path from the start (origin) to the end (target) location. From the maze description, the origin is at coordinate (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).

To solve this, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, where each step from one coordinate (node) to another has equal cost or weight.

Given the adjacency list, let's establish the graph as nodes with edges based on provided connections:

- (1,2) <-> (1,1)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (3,2) <-> (3,3)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0)
- (1,0) <-> (0,0)
- (2,1) <-> (2,2)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (3,1) <-> (3,2)
- (2,1) <-> (1,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (2,3) <-> (1,3)
- (0,3) <-> (0,2)

Using BFS, we begin at the start point (0,0). We look at all reachable nodes from the start and continue to explore each until we either run out of nodes or reach the target (3,3). 

From the adjacency list, one possible shortest path determined by the BFS approach from (0,0) to (3,3) would proceed as follows:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (1,0) since (0,0) <-> (1,0)
3. Proceed to (2,0) as (1,0) <-> (2,0)
4. Move to (3,0) from (2,0) <-> (3,0)
5. Next, go to (3,1) from (3,0) <-> (3,1)
6. Then to (3,2) from (3,1) <-> (3,2)
7. Finally, proceed to (3,3) from (3,2) <-> (3,3)  

Which would sum up the path as an ordered list of coordinates, starting at (0,0) and finishing at (3,3):
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows the shortest principle by moving directly down the maze's path from the initial to the terminal coordinate, through connected passages. This example assumes open pathways for all directly connected nodes with no barriers beyond the maze's outlined edges and junctions.
