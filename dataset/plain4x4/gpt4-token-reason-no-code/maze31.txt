To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, our task is to find a path between the origin `(0,0)` and the target `(3,3)` using the connections specified. The path will be a sequence of adjacent nodes (coordinates), starting at the origin and ending at the target.

Here are the given connections in a formatted manner:
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (2,1) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (1,0)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (2,3) <--> (1,3)
- (3,0) <--> (3,1)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (0,1) <--> (0,2)
- (0,2) <--> (0,3)
- (1,3) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (3,2)
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (3,2) <--> (2,2)

Given this adjacency list, let us explore a path using a breadth-first or depth-first search technique:

1. Start at the origin `(0,0)`.
2. According to the connections:
   - `(0,0)` is connected to `(0,1)`.
3. From `(0,1)`, move to:
   - `(1,1)`, as it is also connected.
4. From `(1,1)` move to:
   - `(1,0)` or back to `(0,1)`. Choose `(1,0)`.
5. From `(1,0)`, you can go to:
   - `(2,0)`.
6. From `(2,0)`, continue to:
   - `(3,0)` since it's reachable.
7. From `(3,0)`, options are:
   - `(3,1)`.
8. Then at `(3,1)`, the path continues to:
   - `(3,2)`.
9. From `(3,2)`, move to:
   - `(3,3)`, which is our target.

Thus, combining all these paths step-by-step, results in the route from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)`.

Based on the above pathfinding,

Output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves takes us from the entrance to the exit of the maze successfully, ensuring passage through connected paths only.
