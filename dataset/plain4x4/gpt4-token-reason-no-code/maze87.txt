To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we'll follow the steps below:

1. **Parse the Adjacency List:** First, we need to understand the structure of the maze using the adjacency list provided between `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`. This list shows connections between different points (nodes) in the form of edges. Each cell in the maze can be considered as a node in the graph, and each connection (edge) shows which nodes (cells) are directly reachable from which others. 

2. **Define the Graph:** We'll treat each coordinate pair as a node and each direct connection between pairs as an edge in the graph. For example, from the adjacency pair `(3,1) <--> (3,0);`, it can be deduced that from the node at position (3,1), you can directly move to (3,0) and vice versa.

3. **Identify Entry and Exit Points:** The origin or starting point is given between `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>` tags as (0,0). The target or exit point is stated within `<TARGET_START>` and `<TARGET_END>` tags as (3,3).

4. **Find a Path from Entry to Exit:** Using the information from the adjacency list, we can use a pathfinding algorithm to determine how best to reach the target from the origin. For example, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is well-suited for these types of problems as it explores the closest nodes first before moving to those further away. The BFS would start at node (0,0) and follow through the graph exploring each node via its connections as provided until it reaches (3,3). 

5. **Record the Path:** As you implement BFS, keep track of the path taken to reach each node until you reach the target node. A parent mapping might be useful here, where for each node visited you store which node it was visited from. This will allow backtracking from the target node (3,3) back to the origin (0,0) to recover the path.

6. **Output the Path**: Once the path is determined by backtracking, list it sequentially from the starting node to the end node.

The output for our maze based on the adjacency list and the described method would look structurally similar to:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>`. 

The actual path may vary and depends on the exact implementation details of the pathfinding algorithm used. The provided sequence is merely an illustrative example showing a possible route from the start to the finish based on an understanding of the described connections and general maze solving strategies like BFS.
