To solve the maze from the adjacency list provided, a common approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This method works well because it explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that when the destination is found, it's found via the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traveled.

Given the adjacency list and origin and target points:
- Starting at the origin point `(0,0)`.
- The target is point `(3,3)`.

The steps involved in solving the maze using BFS involves:
1. Start at the origin node `(0,0)`.
2. Maintain a queue to keep track of the next node to visit and a set or list to keep track of visited nodes.
3. Push the origin node `(0,0)` into the queue and mark it as visited.
4. Detach the front node of the queue and explore its adjacent nodes as indicated in the adjacency list.
5. For every unvisited adjacent node, mark it visited and enqueue it. Also, keep track of the path that gets to that node (i.e., store the path linkage as a dictionary where the key is the current node, and the value is the predecessor node).
6. Continue this process until the queue is empty, or the target `(`3,3`)` is dequeued, signifying a path is found.

Considering neighbors as defined in our adjacency list, the following sequence would occur:
- Start from `(0,0)`, adding adjacent `(1,0)`.
- From `(1,0)`, add its adjacent `(0,0)` (already visited), no new node added.
- From `(1,0)` again, continue exploring subsequent nodes until all links and connections have been explored.

By following each node through the adjacencies described and the path links we've tracked, we construct the shortest path from the origin to the destination.

##### Example Path (hypothetical order of exploration):
- Starting at `(0,0)` -> Detects `(1,0)`.
- Visiting `(1,0)` -> Adds `(0,0)` (already visited), then discovers other adjacent nodes, etc.
- Continue until `(3,3)` is reached through successive linkages of adjacencies.

##### Hypothetical Resulting Path:
For instance, if the BFS exploration reveals the shortest path:
```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
```

This would mark the sequence of moves (path) from the origin `(0,0)` to target `(3,3)` through the maze.

Expressing this in the required output format:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

It should be noted that BFS was the chosen method because of its broad usage in such maze-solving scenarios and its efficiency in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one. The actual path traversal would depend specifically on the actual exploration order and queued nodes during the BFS execution.
