To solve this maze, we start by understanding the adjacency list that describes a graph. Each node in the graph represents a coordinate point in the maze, and the edges (represented as bidirectional link <--> in the adjacency list) indicate that you can move directly between the two connected coordinate points.

We are asked to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

1. **Convert the Adjacency List to a Graph Representation**:
   By reviewing the adjacency list, we can reconstruct the connections or paths between various points in the maze:
   ```
   (0,0) <--> (0,1)
   (0,1) <--> (0,2)
   (0,2) <--> (0,3)
   (0,3) <--> (1,3)
   (1,0) <--> (1,1)
   (1,1) <--> (1,2)
   (1,2) <--> (1,3)
   (1,3) <--> (2,3)
   (2,3) <--> (2,2)
   (2,2) <--> (2,1)
   (2,1) <--> (2,0)
   (2,0) <--> (1,0)
   (2,0) <--> (3,0)
   (3,0) <--> (3,1)
   (3,1) <--> (3,2)
   (3,2) <--> (3,3)
   ```

2. **Identify the Path**:
   Start from the origin `(0,0)` and traverse the graph based on the links mentioned above. Weâ€™ll pick a viable sequence of connections through the nodes (coordinates) that lead to the target `(3,3)`:
   - From `(0,0)` to `(0,1)` (direct link)
   - From `(0,1)` to `(0,2)` (direct link)
   - From `(0,2)` to `(0,3)` (direct link)
   - From `(0,3)` to `(1,3)` (direct link)
   - From `(1,3)` to `(2,3)` (direct link)
   - Continue to `(3,3)` through linked nodes `(2,3) <--> (3,3)`

3. **Format the Path**:
   Prepare the solution path in the specified listing format by linking these transitively connected nodes:
   ```
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
   ```
This path shows the continuous flow from the origin to the target by stepping through each connection only once and moving from left to right and then bottom row-wise in the maze grid.
