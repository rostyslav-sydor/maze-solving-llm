To solve the maze problem presented as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we can utilize the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is effective for such problems because it explores the vertices layer by layer, ensuring that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze. Here's how to approach the solution:

1. **Graph Representation**: First, convert the adjacency list into a more tractable format, such as a dictionary where each node points to its neighbors:
   ```
   {
     (1, 2): [(1,1)],
     (1, 1): [(1,2)],
     (2, 3): [(3,3), (1,3)],
     (3, 3): [(2,3), (3,2)],
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize BFS**: Start BFS with the origin node `(0,0)` and mark it as visited. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored, and also maintain a dictionary to store the path back from each node to its predecessor.

3. **Explore Nodes**: While the queue isn't empty, dequeue the front node. Check all its neighbors; if a neighbor hasn't been visited, enqueue it, mark it as visited, and record its predecessor. If the neighbor is the target `(3,3)`, then you have found the path.

4. **Construct Path**: Once the target `(3,3)` is reached, construct the path by backtracking using the predecessor dictionary until you reach the origin `(0,0)`.

5. **Output the Path**: Finally, display the path in the specified format, which is from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`.

### Simulation of the BFS Pathfinding:

- **Initialization**: 
  Queue = `[(0,0)]`
  Visited = `{(0,0)}`
  Predecessor = `{}` 

- **Exploration**:
  - Visit `(0,0)` and check neighbors `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
  - Add `(1,0)` and `(0,1)` to the queue and mark visited.
  - Next, dequeue `(1,0)`, check neighbors `(2,0)` and continue similarly till you eventually reach `(3,3)`.
  - At each step, mark nodes as visited and record the path back from each node to its predecessor.

Final BFS Path obtained upon reaching `(3,3)` will be backtracked to create the full path from `(0,0)`.

### Hypothetical Outcome:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This hypothetical path traces one possible route through the maze using the BFS algorithm, which ensures that the path found is one of the shortest paths to the target from the origin, based on the adjacency list provided.
