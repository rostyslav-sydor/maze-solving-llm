To solve the maze given as an adjacency list of coordinates, the approach is to interpret this adjacency list as representing a graph, where each node corresponds to a coordinate position in a grid (x, y), and edges exist between nodes that are directly connected. By using a simplest form of traversal such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or any shortest path algorithm (like Dijkstra's Algorithm if shortest path was needed, however any will suffice as long as it explores all connections), we can determine a path from the starting coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3).

Here is how the problem can be approached:

1. **Extract Nodes and Edges**: Parse the string to convert the adjacency list representations into a more manageable format like a dictionary or a list of tuples for adjacency relationships. 

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each coordinate pair indicates a vertex in your graph.
   - The statement (X) <--> (Y) stands for an undirected edge between vertex X and vertex Y.

3. **Build the Graph**:
   - Create a graph G with vertices being the coordinate pairs.
   - Add edges between vertices as indicated by the adjacency list provided.

4. **Choose a Graph Traversal Algorithm**:
   - Using BFS: Start from the origin coordinate (0,0). BFS is often used for such unweighted graph traversal since it explores all neighbors level-by-level, hence it is also fitting for mazes (where all moves generally have the same cost or weight).
   - Maintain a record of each node visited and the path taken using a queue that stores the node and the path from start to the node.

5. **Traversal**:
   - Initialize your queue with the origin coordinate and an empty path.
   - For each current node being processed, extend to its adjacent nodes if they have not been visited.
   - Add each newly found node along with the path leading to it into the queue.
   - This continues until either the queue is exhausted (meaning no path exists) or the target node is found.

6. **Completion**:
   - Once the target coordinate (3,3) is dequeued, the associated path recorded in the queue becomes the solution to your maze.

7. **Output the Path**:
   - Format and print the path obtained from the graph traversal algorithm between the specified `PATH_START` and `PATH_END` tokens.

Applying these steps in conceptual execution, and upon a successful BFS traversal, it is expected that the algorithm would reach the target (3,3) and traceback would provide the path taken based on the vertices visited. This path is then displayed in the correct coordinate list format.

The output would be similar to:

`<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) ... (3,3) <PATH_END>` 

where the exact coordinates in the middle of the path output would depend on the actual traversal done by the BFS, taking into account the nodes enqueued and dequeued in the process of searching the graph.
