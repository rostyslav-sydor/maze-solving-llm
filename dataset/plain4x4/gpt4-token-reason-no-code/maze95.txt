To find a solution for the given maze, one can use graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Given the maze's layout, BFS is particularly suitable as it would help find the shortest path from the origin to the target in an unweighted graph such as this one.

1. **Representation and Initialization**:
   - Begin by parsing the provided adjacency list into a more usable format, such as a dictionary where each key (node) holds a list of its directly connected neighbors. 

2. **Parsing the Adjacency List**:
   - Nodes such as (3,2), (3,3), (0,2), (0,1), etc., are defined with their respective connections. Translate this into a graph represented perhaps as a dictionary. For example, `{(3,2): [(3,3), (2,2), (3,1)], (0,2): [(0,1), (0,3)], ...}`.

3. **Identify the Start (Origin) and End (Target) Points**:
   - From the tokens, the start is (0,0) and the end is (3,3).
   
4. **Traversing the Graph**:
   - Perform a BFS starting from (0,0). In BFS, maintain a queue that holds nodes to visit along with the path taken to reach them. Start with the queue initialized with `[(0,0)]`. 
   - In each iteration, dequeue a node. If itâ€™s the target node (3,3), the associated path is the solution. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that have not yet been visited, appending the current node to the path recorded for each neighbor.
   - Continue till the queue is empty or the target is found.

5. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Once the target node (3,3) is reached during the BFS, the path associated with it in the queue provides the sequence of moves from the start to the end. If necessary, track the nodes visited during the BFS (using a set or another structure) to ensure every node is processed only once and to prevent cycles.

6. **Output the Found Path**:
   - Format the output as a list of coordinates, surrounded by the `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens.

**Hypothetical Solution**:
Given the functionality of BFS and assuming proper connections represented in the adjacency list are correct, wherein BFS would explore layer-by-layer from the origin, the path discovered might look like this (depending on the exact BFS processing order, there may be multiple shortest paths):

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

The steps, as plotted above, take us from the origin at the bottom-left of the grid step by step up to the top right, each step moving to an adjacent cell as allowed by the adjacency constraints given in the problem description.
