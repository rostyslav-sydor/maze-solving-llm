In order to find a solution to the maze represented as an adjacency list, we need to derive a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). The adjacency list gives us the pairs of directly connected cells, which effectively defines the navigation rules of the maze. We will determine the path using a systematic approach which can be implemented using breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), or another pathfinding algorithm like A*. Since the specific code is not requested, I'll outline a manual approach to derive a solution:

1. **Map Creation**: Convert the adjacency list into a graph representation where each node corresponds to a cell and edges connect directly adjacent nodes as per the adjacency list.

2. **Starting Point**: Our starting point based on the origin token is (0,0).

3. **End Point**: Our destination point as indicated by the target token is (3,3).

4. **Pathfinding Strategy**: Utilize Breadth-First Search (good for shortest path) or DFS to trace a path from (0,0) to (3,3). Given the graph:

   - Start at (0,0)
   - Move to (0,1) following the connection.
   - Proceed to (0,2).
   - From (0,2) there are connections to (0,1) (which is backward) and (0,3).
   - Continue to (0,3).
   - From (0,3) you can connect to (0,2) (backward) or try a different path if possible.
   - Assume no direct route to target; backtrack and explore another vector from past nodes.
   - At node (0,2), take branch to (1,2).
   - From (1,2), move to (1,3).
   - From (1,3) traverse to (2,3).
   - From (2,3), a straight path to (3,3) is possible.

   Notably, there are many ways through the maze generally, but careful tracking shows a path that is accessible based on the connections given in the adjacency list.

5. **Path Formatting**: Once determined, the path needs to be written in the format requested with the path start and end tokens.

Based on the provided adjacency list and following through the connections, the output should be:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This path proceeds logically through the maze as uncovered by the adjacency list, ensuring the use of BFS or DFS to explore possible paths. Ensure no circular routes and that the final path is generated without exceeding the maze's boundaries or breaking its navigation rules.
