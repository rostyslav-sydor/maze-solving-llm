To solve the maze, we'll first parse the adjacency list to understand the graph representing the maze. The adjacency list describes which points (nodes) are connected by paths (edges). We can use this information to create a map of the maze and then search for a path from the origin to the target using an appropriate pathfinding algorithm.

The adjacency list provided is:

```
(2,3) <--> (3,3)
(2,1) <--> (1,1)
(0,1) <--> (0,0)
(3,1) <--> (2,1)
(3,3) <--> (3,2)
(0,1) <--> (0,2)
(0,0) <--> (1,0)
(2,0) <--> (1,0)
(1,3) <--> (2,3)
(3,1) <--> (3,2)
(2,2) <--> (1,2)
(3,0) <--> (3,1)
(1,3) <--> (0,3)
(0,2) <--> (1,2)
(2,0) <--> (3,0)
```

The origin (starting point) is `(0,0)` and the target (exit point) is `(3,3)`.

### Constructing the Pathfinding Solution:

1. **Graph Construction:**
   Convert the adjacency list into a data structure. An effective choice is a dictionary where each node points to its connected nodes.

2. **Selecting the Pathfinding Algorithm:**
   Implement a search algorithm. The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is suitable for an unweighted grid like this as it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

3. **Executing the Algorithm:**
   Start at the origin node `(0,0)` and explore each node by moving to its connected nodes until the target `(3,3)` is reached. Keep track of the path traversed using a queue and by marking visited nodes.

4. **Building the Result:**
   Once the target is reached, backtrack from the target node to the origin, constructing the path by following the breadcrumbs of visited nodes.

### Output:
Assuming BFS was correctly implemented and executed, and the shortest path was found using the given adjacency list, a plausible path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` might look like:

```
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
```

This path is a direct route from the origin to the target navigating through open connections as given in the adjacency list.

### Formatting the Final Output:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

This sequence follows directly from the origin to the target by navigating through allowed paths, providing a valid solution to the maze based on the adjacency list.
