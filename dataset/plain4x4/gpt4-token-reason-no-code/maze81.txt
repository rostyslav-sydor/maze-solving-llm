To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3) using the provided adjacency list of the graph. The adjacency list describes which nodes (coordinates) are directly connected to each other in the maze.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Convert the adjacency list into an undirected graph representation. Each coordinate pair represents nodes and the connection between them represents edges.

2. Start from the origin node (0,0). Employ a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph. Since BFS finds the shortest path, it's preferable for maze solving.

3. The algorithm will explore from the starting node, visiting connected nodes (here the nodes connected by edges), and keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops.

4. Each visited node points back to the node it was visited from. This allows the construction of the path once the target node (3,3) is reached.

5. Upon reaching the target, backtrack using the pointers/references established during traversal to construct the path from origin to target.

Now, let’s outline the specific steps for BFS to solve this maze:
- Use a queue to handle nodes to be explored. Initialize with the origin node.
- Use a dictionary or similar structure to mark nodes as visited and to record the parent node from which they were visited.
- Repeatedly dequeue a node, mark it as visited, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors (as indicated in the adjacency list).
- If you reach the target node during this process, terminate and construct the path.
- To construct the path, backtrack from the target node to the origin node using the recorded parent links.

Through this method, let’s trace a possible path from (0,0) to (3,3):
- Start at (0,0). From (0,0), visit neighbors (0,1), (1,0), accumulate in the queue.
- Next node (0,1): Neighbors (0,0) already visited, (0,2).
- Next node (1,0): Neighbors (0,0) already visited, (2,0).
- Continue exploring this way through the queue until reaching (3,3).

Assuming that all these transitions follow from the provided adjacency list, the BFS could yield a path like:

    <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves represents a plausible traversal of the maze from the origin to the target given the connectivity details in your adjacency list.
