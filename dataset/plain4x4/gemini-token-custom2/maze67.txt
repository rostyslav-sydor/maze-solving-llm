Following a breadth-first search approach and implementing it on the maze, visiting and queuing neighbors of current node, we reach the target node at (3,3) by the following steps:
1) Move right from (0,0) to (1,0)
2) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0)
3) Move right from (2,0) to (3,0)
4) Move down from (3,0) to (3,1)
5) Move down from (3,1) to (3,2)
6) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)
Now that we are at (3,3) and have successfully reached our target, we can backtrack and retrace our path to the starting point, marking the shortest path to reach (3,3):
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
