Using the same strategy as the previous maze, we start at the origin (0,0) and move in the direction specified by the adjacency list, marking visited nodes and backtracking the path to the target node at (3,3).

1) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0)
2) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0)
3) Move down from (2,0) to (3,0)
4) Move right from (3,0) to (3,1)
5) Move up from (3,1) to (2,1)
6) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2)
7) Move down from (2,2) to (3,2)
8) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)

Hence, the shortest path in this maze, following the graph structure and node connections provided, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
