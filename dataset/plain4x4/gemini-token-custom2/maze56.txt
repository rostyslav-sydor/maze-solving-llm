BFS Algorithm:
1) Initialize a queue data structure to perform BFS.
2) Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.
3) While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first node.
4) Check if the dequeued node is the target node. If so, we have reached the destination.
5) Iterate over all unvisited neighbors of the current node and enqueue them.
6) Mark the neighbors visited.
7) Store the predecessor of each visited node to trace the path later.
8) Repeat step 3-7 until either the queue is empty or we have found the target node.

By following the provided adjacency list, starting at (0,0), and implementing BFS with the steps described above, we can determine the shortest path as below:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>
