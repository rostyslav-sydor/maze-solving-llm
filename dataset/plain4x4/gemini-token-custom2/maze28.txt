Following the given adjacency list and applying BFS, we explore and queue each neighbor of the current node until we reach the target node at (3,3).
1) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0)
2) Move right from (1,0) to (1,1)
3) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1)
4) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2)
5) Move right from (2,2) to (3,2)
6) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)

Backtracking from the end point (3,3) by following predecessors, the calculated shortest path in your maze, considering the graph structure and node connections provided, is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
