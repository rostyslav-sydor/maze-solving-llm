Following the given adjacency list and applying BFS, we can find the shortest path in the maze by examining and queuing each neighbor of the current node until we reach the target node at (3,3):

1) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0)
2) Move down from (1,0) to (2,0)
3) Move down from (2,0) to (3,0)
4) Move right from (3,0) to (3,1)
5) Move up from (3,1) to (2,1)
6) Move right from (2,1) to (2,2)
7) Move down from (2,2) to (3,2)
8) Move right from (3,2) to (3,3)

Backtracking from the end point (3,3) by following predecessors, the calculated shortest path in your maze, considering the graph structure and node connections provided, is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
