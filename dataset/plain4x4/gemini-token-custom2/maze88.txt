1) Move down from (0,0) to (1,0)
2) Move right from (1,0) to (1,1)
3) Move down from (1,1) to (2,1)
4) Move down from (2,1) to (3,1)
5) Move right from (3,1) to (3,2)
6) Move down from (3,2) to (3,3)

Upon backtracking from the end point (3,3) by following predecessors, the calculated shortest path in your maze, considering the graph structure and node connections provided, is as follows:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
