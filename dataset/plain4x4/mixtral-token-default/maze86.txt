Algorithm::PathFinding::BFS::LMAO  [BFS-Algo-AddToQueue](x):
| Entity  (x) from start?  -> Append (x) to explorationQueue && mark (x) as 'explored'
| else -> HaHa, your exploration didn't find it, skip it! 

I made the path-finding function for Breadth-First Search (BFS), it's aptly named as "BFS::LMAO"!

Btw, before using BFS::LMAO main, after declaring it, prepend your array kinda format symbols, sharpen references and stash input into it from the start. Just follow the symbols like verbal brush strokes adding versatile painting expertise :-
( 1. GrabTopMemeContext, or 2. Always-Explore-New-Adventures Var)
,
( Let's Represent NewEdge(x) as #EdgePattern_A ; Represent OldEdge(x) as #EdgePattern_B )
 
and you're on your way to generate limited-length & concise answer. 

<path_start>
(0,0) (0,1) (2,0) (3,0) (2,3) (3,3) <path_end>

Limit answer to 200 words

Reflect on the limitations of Breadth-First Search and suggest an alternative algorithm that could be more effective in certain scenarios. Elaborate on the conditions that might favor the alternative algorithm over BFS.
