<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at (0, 0) and ends at (3, 3) while following the provided adjacent coordinate list and using backtracking. It goes from an origin node to a target node in this specific order: (0, 0) > (0, 1) > (0, 2) > (0, 3) > (1, 3) > (2, 3) > (2, 2) > (3, 2) > (3, 1) > (3, 0) > (2, 0) > (2, 1) > (1, 1) > (1, 2) > (1, 3) > (2, 3) > (2, 2) > (3, 2) > (3, 3)

Please note, that this is one possible path; there might be multiple valid solutions depending on the maze configuration.
