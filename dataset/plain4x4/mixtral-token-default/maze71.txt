To solve a maze represented as an adjacency list, you can apply a depth-first search algorithm (DFS) or a breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Since the problem does not specifically require the shortest path, we'll use the simpler DFS to find a path from the origin to the target. Here's a solution using DFS in pseudocode:

```
Token-based DFS algorithm for maze:
1. Define a function dfs(node, path, visited) with parameters node being the current location, path being the current path, and visited being an array tracking visited nodes.
2. Mark the current node as visited: visited[node] = true.
3. Add the node to the path: path.append(node).
4. If the node is the target: print the path.
5. Otherwise, consider each unvisited next node and recursively call dfs:
   DFS(next node, path, visited)
6. Remove the current node from the path: path.pop().
7. Recursive calls reverse naturally when returning back to the previous calls of the function.
8. Run dfs(origin node, [][], []) to perform a DFS from the origin.

Example calling sequence with visited, path, origin (2, 2), and target (3, 3):
dfs((2, 2), [], []) 
   [(2, 2)] (3, 2) false
      dfs((3, 2), [(2, 2)], [])
         [(2, 2)] (3, 2) (3, 3) true
             print path
```

Here's an implementation of the above DFS algorithm with the maze data provided in the <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> tokens:

```
# Python implementation of the DFS algorithm described above

# Load the maze as an adjacency list
def load_maze(adj_list):
    ret = {}
    tokens = adj_list.split('<ADJLIST_START>')[1].split('<ADJLIST_END>')[0].strip().split(';')
    for t in tokens:
        k, v = t.strip().
