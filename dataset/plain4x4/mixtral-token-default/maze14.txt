To solve the maze, I will use a depth-first search algorithm.

Backtracking Algorithm:
1. Set the current position to the origin point (0, 0).
2. Set the current position as visited.
3. If the current position is the target point (3, 3), stop and return the solution.
4. Otherwise, find all unvisited neighboring positions of the current position.
5. For each neighboring position:
   a. Set it as the new current position, and go back to step 2.
   b. If this position doesn't lead to the target point, backtrack to the previous position and try the next neighboring position.

Using this algorithm, we get the following path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1
