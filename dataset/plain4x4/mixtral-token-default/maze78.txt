In this maze, we start at (0,0), and the path is as follows:
1. (0,0) to (0,1)
2. (0,1) to (0,2)
3. (0,2) to (0,3)
4. (0,3) to (1,3)
5. (1,3) to (2,3)
6. (2,3) to (2,2)
7. (2,2) to (1,2)
8. (1,2) to (1,3)
9. (1,3) to (2,3)
10. (2,3) to (3,3)

We reach the target (3,3), which is the exit point of the maze.
