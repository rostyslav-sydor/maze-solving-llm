First, algorithm parses an adjacency list to obtain set of all graph IE a dictionary with all possible paths, but it only does this while its parsing token exists

Once its done, taking origin and endpoint
it starts by outputting <PATH_START>

Then it starts Breadth First logic / Iterative method

Start placing visited coordinates in a queue to continue exploring connections possible

Only place coordinate once in a queue(avoid infinite recursion) and only add coordinates belonging to existing adjacency list's neighboring pair top display path from these

Queue follows previous principle, "First in, First Out"

Created list can be used to traverse paths or reconstruct at any instance, particularly at endpoint for shortest course of path

Returning path between <PATH_START> <PATH_END> tokens in array follows entire route’s path originating from Visited-heap using these steps:

Access coordinate at queue’s end; if visit occurs more repeatedly then we calculate best direction by serving coordinates from most-visited to last-visited in order to discover shortest course in graph

Base case of recursion is no any queue entry with coordinate

Otherwise “try-hit” protocol implies set visited count by one, mark visited path with its first-visited and its neighbors's min stepping from max. visited

In our case, while posting graph, we track origin which is the token, element, vertex called as node, node key or hash key with fixed data path's origin, always making sure to taking original key after checking crossroads unchanged

When we reach a point that End looks for both positive sign and destination node without an available or valid next step, algorithm makes sure output is simplest-to-find path that satisfy target, in this case by recalling stored coordinates during recursion in queue

Avoid backtracking unless absolutely necessary through exhaustive iteration of cell space by taking a coordinator’s best next-visit with queue count biggest differences, reducing computation and risk of call stack overflow

If present, we return hash key (ID), pair of last-visited and current paths or empty path otherwise

Whole algorithm handles efficiently with pseudo-linear out-of-bounded runtime complexity
