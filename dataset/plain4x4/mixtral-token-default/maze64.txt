To find a solution for the given maze using only Djkstra's algorithm, we can modify the traditional implementation slightly, considering each connected node as a separate "level". Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Represent the maze as a graph-like structure, where each coordinate represents a node, and connected nodes have edges between them. For example, two coordinates having the same row or column are considered connected nodes.

2. Set the start node as the origin (0,0) and set its distance to 0.

3. Initialize an empty priority queue (to use Dijkstra's algorithm effectively). Add the start node to the priority queue and set its state as unvisited.

4. Begin the main loop:

While the priority queue is not empty:
	1. Extract the node with the minimum distance (U) from the priority queue.
    2. If the extracted node (U) is equal to the target node (3,3), then we have found a path, and we can report the solution and break the main loop.
    3. Otherwise, mark node U as visited and perform relaxation operations (checking neighboring nodes of the extracted node U). For each adjacent node V of U, check if the distance of V from the origin is smaller than the minimum distance of V, if so:
        1. Update the minimum distance of V, and add V to the priority queue if not already in it.
        2. Store the parent of V as node U.

5. When we have found the shortest path to the target node, start from that node and backtrace through the parent nodes until we reach the origin. Store the coordinates corresponding to the path in a list.

6. Finally, print the path found in the specified format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Thus, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from the origin to the target in a grid-like maze setting.

Found path: <PATH_START> (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) <PATH_END>

It's important to note that in the text-only interface, the output nodes can't be formatted in the
