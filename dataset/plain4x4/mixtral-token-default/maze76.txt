To find the path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3), we can apply a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on the graph. Let's use DFS for this example:

1. Start from the origin (0,0) and push it in the stack.
2. Pop the top node from the stack.
3. Check if the popped node is the target (3,3). If yes, end the algorithm.
4. If not, push all unvisited neighbors of the popped node to the stack.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the stack is empty or the target is found.

Applying DFS on the given maze:

<PATH_START>
1. Start from (0,0) and push it in the stack. Stack: [(0,0)]
2. Pop (0,0) and push its unvisited neighbor (1,0) to the stack. Stack: [(1,0)]
3. Pop (1,0) and push its unvisited neighbor (2,0) to the stack. Stack: [(2,0)]
4. Pop (2,0) and push its unvisited neighbor (1,0) to the stack. Stack: [(1,0)]
5. Pop (1,0) and push its unvisited neighbor (1,1) to the stack. Stack: [(1,1)]
6. Pop (1,1) and push its unvisited neighbor (2,1) to the stack. Stack: [(2,1)]
7. Pop (2,1) and push its unvisited neighbor (2,2) to the stack. Stack: [(2,2)]
8. Pop (2,2) and push its unvisited neighbor (3,2) to the stack. Stack: [(3,2)]
9. Pop (3,2) and push its unvisited neighbor (3,1) to the stack. Stack: [(3,1)]
10. Pop (3,1) and push its unvisited neighbor (3,0) to the stack. Stack: [(3,0)]
11. Pop (3,0) and push
