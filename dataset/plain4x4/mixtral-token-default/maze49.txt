 To find a solution for this maze, we'll implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the maze:

1. Parse the maze description from the text, split into adjacency list items using the newline character ('\n') as the separator.
2. Extract the starting position (origin) and the target position from the text using the corresponding tokens `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<TARGET_START>`.
3. Create a 'Queue' to help implement the BFS and a 'visited' array to keep track of visited coordinates.
4. Enqueue the starting position into the 'Queue', and mark the starting position as visited ('true') in the 'visited' array.
5. Repeat until the 'Queue' is empty or the target position is found:
   a. Dequeue the first item from the 'Queue'.
   b. Check if it is the target position; if so, output the solution in the format between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens, omitting the duplicate parenthesis in each step, and exit the algorithm.
   c. Otherwise, retrieve the adjacency list for the current coordinate position.
   d. Explore the adjacency list and enqueue all the valid neighboring positions (indicated by '->') into the 'Queue' one by one, checking if they are not visited ('false') in the 'visited' array. For each one, mark it as visited ('true') in the 'visited' array.

Below is the code applying the algorithm described above:

```python
def parse_adjacency_list(maze_desc):
    adj_list = {}
    for item in maze_desc.split(";"):
        # separate connected nodes with ':' and rest with ','
        a, b = item.split(":")
        adj_list[a] = adj_list.get(a, "") + b + " "
    return adj_list

def find_maze_path(maze):
    # Parse the maze description and extract adjacency list, origin and target coordinates
    adj_list = parse_adjacency_list(
