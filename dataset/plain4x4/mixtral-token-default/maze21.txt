We can utilize a graph search algorithm like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to find a solution path in the maze. Here, I'll use BFS:

1. Create an empty queue for visited nodes and initialize a 2D grid based on the adjacent list.
2. Set the starting point's (origin) value to 1.
3. Add the starting point to the queue, and while there are elements in the queue, do:
   a. Dequeue the current node and check its neighboring nodes.
   b. If a neighbor exists (connected according to given adjacency list) and hasn't been visited (value not 1), set that neighbor's value to (1 + total steps taken to reach this point).
   c. Enqueue the unexplored neighbor node to the queue.
4. Once there are no more elements left in the queue or the target node is found, stop.
5. Track the total number of steps taken from the starting point to each point in the graph through their values. 

The initial value of each square should be 0, except for the starting point (value of 1).

Now let's print the solution:

1. Start from the target point.
2. Iterate from that point backward toward the origin to print out the steps taken in reverse order:

<PATH_START>

 (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0)

<PATH_END>

In this example path, the agent moves from (0,0) to (3,3), crossing every square of the specified maze at least once. This path represents a solution for the given maze.
