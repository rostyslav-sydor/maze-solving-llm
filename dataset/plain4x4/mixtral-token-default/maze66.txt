The solution for the given maze is:
<PATH_START>
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(1, 2)
(2, 2)
(3, 2)
(3, 3)
<PATH_END>

The explanation for the solution path is as follows:

1. Start from the initial position (0, 0).
2. Follow the edge (0, 0) <--> (0, 1).
3. Continue following the edge (0, 1) <--> (0, 2).
4. Take the edge (0, 2) <--> (1, 2) to get to adjacent square (1, 2).
5. Take the edge (1, 2) <--> (2, 2) to reach square (2, 2).
6. Follow the edge (2, 2) <--> (3, 2) to arrive at square (3, 2).
7. Finally, follow the edge (3, 2) <--> (3, 3) and reach the target position (3, 3). 

Thus, the list of coordinates encountered by the solver when moving from the origin to the target endpoint is found after a detailed analysis of the maze problem data and taking care of edge cases carefully.

Steps taken are 7 in total and solution string is given using delimiter tokens <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> for clarity as requested by the user.
