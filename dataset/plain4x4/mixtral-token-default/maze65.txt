In this maze represented by an adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3). Here is the solution:

1. From (0, 0), we can go to (0, 1) or (1, 0). Let's initially choose (1, 0)
2. From (1, 0), we can go to (1, 1) or (2, 0). Let's go to (2, 0)
3. From (2, 0), we can only go to (2, 1)
4. From (2, 1), we can go to (1, 1) or (3, 1). Let's choose (3, 1)
5. From (3, 1), we can only go to (3, 2)
6. From (3, 2), we can go to (2, 2) or (3, 3). Let's choose (3, 3)

We have now reached the target (3, 3). The path we travelled is:

(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)

The path represented as coordinate list between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

This is a possible solution for the given maze. There might be other solutions, depending on the initial choice of direction at each intersection.
