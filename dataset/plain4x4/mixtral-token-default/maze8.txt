 To find a solution for this maze, we need to apply a pathfinding algorithm such as the Depth-First Search (DFS) or the Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, we will use the DFS algorithm, as it is simple and efficient for solving mazes like this.

1. Mark the starting point on the maze, i.e., (0,0), as "visited."
2. Add the starting point to the stack.
3. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
   a. Pop the top node from the stack.
   b. If the current node is a terminal node (i.e., (3,3)), return the traversal path.
   c. Traverse all the unvisited neighbors of the current node and mark them as "visited." Add each one of them to the stack one by one.

Let's apply the algorithm step by step:

1. Mark (0,0) as "visited," add it to the stack: (0,0).
2. Pop (0,0) from the stack. Its neighbors are (1,0) and (0,1), but we will start with (1,0). Mark (1,0) as visited and add it to the stack: (0,1), (1,0).
3. Pop (1,0) from the stack. Its neighbors (1,1) and (2,0) are unvisited. Mark (1,1) as visited, and add it to the stack: (0,1), (1,1), (2,0).
4. Keep doing the same process until we reach (3,3). The final stack will look like this: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0). (0,1)

Now that we have built the traversal path, let's reverse it to get the solution in the format requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
