Firstly, it's important to emphasize that the given adjacency graph uses each of its neighbors' coordinates separated by commas in brackets, with letters pointing to the coordinates of a cell grid, like shown below:

               (0,0)    (0,1)    (0,2)    (0,3)
   (1,0)            (1,1)          (1,2)                   (1,3)
               (2,0)    (2,1)    (2,2)    (2,3)
   (3,0)            (3,1)          (3,2)                   (3,3)

In order to find the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3), we can use different algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), among others. In this case, we'll use a modified version of a DFS algorithm known as min-conflict heuristic. The modified DFS algorithm "jumps" to unvisited cells that have the shortest distance (Euclidean distance in this case) from the target. To clarify:

1. Start at the origin point
2. Initially add (0,0) to the queue to represent a 'current' and 'visited' position
3. Add (0,1) and positions adjacent to (0,0) to the queue (only considering positions where a next step can be placed - walls won't be considered)
4. Calculate the Euclidean distance for each of the positions, as presented below:

Distance(target point coordinate [x,y], visited point coordinate [u,v])=sqrt((x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2 )

5. Identify the first visited position with the minimum distance to determine where to move into next
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the target is reached

Here is the solution for the maze:

<PATH_START>
(0,0)
(1,0)
(1,2)
(2,2)
(3,2)
(3,3)
<PATH_END>
