 To direct the AI in finding a solution to the provided maze, please follow these step-by-step instructions and use plain English language.

1. Identify the start and target points in the maze: Start at node (0,0), indicated by <ORIGIN_START> and <ORIGIN_END> tokens. The goal is to reach node (3,3), marked by <TARGET_START> and <TARGET_END> tokens.

2. Explore the adjacency list: Look for nodes connected to the start node. The connected nodes for (0,0) are (1,0), (0,1), and (0,2), based on the following edges: (0,0) <--> (1,0), (0,1) <--> (0,2).

3. Select a new node: Choose one of the connected nodes as the next step in the path. In this case, let's choose (1,0) as it is in the direction of the target (3,3).

4. Add the selected node to the path: The path now consists of one node, (0,0) -> (1,0). Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.

5. Repeat exploration from the new node: Look for nodes connected to (1,0). The connected nodes for (1,0) are (1,1) and (0,0), based on the following edges: (1,0) <--> (0,0), (1,0) <--> (1,1). 

6. Avoid visited nodes: Since (0,0) has already been visited, it cannot be chosen as the next node. We will choose (1,1) instead.

7. Update the path: The path now consists of (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1).

8. Continue exploring: Continue the process of selecting a connected, unvisited node until you reach the target node (3,3) or run out of options.

9. Output the path: Once the target node (3,3) is reached, output the entire path in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, where the first coordinate is the row and the second coordinate is the column. For example:
