Here's a solution for this maze:

To represent it as a path coordinate list, let's follow the direction of the arrows. This maze only has single way solution.

1. Start at (0, 0): `(0,0)`
2. The only path from there is East to (0, 1): `(0,1)`
3. Then North is the only potential option, leading to (0,2): `(0,2)`
4. The path then leads East to (1,2): `(1,2)`
5. Then follows South to (1,1): `(1,1)`
6. Then East to (2,1): `(2,1)`
7. Then North to (2,2): `(2,2)`
8. Then East to (3,2): `(3,2)`
9. Then North to (3,3): `(3,3)`

Now let's represent the path coordinate list:

<PATH_START>
(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)
<PATH_END>

Here's a representation of the path on the maze:

000
110
200
300
