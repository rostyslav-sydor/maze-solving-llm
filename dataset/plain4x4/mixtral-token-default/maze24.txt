Step 1: From the origin (0, 0), go to (1, 0)
Step 2: From (1, 0), go to (2, 0)
Step 3: From (2, 0), go to (3, 0)
Step 4: From (3, 0), go to (3, 1)
Step 5: From (3, 1), go to (3, 2)
Step 6: From (3, 2), go to (3, 3)
Step 7: The target (3, 3) is reached.

The completed path is (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)
