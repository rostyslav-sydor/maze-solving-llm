<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>

(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1) is the path to traverse from (0, 0) to (2, 1). 
(2, 1), (2, 2) is the path from (2, 1) to (2, 2).
(2, 2), (3, 2) is the path from (2, 2) to (3, 2).
(3, 2), (3, 3) is the path from (3, 2) to (3, 3).

Concatenating all the individual paths gives the overall path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (3, 3): <PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>.
