 To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin point at (0,0) to the target point at (3,3) by navigating through the adjacency list of tokens representing adjacent squares in the maze.

Here is the adjacency list for reference:
<ADJLIST_START>
 (1,3) <--> (1,2) ;
 (3,3) <--> (2,3) ;
 (2,0) <--> (3,0) ;
 (1,0) <--> (1,1) ;
 (0,2) <--> (0,1) ;
 (3,2) <--> (2,2) ;
 (0,2) <--> (1,2) ;
 (1,0) <--> (0,0) ;
 (0,1) <--> (0,0) ;
 (2,1) <--> (1,1) ;
 (1,3) <--> (2,3) ;
 (0,2) <--> (0,3) ;
 (3,3) <--> (3,2) ;
 (3,1) <--> (3,0) ;
 (3,1) <--> (2,1) ;
<ADJLIST_END>

Then, the path would be found following these steps:

1. Start at the origin point (0,0).
2. Check the adjacency list for an entry starting with our current position and find the first adjacent connected square, which is (0,1).
3. Update our current position to our new location (0,1).

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, each time looking for the next adjacent square connected to our current position, moving forward until we reach the target square at (3,3).

Here's the path traversed in reverse order (starting from the end):
<PATH_START>
 (3,3)
 (2,3)
 (1,3)
 (1,2)
 (1,1)
 (0,1)
 (0,0)
<PATH_END>

The path from the origin point to the target point in forward order, which can be found by reversing the list, is:
<PATH_START
