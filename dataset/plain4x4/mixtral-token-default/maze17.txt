To solve the maze, we need to perform a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, starting from the origin and stopping once we reached the target. To seamlessly generate the code, we'll assume we have a framework or library with an existing graph data structure and search/path finding algorithms in place. Below is the code for solving the maze:

```python
from maze_library import Graph, DepthFirstSearch  # Library with graph and DFS implementation

def solve_maze(maze, entry, target):
    g = Graph()

    # Parse maze adjacency list
    for line in maze:
        # Exclude non-edge tokens lines
        if line.startswith("<ADJLIST_START>") or line.startswith("<ADJLIST_END>") or line.startswith("<ORIGIN_START>") or line.startswith("<ORIGIN_END>") or line.startswith("<TARGET_START>") or line.startswith("<TARGET_END>"):
            continue

        tokens = line.split(";")
        for token in tokens:
            start, end = token.strip().replace("(", "").replace(")", "").split("<-->")
            g.add_edge(start.strip(), end.strip())

    search = DepthFirstSearch(g)

    # Graph is undirected, add reverse edges
    search.add_reverse_edges()

    solution = search.run(entry, target)
    if solution is None:
        return "<PATH_START> NONE <PATH_END>"

    return "<PATH_START>" + " (".join(map(str, solution)) + "<PATH_END>"

# Run the solver
print( solve_maze(maze, entry="(0,0)", target="(3,3)") )
```

This code uses an abstract graph library with a DFS implementation and navigation functionalities. However, no such library is explicitly used in this example, I've simply assumed there's one named 'maze_library' with a graph object and a DepthFirstSearch algorithm.

In parsing the maze data, edges are extracted and added to the graph
