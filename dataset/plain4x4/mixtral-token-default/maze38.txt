 To navigate the maze, we will employ a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here is the solution in pseudocode, which can be translated to any programming language of your preference for execution.

1. Start BFS with the origin, add its coordinates to the queue.
2. As long as the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the frontmost coordinate from the queue.
   b. Mark it as visited to prevent looping.
   c. If it is the target, end the BFS and initialise a backtrace vector with the current coordinates.
   d. For each unvisited coordinate adjacent to the current one, add its coordinates to the queue.
   e. Repeat steps d and e until the queue is empty, or we have reached the target coordinates.

Following the above steps, we now have a backtrace vector with visited coordinates.

3. Reverse the backtrace vector to get the solution in order from origin to target.
4. Transform the backtrace vector into a string in the desired format between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Now with this solution, let's write the Python code for the same:
```python
adjlist = [(3, 3), (3, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1)]

def is_valid(r, c, bfs_matrix):
    """
    Check if (r, c) is valid coordinate, considering adjacency list.
    """
    for adj_r, adj_c in adjlist:
        if r == adj_r and c == adj_c:
            return True
    return False
