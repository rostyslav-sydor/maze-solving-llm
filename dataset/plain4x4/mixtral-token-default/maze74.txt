 The provided maze and coordinate information demonstrates the structure of a rectangular grid. In order to solve the maze and determine the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3), we require an efficient search method or algorithm, such as A\* or Dijkstra's algorithm.

As only the unreachable nodes are given as adjacent lists for the tokens, an alternative method could be employed to model the problem as a graph with obstacles as the difference representation of a grid with impassable areas. Then, we may apply an appropriate pathfinding algorithm like A\* or Dijkstra's solution, which have small constant factors, as distributed pathfinding methods.

Therefore, a general solution to discover a path (list of coordinates) between given points on this maze would include:

- Modeling the adjacency graph and obstacle nodes as a weighted graph with disconnected tiles represented as impassable areas at that position. Obstacles would have path weights infinitely large or equal to the maximum safe path estimate, to ensure they are bypassed.

- Creating a new node class or data structure with appropriate fields to store the nodes' coordinates (x,y), neighbor list, and edge weights. Return a list of those resulting nodes.

- Running an appropriate pathfinding algorithm (A* or Dijkstra's) on this graph to compute the shortest path. The endpoints to be connected are (0,0) and (3,3).

- If a solution path exists, we can provide the coordinates of the path nodes, delimited within the tokens <PATH_START> and <PATH_END>. The path will be listed in sequence of arrival to each node from the origin, as required.

- Please note that due to potential variations in the particular formulation needed for your system, the determination of the path may involve adjustments (e.g. conversion from decimal to Cartesian coordinate systems, or using negative costs for obstacles or non-existant elements, etc.).

This is a general approach to solving the maze given the provided adjacency lists. The specific formulation and implementation of the solution outlined above would depend on the language and platform you are using, as well as any relevant edge cases or constraints.
