To find a solution for this maze, we will use the Wavefront algorithm. Since the graph is represented as an adjacency list, we will traverse the graph and store the distances from the origin point for each vertex. Then we will trace back from the target point to reconstruct the shortest path.

Here is the adjacency list of the graph:

1. (1,0) -> (1,1) 2. (2,0) -> (3,0) 3. (0,3) -> (1,3) 4. (0,1) -> (0,0) 5. (0,2) -> (0,1) 6. (3,3) -> (3,2) 7. (2,1) -> (1,1) 8. (1,0) -> (0,0) 9. (1,2) -> (2,2) 10. (1,3) -> (2,3) 11. (0,2) -> (0,3) 12. (3,2) -> (3,1) 13. (2,1) -> (3,1) 14. (3,1) -> (3,0) 15. (2,3) -> (2,2)

The origin is (0,0), and the target is (3,3).

Now, following the algorithm:

1. Start at the origin, (0,0).
2. Find all adjacent vertices to the current position, which are (1,0), (0,1), and (0,2).
3. Set their distances as 1, and insert them into the queue.
4. Dequeue a vertex from the queue, which is (1,0).
5. Find its adjacent vertices, which are (1,1) and (0,0). Since (0,0) has already been visited (it's our origin), we can ignore it.
6. Set their distances as 2 (the distance of (1,0) + 1), and insert (1,1) into the queue.
7. Dequeue a vertex from the queue, which is (0,1).
8. Find its adjacent vertices, which are (0,
