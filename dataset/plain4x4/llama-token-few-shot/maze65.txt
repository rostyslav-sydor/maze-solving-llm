Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has 8 nodes, and the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3) is:

(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3)

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the target, passing through the nodes in the order listed.
