Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) is:

(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3)

Please note that the path is represented as a list of coordinates, where each coordinate is a row and column pair. The starting point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3).
