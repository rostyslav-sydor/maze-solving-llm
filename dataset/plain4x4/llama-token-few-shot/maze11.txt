Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Please note that the solution is given in coordinate format, where the first coordinate is the row and the second coordinate is the column.

Also, I have provided the solution for all three mazes you have given. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
