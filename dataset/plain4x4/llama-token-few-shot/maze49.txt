Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The maze has 8 nodes, and the shortest path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3) is as follows:

1. (0,0)
2. (1,0)
3. (1,1)
4. (1,2)
5. (2,2)
6. (2,3)
7. (3,3)

The solution is a straight line from the origin to the target, passing through the nodes in the order listed above.
