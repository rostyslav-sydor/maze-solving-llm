Here are the solutions to the three mazes you provided:

Maze 1:

Solution: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Maze 2:

Solution: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Maze 3:

Solution: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In each case, the solution is a list of coordinates (row, column) that represents the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point. The starting point is marked with <ORIGIN_START>, and the ending point is marked with <TARGET_END>. The path is represented as a list of coordinates, with each coordinate representing the row and column of the next node in the path.
