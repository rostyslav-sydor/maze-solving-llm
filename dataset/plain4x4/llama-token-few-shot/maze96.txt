I understand you have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you need to find a solution for it. I'm here to help! Please provide the maze and the desired solution, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Please note that the solution you provide should be in the format of a coordinate list, where each coordinate is a row and column index. For example, if the solution is (3, 4), it means the path goes from row 3 to row 4.

So, what is the maze and the desired solution you'd like to find?
