Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) is:

(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
