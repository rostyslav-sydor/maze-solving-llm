I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, I will find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze.

Here is the path from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path has 5 steps.

Now, let's find the shortest path from the origin to each of the exit points, marked as <TARGET_START> and <TARGET_END>.

Here are the paths to each exit point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The paths have 5 steps.

I hope this helps you solve the maze! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
