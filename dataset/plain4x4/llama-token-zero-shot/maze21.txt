I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our path as we go, using the format you specified: (row, column).

Here's the first step:

(1,1)

We'll move from the origin point (0,0) to the first step (1,1).

What would you like to do next?
