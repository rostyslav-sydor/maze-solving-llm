I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, I will find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the path.

Here is the BFS algorithm:

1. Mark the origin (0,0) as visited.
2. Explore all unvisited neighbors of the origin.
3. Mark all explored neighbors as visited.
4. Repeat step 2 until all unvisited neighbors have been explored.
5. Return the path from the origin to the target.

Using this algorithm, I have found the shortest path from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

This path consists of three steps:

1. Move from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move from (1,1) to (1,2).
3. Move from (1,2) to (1,3).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to find a different solution.
