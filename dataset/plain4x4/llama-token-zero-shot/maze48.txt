I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I can help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll need to find a path from the origin to the target point. We can start by exploring the maze one step at a time, using the adjacency list to guide us.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: Move from (0,0) to (3,0)

The next step will depend on the available moves. Let me check the adjacency list...

Ah, I see that we can move from (3,0) to (3,1) or (3,2). Let's choose (3,2) for now.

Step 2: Move from (3,0) to (3,2)

Now we're at (3,2). Here's the updated path so far:

(0,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,2)

Let's keep going! The next step will be to move from (3,2) to either (2,3) or (3,3). Which one do you think is the best choice?
