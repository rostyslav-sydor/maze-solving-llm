I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that we want to move to.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (1,0)

Reasoning: We move one step to the right from the origin.

Now, our current position is (1,0).

Let's continue exploring the maze. What would you like to do next?
