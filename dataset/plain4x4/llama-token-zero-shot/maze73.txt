I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is marked as <ORIGIN_START>. The starting point is located at coordinate (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current coordinate based on the direction we move.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
We move from the starting point (0,0) to the neighboring cell (1,0) because there is a path from (0,0) to (1,0).

Current coordinate: (1,0)

Now, let's check the next step. We have two options:

Option 1: Move to (1,1) because there is a path from (1,0) to (1,1).

Option 2: Move to (1,2) because there is a path from (1,0) to (1,2).

Which option do you prefer?
