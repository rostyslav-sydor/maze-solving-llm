I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,0) (already visited)

The current position is (1,0). Let's check the adjacent cells that have not been visited before:

Step 2: (1,0) -> (1,1) (not visited)

We'll update the current position to (1,1). Now, let's check the adjacent cells that have not been visited before:

Step 3: (1,1) -> (1,2) (not visited)

We'll update the current position to (1,2). Now, let's check the adjacent cells that have not been visited before:

Step 4: (1,2) -> (2,2) (not visited)

We'll update the current position to (2,2). Now, let's check the adjacent cells that have not been visited before:

Step 5: (2,2) -> (2,3) (not visited)

We'll update the current position to (2,3). Now, let's check the adjacent cells that have not been visited before:

Step 6: (2,3) -> (3,3) (not visited)

We'll update the current position to (3,3). We have reached the target point!

Here's the complete path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is: (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)
