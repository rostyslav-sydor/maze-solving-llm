I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (3,0)

The current position is (0,0), and we move right to (3,0).

Here's the updated maze:

<ADJLIST_START> (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (1,0) <--> (2,0) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (2,3) <--> (1,3) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (1,0) <--> (0,0) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Now, let's continue exploring the maze. What would you like to do next?
