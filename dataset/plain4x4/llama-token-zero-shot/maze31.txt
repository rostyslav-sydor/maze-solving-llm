I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that we can reach from the current position.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (1,0)

The next position is (1,0), which is the first cell to the right of the origin.

Now, let's update the current position and continue to the next step.

Step 2:
Current position: (1,0)
Next position: (1,1)

The next position is (1,1), which is the first cell up and to the right of the current position.

Let's update the current position and continue to the next step.

And so on...

After exploring the maze step by step, we'll reach the exit point, which is the target (3,3).

Here's the complete path from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path is a list of coordinates, where each coordinate is a row and column position in the maze.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution.
