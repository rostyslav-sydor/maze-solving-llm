I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll create a list of all the possible paths from the origin point to the target point. We'll use the adjacency list to determine the possible moves from each point in the maze.

Here's the first path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3)

Is this the path you were looking for?
