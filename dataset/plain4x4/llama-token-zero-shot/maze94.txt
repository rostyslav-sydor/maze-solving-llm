I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is marked as <ORIGIN_START>. The starting point is (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our current position and the next position we'll move to.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (0,1)

Our current position is (0,0), and we move to (0,1).

Now, let's move to the next step:

Step 2: (0,1) -> (1,1)

Our current position is (0,1), and we move to (1,1).

Continuing on, we have:

Step 3: (1,1) -> (1,2)

Step 4: (1,2) -> (2,2)

Step 5: (2,2) -> (2,3)

Step 6: (2,3) -> (3,3)

We've reached the exit point of the maze, marked as <TARGET_END>. Our final position is (3,3).

Here's the complete path we've traced:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
