I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you want to find a solution, which I will provide in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To start, let's identify the entry point and exit point in the maze. Based on the adjacency list, we can see that there are two entry points: (0,1) and (2,0). The exit point is (3,3).

Next, we'll create a list of all possible paths from the entry points to the exit point. We'll start with the path from (0,1) to (3,3).

Here's the first path:

<PATH_START> (0,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

Now, let's explore other paths from the entry points. We'll find that there are three paths from (2,0) to (3,3):

1. (2,0) (2,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>
2. (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>
3. (2,0) (2,1) (2,3) (1,3) <PATH_END>

Finally, we'll combine all the paths we've found to create the complete solution for the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

The complete solution is:

(0,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (1,3)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution.
