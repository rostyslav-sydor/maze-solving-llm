I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll create a list of all the possible paths from the origin point to the target point. We'll use the adjacency list to determine the valid moves for each step.

Here's the first path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

This path takes us from the origin point to the target point in four steps.

Now, let's check if there are any other valid paths. After some analysis, we find that there is only one other valid path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path also takes us from the origin point to the target point in four steps.

Therefore, the solution to the maze is either:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

or:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Both paths take the same number of steps (four), and they both end at the target point (3,3).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything.
