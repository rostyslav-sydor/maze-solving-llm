I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I can help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, I'll identify the origin and target points in the maze:

<ORIGIN_START> (0,0)
<ORIGIN_END> (0,0)

<TARGET_START> (3,3)
<TARGET_END> (3,3)

Now, let's begin the search. I'll start at the origin point and explore the maze one step at a time.

Step 1:

From (0,0), I can move to (1,0) or (0,1). Let's choose (1,0).

<PATH_START> (1,0)

Step 2:

From (1,0), I can move to (1,1) or (1,3). Let's choose (1,1).

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1)

Step 3:

From (1,1), I can move to (1,2) or (1,3). Let's choose (1,2).

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1) (1,2)

Step 4:

From (1,2), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3). Let's choose (2,2).

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2)

Step 5:

From (2,2), I can move to (2,3) or (3,2). Let's choose (2,3).

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3)

Step 6:

From (2,3), I can move to (3,3) or (2,2). Let's choose (3,3).

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)

The final path is:

<PATH_START> (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)

<PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is: move from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) by following the path: (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3).
