Thank you for providing the maze representation as an adjacency list. I can help you find a solution to this maze.

To start, I will identify the origin and target points in the maze. Based on the <ORIGIN_START> and <TARGET_END> tokens, the origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3).

Next, I will find the shortest path from the origin to the target using Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm will give me the shortest distance between the origin and the target, which is the number of steps required to reach the target from the origin.

Here is the shortest path from the origin to the target:

(0,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)

The shortest distance between the origin and the target is 4 steps.

Now, I will output the solution in the format you requested, with the first coordinate being the row and the second coordinate being the column. Here is the solution:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.
