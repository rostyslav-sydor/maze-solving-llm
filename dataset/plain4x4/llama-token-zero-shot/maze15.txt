I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you want to find a solution, which I will provide in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To start, let's analyze the maze. We can see that there are two entry points, (0,0) and (1,1), and two exit points, (3,3) and (0,0). The maze has a total of 11 nodes, and there are no loops or repeated edges.

Now, let's find a solution. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the maze. We'll start at the first entry point, (1,1), and explore the maze one node at a time, following the edges according to the adjacency list.

Here's the solution, step by step:

1. (1,1)
2. (1,2)
3. (1,3)
4. (2,1)
5. (2,2)
6. (2,3)
7. (3,1)
8. (3,2)
9. (3,3)

The final solution is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
