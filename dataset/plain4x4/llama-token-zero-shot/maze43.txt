I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin. Based on the adjacency list, the origin is located at (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update our current position and keep track of the path we've taken.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:

Current position: (0,0)

We'll move east from the origin to reach the first node, which is located at (0,1).

New position: (0,1)

Now, let's move north from (0,1) to reach the next node at (1,1).

New position: (1,1)

We'll continue exploring the maze in this way, following the adjacency list and updating our current position at each step.

When we reach the exit point, we'll output the path we've taken in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Let's start exploring the maze!
