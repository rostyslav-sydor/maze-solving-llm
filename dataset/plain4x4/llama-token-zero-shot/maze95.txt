I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, using the adjacency list to guide us. We'll keep track of our path by listing the coordinates of each step, separated by spaces.

Here's the first step:

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)

Now it's your turn. Which direction do you want to move? You can choose one of the following options:

A) Move up
B) Move left
C) Move right
D) Move down

Please respond with the letter of your chosen direction.
