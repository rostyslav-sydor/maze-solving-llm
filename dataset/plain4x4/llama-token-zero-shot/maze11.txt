I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin. Based on the adjacency list, the origin is located at (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update our current position and keep track of the path we've taken.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:

Current position: (0,0)

We'll move east from the origin to reach the first node, which is located at (1,0).

New position: (1,0)

Let's update our path so far:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0)

Now, we'll explore the next node. Based on the adjacency list, we'll move north from (1,0) to reach the node located at (1,1).

New position: (1,1)

Here's the updated path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1)

We'll continue exploring the maze in this way, following the adjacency list and updating our path as we go.

Let's keep going until we reach the target point, which is located at (3,3).

Remember, I'll keep track of our path and update it as we go. When we reach the target point, I'll output the complete path in the format you requested.

Are you ready to continue?
