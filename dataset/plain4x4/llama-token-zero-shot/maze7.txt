I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you want to find a solution, which I will provide in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To start, let's analyze the maze. We have the following entries and exits:

* <ORIGIN_START> (0,0)
* <ORIGIN_END> (3,3)
* <TARGET_START> (3,3)
* <TARGET_END> (0,0)

We can see that the maze has a rectangular shape, with the origin and target located at the center of the top and bottom edges, respectively.

Now, let's start exploring the maze. We'll begin at the origin and follow the arrows to find the shortest path to the target.

Step 1:
We start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).

Step 2:
We move down to (1,1).

Step 3:
We move right to (2,1).

Step 4:
We move down to (2,2).

Step 5:
We move right to (3,2).

Step 6:
We move down to (3,3), which is the target!

Here is the solution in the format you requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
