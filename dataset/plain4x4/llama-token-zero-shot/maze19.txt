I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (3,1) (already visited: (0,0))

The current position is (3,1).

Please let me know when you're ready to take the next step.
