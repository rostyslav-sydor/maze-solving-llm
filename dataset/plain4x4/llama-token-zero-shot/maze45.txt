I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,0)

The current position is (0,0), and we move one step to the right to reach (1,0).

Now, let's update the current position and continue exploring the maze:

Step 2: (1,0) -> (1,1)

The current position is (1,0), and we move one step up to reach (1,1).

Step 3: (1,1) -> (1,2)

The current position is (1,1), and we move one step right to reach (1,2).

Step 4: (1,2) -> (2,2)

The current position is (1,2), and we move one step down to reach (2,2).

Step 5: (2,2) -> (2,3)

The current position is (2,2), and we move one step right to reach (2,3).

Step 6: (2,3) -> (3,3)

The current position is (2,3), and we move one step down to reach (3,3).

Step 7: (3,3) -> (3,2)

The current position is (3,3), and we move one step left to reach (3,2).

Step 8: (3,2) -> (2,2)

The current position is (3,2), and we move one step down to reach (2,2).

Step 9: (2,2) -> (1,2)

The current position is (2,2), and we move one step left to reach (1,2).

Step 10: (1,2) -> (0,2)

The current position is (1,2), and we move one step left to reach (0,2).

Step 11: (0,2) -> (0,1)

The current position is (0,2), and we move one step down to reach (0,1).

Step 12: (0,1) -> (0,0)

The current position is (0,1), and we move one step left to reach (0,0), which is the exit point.

Here's the path to the exit point:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (2,0) (1,0) (0,1) (0,0) <PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is:

Start at (0,0) and move right, then up, then right, then down, then left, then down, then left, and finally move left to reach the exit point at (0,0).
