I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you want to find a solution, which I will provide in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To start, let's analyze the maze. We can see that there are two entry points, <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and <ORIGIN_END> (3,3), and two exit points, <TARGET_START> (3,3) and <TARGET_END> (0,0).

The maze has a total of 10 nodes, and the shortest path between the entry points and exit points is 4 nodes.

Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the first entry point (0,0), moves up to (1,1), then right to (1,2), up to (2,2), right to (2,3), and finally down to the first exit point (0,0).

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
