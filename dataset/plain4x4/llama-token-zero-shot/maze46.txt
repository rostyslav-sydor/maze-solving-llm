I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. We'll use the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens to represent the path.

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2)

As we move from the origin point (0,0) to the first step (0,1), we encounter a north edge.

Now, let's take the next step:

<PATH_START> (0,1) (1,1) (1,2)

As we move from step (0,1) to step (1,1), we encounter a west edge.

Here's the next step:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

As we move from step (1,1) to step (1,2), we encounter a south edge.

Now, we've reached the target point (3,3)! Here's the complete path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
