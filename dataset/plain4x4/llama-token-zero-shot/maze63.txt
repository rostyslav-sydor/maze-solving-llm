I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you to find a solution for this maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we will explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. At each step, we will update the current position with the next position based on the list.

Here is the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (1,0)

The next position is (1,0), so we will update the current position to (1,0).

Now, let's continue the exploration:

Step 2:
Current position: (1,0)
Next position: (1,2)

The next position is (1,2), so we will update the current position to (1,2).

Step 3:
Current position: (1,2)
Next position: (1,3)

The next position is (1,3), so we will update the current position to (1,3).

And so on...

After exploring the entire maze, the final position is (3,0).

Here is the complete path from the origin to the maze exit:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

The solution for the maze is:

<ORIGIN_START> (0,0)
<ORIGIN_END>

<TARGET_START> (3,0)
<TARGET_END>
