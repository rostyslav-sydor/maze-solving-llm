I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that we want to move to.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (1,1)

Reasoning: We move from the origin (0,0) to the cell at position (1,1) because it is the only cell that we can move to from the origin.

Now, let's update the current position and move to the next step.

Step 2:
Current position: (1,1)
Next position: (1,2)

Reasoning: We move from (1,1) to (1,2) because it is the only cell that we can move to from (1,1).

We'll continue this process until we reach the target point (3,3).

Here's the complete path:

(0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3)

The solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any further.
