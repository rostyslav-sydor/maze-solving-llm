I understand. Let's start by analyzing the maze. It has an origin point (0,0) and a target point (3,3). The maze has a total of 9 tokens, including the origin and target points.

To find a solution, we can use a step-by-step approach. We'll start at the origin point and explore the maze one token at a time, following the adjacency list.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Starting from (0,0), we can move to (1,0) or (0,1). Let's choose (1,0).

Our current position is (1,0).
