I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze in a step-by-step manner, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of the path we take, using the format you specified (<PATH_START> (row, column) (row, column) ... <PATH_END>).

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,2)

We start at the origin (0,0) and move to the second position (0,2).
