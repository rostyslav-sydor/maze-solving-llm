I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll create a list of all the possible paths from the origin point to the target point. We'll use the adjacency list to determine the possible moves from each cell to its neighboring cells.

Here's the list of possible paths:

1. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (3,3)
2. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)
3. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,3)
4. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Now, let's evaluate each path to determine which one is the shortest path to the target point. We'll use the "breadth-first search" algorithm to do this.

The shortest path is:

1. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (3,3)

This path has a total of 4 moves.

Here's the solution to the maze in the format you requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
