I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the next position in the list.

Here's the first step:

(0,0) -> (0,1)

Current position: (0,1)

Now, let's check the next position in the list:

(0,1) -> (1,2)

Current position: (1,2)

We'll continue this process until we reach the target point (3,3).

Here's the complete path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0)

The solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
