I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll check if we've reached the target point (3,3). If we haven't, we'll move to the next unvisited neighboring cell.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (3,1)

Now we're at (3,1). Let's check if we've reached the target point. No, we haven't, so we'll move to the next unvisited neighboring cell:

Step 2: (3,1) -> (2,2)

Now we're at (2,2). Still not at the target point, so we'll move to the next unvisited neighboring cell:

Step 3: (2,2) -> (1,3)

Now we're at (1,3). We've reached the target point!

Here's the path we've taken to reach the target point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (3,1) (2,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is: start at the origin (0,0), follow the adjacency list, and you'll reach the target point (3,3) in three steps.
