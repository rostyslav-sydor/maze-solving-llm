I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our path as we go, using the format you specified.

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2)

As we move from the origin point to the first step, we encounter the first intersection. We'll choose the left path, which leads us to the next step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

Now we're at the second intersection. We'll choose the down path, which takes us to the next step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3)

We've reached the third intersection. We'll choose the right path, which leads us to the target point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

There we have it! The solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to explore the maze further.
