I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that we haven't visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,0)

Current position: (1,0)

Now, we'll check the adjacent cells that we haven't visited before. We have two options:

Option 1: (1,1)
Option 2: (1,2)

Which option do you prefer?
