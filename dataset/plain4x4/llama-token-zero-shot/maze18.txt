I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze in a step-by-step manner, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of the path we take, starting from the origin.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,0)

We move one step to the right from the origin, and we're now at (1,0).

Here's the updated path:

(0,0) -> (1,0)

Now, let's take the next step:

Step 2: (1,0) -> (1,2)

We move one step up from (1,0), and we're now at (1,2).

Here's the updated path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2)

Continuing on, we'll take the next step:

Step 3: (1,2) -> (1,3)

We move one step to the right from (1,2), and we're now at (1,3).

Here's the updated path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (1,3)

We'll keep following the adjacency list to find the shortest path to the target point (3,3).

Remember, I'll keep track of the path we take, and I'll let you know when we reach the target point.

Let's continue with the next step:

Step 4: (1,3) -> (2,3)

We move one step to the right from (1,3), and we're now at (2,3).

Here's the updated path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)

We're getting closer to the target point! Let's take the next step:

Step 5: (2,3) -> (3,3)

We move one step to the right from (2,3), and we're now at (3,3), which is the target point!

Here's the complete path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

I hope this helps you find the solution to your maze! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any steps further.
