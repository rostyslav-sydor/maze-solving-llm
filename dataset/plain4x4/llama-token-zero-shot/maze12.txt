I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,0)

The current position is (0,0), and we move one step to the right to reach (1,0).

Now, let's update the current position and continue exploring the maze:

Step 2: (1,0) -> (1,1)

The current position is (1,0), and we move one step up to reach (1,1).

Step 3: (1,1) -> (1,2)

The current position is (1,1), and we move one step right to reach (1,2).

Step 4: (1,2) -> (2,2)

The current position is (1,2), and we move one step down to reach (2,2).

Step 5: (2,2) -> (2,3)

The current position is (2,2), and we move one step right to reach (2,3).

Step 6: (2,3) -> (3,3)

The current position is (2,3), and we move one step down to reach (3,3).

We have reached the target point (3,3), which is the end of the maze!

Here's the complete path from the origin to the target point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The path consists of six steps, moving right, up, right, down, right, and down.
