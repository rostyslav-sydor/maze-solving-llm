I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that we can reach from the current position.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (1,1)

Reasoning: We can move from (0,0) to (1,1) because there is a path from (0,0) to (1,1) in the adjacency list.

Now, let's update the current position to (1,1).

Step 2:
Current position: (1,1)
Next position: (1,2)

Reasoning: We can move from (1,1) to (1,2) because there is a path from (1,1) to (1,2) in the adjacency list.

Now, let's update the current position to (1,2).

Continuing this process, we can find the shortest path from the origin to the target point (3,3) in the maze.

Here's the shortest path:

(0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)

The path starts at the origin (0,0), moves to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,3), and finally to the target point (3,3).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything.
