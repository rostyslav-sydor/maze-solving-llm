I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our path using the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

Here's the first step:

1. (0,0) <-- (1,0)

Our path so far is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0)

What would you like to do next?
