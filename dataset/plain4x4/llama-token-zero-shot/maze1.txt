I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. Based on the adjacency list, the origin point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll create a list of all possible paths from the origin point to the target point. We'll use the adjacency list to determine the next node to visit based on the current node.

Here's the first path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the origin point (0,0) and moves east to (1,0), then south to (1,1), then west to (1,2), and finally north to (1,3).

Let's continue to explore the maze and find additional paths. Do you have any specific strategy or direction you'd like to explore first?
