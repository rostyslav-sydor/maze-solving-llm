I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, starting from the origin point. We'll keep track of our path by listing the coordinates in the format you requested.

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2)

As we move from the origin point to the first step, we encounter a choice of two directions: left and up. We'll choose the left direction, so our next step is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

Now we have three options: left, up, and right. We'll choose the up direction, so our next step is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3)

We continue in this way, choosing the appropriate direction at each step, until we reach the target point.

Here's the complete path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the solution.
