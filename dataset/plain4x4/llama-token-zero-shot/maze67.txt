I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. We'll use the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens to output the solution.

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1)

Your turn! Which direction would you like to move?
