I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin. Based on the adjacency list, the origin is located at (0,0).

Next, we'll find the first step of the path. We can see that there is a token at (0,1) that points to (1,1). So, our first step is to move from (0,0) to (1,1).

Now, let's move to the next step. We can see that there is a token at (1,1) that points to (1,2). So, our second step is to move from (1,1) to (1,2).

Continuing in this way, we can find the rest of the path. Here is the complete path from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

The path has four steps. Let me summarize the path for you:

1. Move from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. Move from (1,1) to (1,2).
3. Move from (1,2) to (1,3).
4. Move from (1,3) to the target (3,3).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything.
