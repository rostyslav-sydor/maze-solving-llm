I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you would like to find a solution for it. I can certainly help you with that!

To start, let's identify the entry point and exit point of the maze. Based on the adjacency list, it seems that the entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).

Next, we'll need to explore the maze and find a path from the entry point to the exit point. We can do this by following the arrows in the adjacency list.

Here's the first step of the path:

(0,0) -> (1,1)

Now it's your turn! Can you take the next step and tell me the next coordinate of the path?
