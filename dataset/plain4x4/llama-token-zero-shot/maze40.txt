I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the adjacent cell that has not been visited before.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) -> (1,1)

The current position is (0,0), and we move to the adjacent cell (1,1) that has not been visited before.

Now, the current position is (1,1).

Let's continue exploring the maze step by step. At each step, I'll update the current position and let you know the new position.

Please let me know when you're ready to proceed.
