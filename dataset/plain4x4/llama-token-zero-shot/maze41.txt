I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Now, let's explore the maze step by step. At each step, I'll tell you the next coordinate you should move to.

Step 1: (0,0)

You start at the origin point (0,0). Your first move is to the right, so you move to coordinate (1,0).

Step 2: (1,0)

You are now at coordinate (1,0). Your next move is up, so you move to coordinate (1,1).

Step 3: (1,1)

You are now at coordinate (1,1). Your next move is right, so you move to coordinate (1,2).

Step 4: (1,2)

You are now at coordinate (1,2). Your next move is down, so you move to coordinate (1,3).

Step 5: (1,3)

You are now at coordinate (1,3). Your next move is left, so you move to coordinate (2,3).

Step 6: (2,3)

You are now at coordinate (2,3). Your next move is up, so you move to coordinate (2,2).

Step 7: (2,2)

You are now at coordinate (2,2). Your next move is left, so you move to coordinate (2,1).

Step 8: (2,1)

You are now at coordinate (2,1). Your next move is down, so you move to coordinate (2,0).

Step 9: (2,0)

You are now at coordinate (2,0). Your next move is left, so you move to coordinate (1,0).

Step 10: (1,0)

You are now at coordinate (1,0), which is the same as the origin point. Congratulations, you have found the solution to the maze!

Here is the path you took to reach the target point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
