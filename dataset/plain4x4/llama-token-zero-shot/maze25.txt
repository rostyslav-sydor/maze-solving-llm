I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current coordinate based on the direction we move.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:

Current coordinate: (0,0)

Move in the east direction (1,0) to reach the coordinate (1,0).

Now, we're at the coordinate (1,0).
