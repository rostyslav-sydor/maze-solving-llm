I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I will help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll update the current position with the next available position based on the list.

Here's the first step:

Step 1:
Current position: (0,0)
Next position: (0,1)

The next position is (0,1), so we'll update the current position and move on to the next step.

Let's continue this process until we reach the target point (3,3).

Here's the complete path to the target point:

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

The solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
