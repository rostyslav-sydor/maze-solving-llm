I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is <ORIGIN_START> (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our current position and the next position we'll move to.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) <--> (0,1)

Our current position is (0,0), and we'll move to (0,1).

Now, let's continue exploring the maze:

Step 2: (0,1) <--> (1,0)

Step 3: (1,0) <--> (1,1)

Step 4: (1,1) <--> (1,2)

Step 5: (1,2) <--> (2,1)

Step 6: (2,1) <--> (2,2)

Step 7: (2,2) <--> (3,1)

Step 8: (3,1) <--> (3,2)

Step 9: (3,2) <--> (3,3)

We've reached the exit point of the maze, which is <TARGET_END> (3,3).

Here's the complete path we've followed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any of the steps.
