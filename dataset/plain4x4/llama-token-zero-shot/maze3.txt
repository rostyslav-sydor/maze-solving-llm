I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you want to find a solution, which I will provide in the format of a coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.

To start, let's analyze the maze. We can see that there are two entry points, (0,0) and (2,0), and two exit points, (3,3) and (3,0). The maze has a total of 10 nodes, and there are no loops or repeated edges.

Now, let's begin our search for a solution. We'll start at the first entry point, (0,0). We can move left to (0,1), then up to (1,1), then right to (1,2), and finally down to (2,2). From there, we can move left to (2,1), then up to (3,1), and finally right to (3,2).

Here's the solution so far:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) <PATH_END>

Now, we'll continue our search from the point (3,2). We can move left to (3,1), then up to (3,3), and finally right to (2,3).

Here's the updated solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) <PATH_END>

And that's the complete solution for the maze! The path starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the target (3,3).

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
