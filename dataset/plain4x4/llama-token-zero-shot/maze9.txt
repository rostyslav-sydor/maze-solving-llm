I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, starting from the origin point. We'll keep track of our path by listing the coordinates of each step.

Here's the first step:

1. (0,0) <-- (1,0)

Our current position is (1,0).
