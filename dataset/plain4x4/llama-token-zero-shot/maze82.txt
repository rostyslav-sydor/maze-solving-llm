I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is the origin (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. At each step, we'll check if we've reached the target point (3,3). If we haven't, we'll move to the next unvisited neighbor.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) <-- (1,0)

We've moved one step to the right, and we're now at (1,0).

Let's continue exploring the maze. At each step, I'll update the list of coordinates to keep track of our progress.

Step 2: (1,0) <-- (1,1)

We've moved one step up, and we're now at (1,1).

Step 3: (1,1) <-- (1,2)

We've moved one step right, and we're now at (1,2).

Step 4: (1,2) <-- (2,2)

We've reached the target point (3,3)! Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

Assistant: 
There you have it! The solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
