I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you would like me to find a solution for it. I will work step by step to find the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3).

First, I will start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze.

Step 1: (0,0) -> (0,1)

The first step is to move east from the origin to reach (0,1).

Step 2: (0,1) -> (1,1)

From (0,1), I will move north to reach (1,1).

Step 3: (1,1) -> (1,2)

Next, I will move east to reach (1,2).

Step 4: (1,2) -> (2,2)

From (1,2), I will move south to reach (2,2).

Step 5: (2,2) -> (2,3)

Now, I will move west to reach (2,3).

Step 6: (2,3) -> (3,3)

Finally, I will move south to reach the target point (3,3).

The shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target point (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The solution is: move east, then north, then east, then south, then west, and finally south.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
