I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll explore the maze step by step, following the adjacency list. We'll use the coordinate list format you requested, with the first coordinate being the row and the second coordinate being the column.

Here's the first step:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2)

We start at the origin point (0,0) and move to the first available position, which is (1,1).
