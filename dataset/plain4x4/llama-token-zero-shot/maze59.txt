I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I'll help you find a solution to the maze.

First, let's identify the starting point of the maze, which is marked as <ORIGIN_START>. The starting point is located at coordinate (0,0).

Next, we'll explore the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list. We'll keep track of our current location and the next location we need to visit.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: (0,0) to (1,0)

Our current location is (0,0), and the next location we need to visit is (1,0).

Here's the updated list of locations we've visited so far:

[0,0]
[1,0]

Now, let's move on to the next step.

Step 2: (1,0) to (1,1)

Our current location is (1,0), and the next location we need to visit is (1,1).

Here's the updated list of locations we've visited so far:

[0,0]
[1,0]
[1,1]

Continuing in this way, we'll eventually reach the exit point, marked as <TARGET_END>.

Here's the complete path to the exit point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) <PATH_END>

The solution to the maze is:

Start at coordinate (0,0) and follow the path:

(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> <TARGET_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
