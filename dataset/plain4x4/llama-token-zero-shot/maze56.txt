I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, and you would like to find a solution for it. I can certainly help you with that!

To start, let's identify the entry point and exit point of the maze. Based on the adjacency list, it seems that the entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).

Next, we need to find a path from the entry point to the exit point. We can do this by following the arrows in the adjacency list.

Here's the path we can take:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path consists of 6 steps.

Now, let's output the path in the format you requested:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) <PATH_END>

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
