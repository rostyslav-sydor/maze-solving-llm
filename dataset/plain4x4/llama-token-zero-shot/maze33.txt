I understand. You have a maze represented as an adjacency list, with entry and exit points marked. I can help you find a solution to the maze.

To start, let's identify the origin and target points in the maze. The origin point is (0,0), and the target point is (3,3).

Next, we'll need to find a path from the origin to the target point. We can start by exploring the maze one step at a time, following the adjacency list.

Here's the first step:

Step 1: Move from (0,0) to (1,0)

The next step will depend on the available moves. Let's check the adjacency list for the next step:

(1,0) <--> (2,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (2,3) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,2) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (1,3) <--> (0,3) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (2,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (3,0) <--> (3,1)

Let's choose the move that leads to the target point:

Step 2: Move from (1,0) to (2,2)

Now we're closer to the target point! Here's the updated path:

(1,0) <--> (2,2)

Let's continue exploring the maze:

Step 3: Move from (2,2) to (2,3)

We're almost there! Here's the updated path:

(1,0) <--> (2,2) <--> (2,3)

And finally, we reach the target point:

Step 4: Move from (2,3) to (3,3)

The complete path from the origin to the target point is:

(1,0) <--> (2,2) <--> (2,3) <--> (3,3)

The solution to the maze is:

(1,0) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to help with anything else.
