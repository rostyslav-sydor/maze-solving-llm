One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution involves navigating from the starting point (S) at (1,1), moving down until reaching the second row, then making a series of turns to avoid hitting the walls and find the exit point (E) at (7,7).
