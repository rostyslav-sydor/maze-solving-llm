<Path_start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze, we can follow the path by moving down from (1,1) until reaching the end point at (7,7), avoiding the walls represented by hash signs. The solution path includes moving down, then following the path to the right, and finally moving up towards the exit point. By following this path, we can successfully navigate through the maze and reach the exit.
