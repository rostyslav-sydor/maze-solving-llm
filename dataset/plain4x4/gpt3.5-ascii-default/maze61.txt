The solution to the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (4,3) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path follows a sequence of moves from the starting point 'S' at (1,1) to the endpoint 'E' at (7,7), navigating through the maze while avoiding the walls represented by the hash signs. Each coordinate in the path represents a step in the correct direction towards the exit.
