To solve the maze, we can use the Depth First Search algorithm. Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we can explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point at (7,7).

One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (2,5) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path avoids the walls and successfully leads from the entry to the exit point. Each coordinate represents a step taken in the maze.

By following this path, we can navigate through the maze and reach the exit point successfully.
