The solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), the path moves down to (2,1), then continues down to (3,1) and (4,1) until reaching a dead end at (4,2). The path then backtracks to (4,1) and navigates through the maze by following a path that avoids the walls. Finally, the path reaches the exit point at (7,7).
