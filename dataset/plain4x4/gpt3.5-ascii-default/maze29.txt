<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

To navigate the maze, the path starts at point (1,1) and moves down to (2,1), then goes left to (3,1) and down again to (4,1). From there, it moves left to (5,1) and then snakes through the maze until reaching (7,7) which is the exit point. This path avoids all walls marked by hash symbols and successfully reaches the endpoint.
