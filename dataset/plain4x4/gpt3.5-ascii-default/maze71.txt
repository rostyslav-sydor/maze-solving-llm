The solution for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,2) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (5,6) (4,6) (3,6) (3,7) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <PATH_END> 

This path moves from the starting point S at (1,1) to the ending point E at (7,7), avoiding all the walls and reaching the exit successfully. The path follows a sequence of turns and straight lines to navigate through the maze and reach the destination.
