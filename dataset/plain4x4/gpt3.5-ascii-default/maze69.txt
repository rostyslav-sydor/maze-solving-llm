<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) <Path_End> 

This is one possible solution for navigating through the maze from the start point (S) to the end point (E). The solution involves moving down along the left wall, then following a series of turns to reach the exit without hitting any walls. The coordinates represent the position at each step in the path, with the format (row,column). The path avoids any dead ends or loops, leading directly from the start to the finish point.
