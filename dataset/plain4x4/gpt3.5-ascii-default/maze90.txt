<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

The solution to the maze involves navigating through the open pathways while avoiding the walls. Starting from the entry point at (1,1) and moving down, then turning right at (4,1) and following the path until reaching (4,4). From there, turning left and continuing through the maze until reaching the exit point at (7,7). This path avoids dead ends and leads directly to the end of the maze.
