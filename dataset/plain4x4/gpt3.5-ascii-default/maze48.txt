<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <Path_End> 

The solution path starts at (1,1) and proceeds down to (2,1) then right to (2,2) and (2,3). It continues to (3,3) and then follows a series of movements down until reaching (7,8), the exit point.
