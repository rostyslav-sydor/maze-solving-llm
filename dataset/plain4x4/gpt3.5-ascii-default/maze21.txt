<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <PATH_END> 

This is one possible solution for the given maze. The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and follows a series of turns and passages until it reaches the exit point at coordinate (7,7). The path avoids the walls marked with hash signs and navigates through the open spaces to reach the destination. This solution is represented as a list of coordinates within <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, with each coordinate indicating a point along the path taken through the maze.
