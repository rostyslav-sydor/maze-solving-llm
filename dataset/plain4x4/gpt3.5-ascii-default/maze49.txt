<Path_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze, we start at the entrance 'S' at coordinate (1,1) and move downwards until we reach a wall. Then we move to the right until we reach the bottom right corner. From there, we move upwards until we reach the exit 'E' at coordinate (7,7). This path avoids all the obstacles in the maze and leads us to the exit successfully. The solution is represented in the format of coordinate list between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
