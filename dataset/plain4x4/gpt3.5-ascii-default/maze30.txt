The solution for the maze involves following the path from the starting point 'S' to the ending point 'E' while avoiding the walls marked with hash signs. The path goes along the right side of the maze, then down, and finally left towards the exit. This solution ensures reaching the exit point (7,7) in the least number of steps.
