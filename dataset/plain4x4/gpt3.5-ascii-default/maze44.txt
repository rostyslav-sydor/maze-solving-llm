One possible solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1), follows along the left side of the maze, makes its way to the right side, and eventually reaches the exit point at (7,7). It avoids all walls and navigates through the open spaces of the maze to find the shortest path from the starting point to the end point.
