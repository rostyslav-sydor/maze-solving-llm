<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (6,5) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <Path_End> 

This solution involves moving down the first column until the fourth row, then moving right to the entrance of the maze, and then following a path that leads through the maze to the exit at (7,7). The solution avoids hitting any walls and reaches the exit point efficiently. Remember, in a real maze situation, the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens would not be present.
