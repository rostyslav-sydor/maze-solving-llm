<Path_start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <Path_end> 

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Start at (1,1) and move down to (2,1).
2. Turn right at (2,1) and move down to (3,1).
3. Turn right at (3,1) and move down to (4,1).
4. Turn right at (4,1) and move down to (5,1).
5. Turn right at (5,1) and move right to (5,2).
6. Continue moving right to (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5).
7. Turn down at (5,5) and move down to (6,5).
8. Turn right at (6,5) and move right to (7,5).
9. Continue moving right to (7,6) and finally reach the exit at (7,7).

This is the optimal path to reach the exit from the starting point.
