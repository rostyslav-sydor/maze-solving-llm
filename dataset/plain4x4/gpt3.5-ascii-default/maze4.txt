To solve this maze, we can use the depth-first search algorithm. By traversing the maze from the start point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7), we can find a path. 

One possible solution for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path moves downward until the obstacle is reached then moves right until the exit point is reached.

By following this path, the goal of reaching the exit point is achieved. This algorithm successfully navigates through the maze by exploring all possible paths until the exit is found.
