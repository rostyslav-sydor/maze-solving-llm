One possible solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the maze starting at the entry point (1,1), moving down to (2,1), then to (3,1) and continuing through until reaching the exit point (7,7). By following this path, the maze can be successfully solved.
