This path starts at the entry point (1,1) and navigates through the maze until reaching the exit point (7,7) by following a series of moves around the walls. Each coordinate represents a move from one space to an adjacent space in the maze. This solution successfully avoids hitting any walls and finds a clear path from the start to the finish.
