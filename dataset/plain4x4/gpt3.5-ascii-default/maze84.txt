The solution to the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This path goes from the starting point S at (1,1) to the exit point E at (7,7) while navigating through the maze and avoiding the walls marked with hash signs. By following this path, you can successfully navigate from the entry point to the exit point of the maze.
