One possible solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution path starts at the entry point (1,1) and navigates through the maze by following the open spaces while avoiding the walls. It reaches the exit point (7,7) without intersecting any walls, providing a clear path from start to finish. The path is represented by the list of coordinates enclosed within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, showing the row and column of each step taken.
