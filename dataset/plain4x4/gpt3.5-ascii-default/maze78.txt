In order to solve the maze, we can use the depth-first search algorithm. First, we will start from the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point (7,7). We will mark the visited paths and backtrack if we encounter a dead end.

After traversing through the maze, the solution path is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path successfully navigates through the maze from the starting point to the exit point, bypassing all walls.
