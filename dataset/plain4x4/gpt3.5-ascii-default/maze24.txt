The solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path moves from the starting point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7), avoiding the walls marked by hash signs. It navigates through the maze by moving down, then to the right, then up to reach the exit. The path goes around blocking walls and follows an efficient route to reach the end point.
