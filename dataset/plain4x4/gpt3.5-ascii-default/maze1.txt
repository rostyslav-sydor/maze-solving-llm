One possible solution for the maze would be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution involves moving from the starting point at (1,1) towards the exit point at (7,7) by navigating through the open spaces and avoiding the walls. By following this path, one can successfully reach the exit point.
