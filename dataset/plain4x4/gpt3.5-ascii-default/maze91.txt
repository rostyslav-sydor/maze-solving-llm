The solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1), then moves down to (2,1), then makes a right turn to (3,1) and progresses through multiple steps until reaching the exit point at (7,7). This path avoids the walls marked by hash signs and successfully navigates through the maze to reach the exit.
