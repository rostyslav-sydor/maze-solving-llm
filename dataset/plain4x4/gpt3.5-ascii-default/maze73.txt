The solution for the maze would be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), the path follows the open spaces until reaching the exit point at (7,7). The solution avoids the walls represented by hash signs and navigates through the maze to reach the end successfully. This path is the shortest and most optimal way to solve the maze.
