To find a solution for this maze, we can follow these steps:

1. Start at the entry point (1,1) and explore all possible paths while avoiding the walls.
2. Use a depth-first search algorithm to navigate through the maze.
3. Mark visited cells and backtrack when reaching dead ends.
4. Continue until reaching the exit point (7,7).
5. Record the path taken from entry to exit.

Applying the above steps to the given maze, a valid solution path could be:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This represents the coordinates of the path taken to successfully navigate from the entry point to the exit point through the maze, avoiding walls and dead ends along the way.
