This path navigates through the maze from the starting point to the exit point by following a series of connected coordinates that avoid the walls. The solution travels through open spaces, moving up and down the rows and columns until reaching the exit located at coordinate (7,7). The path avoids hitting any walls and successfully reaches the exit.
