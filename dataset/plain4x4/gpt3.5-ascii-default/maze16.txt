This solution goes from the starting point at (1,1) to the exit point at (7,7) by following a path that avoids the walls represented by hash signs in the maze. The path starts by moving down row by row until reaching the lower left corner, then follows a zigzag pattern to reach the exit. The solution is within the word limit of 200 words.
