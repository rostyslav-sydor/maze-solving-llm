To find a solution for the maze, we can use depth-first search algorithm. Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we explore all possible paths until we reach the exit point at (7,7).

One possible solution for this maze is:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

In this solution, we follow the path by moving down, then to the right, down again, and then right until we reach the exit.

By using the depth-first search algorithm, we can ensure that we find a valid path from the entry point to the exit point in the maze. The path may vary depending on the order in which nodes are visited, but a valid path will always be found.
