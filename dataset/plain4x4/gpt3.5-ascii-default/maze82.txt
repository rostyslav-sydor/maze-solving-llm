After analyzing the maze, a potential solution could be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1) and follows a clear route through the maze to reach the exit point at (7,7). By navigating around the walls and following the available pathways, the solution effectively leads from the start to the end point. The coordinates within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens represent the specific steps taken to traverse the maze successfully.
