To solve the maze, you would start at the entry point (1,1) and follow the path through the maze, making sure to avoid the walls (hash signs). The solution provided shows a possible path that leads to the exit point at coordinate (7,7). This path goes through various turns and twists, navigating through the open spaces in the maze. By following this path, you can successfully reach the exit point without hitting any walls. Remember to always stay on the open path and carefully navigate through the maze to reach the exit point.
