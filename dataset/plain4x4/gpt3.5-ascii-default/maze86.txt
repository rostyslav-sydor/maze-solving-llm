One possible solution to the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path moves from the starting point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7), navigating through the maze by going down, then left, up, right, and finally reaching the exit point.

By following this path, you can successfully navigate the maze and reach the exit point.
