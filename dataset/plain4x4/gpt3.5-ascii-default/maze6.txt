To solve the maze, you would start at the entry point S and follow a path that avoids the walls marked with hash signs. In this case, the path travels down and then turns to the right before eventually reaching the exit point E. The solution provided above lists the coordinates of each step along the path from the entry point to the exit point. Each set of coordinates represents a move either vertically or horizontally in the maze until reaching the desired destination. By following this path through the maze, you would successfully navigate from the entry point to the exit point.
