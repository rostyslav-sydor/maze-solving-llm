To find the solution to this maze, we can start at the entry point (S) at coordinate (1,1) and move towards the exit point (E) at coordinate (7,7). Following the available paths and avoiding the walls marked by hash signs, we can navigate through the maze by moving in the following directions: down, right, down, right, down, right, down, right, right, down, down, right. This path leads us from the entry point to the exit point, successfully solving the maze. The coordinates of the path taken are listed between the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
