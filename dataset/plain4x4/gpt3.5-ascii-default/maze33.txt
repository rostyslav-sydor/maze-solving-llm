One possible solution for the maze above could be:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (3,6) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution starts at the entry point (1,1) and navigates through the maze to reach the exit point (7,7) while avoiding the walls marked with hash signs. The path taken is shown within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
