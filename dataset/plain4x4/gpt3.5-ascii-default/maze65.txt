The solution to this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <PATH_END>

This path starts from the entrance at (1,1) and follows a series of left and down movements until reaching the exit at (7,7). This path avoids the walls of the maze and successfully navigates through to the end point.
