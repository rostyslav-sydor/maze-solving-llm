To solve this maze, we can follow the path indicated by the following coordinates:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (4,3) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Starting from (1,1) at the entry point marked as S, we navigate through the empty spaces avoiding the walls marked by # until we reach the exit point marked as E at (7,7).This path ensures we reach the exit point by moving through the available passages only, without crossing through any walls.

The provided coordinates outline the optimal path to take within the maze from the entry point to the exit point.
