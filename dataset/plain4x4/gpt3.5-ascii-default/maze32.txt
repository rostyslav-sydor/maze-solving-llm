To solve the maze, start at the entry point (1,1) and move downwards until reaching the bottom wall. Then, move right until hitting the right wall and move downwards again. Turn left at the bottom wall and continue moving left until reaching the exit point at (7,7). This path avoids the walls and leads directly to the exit.
