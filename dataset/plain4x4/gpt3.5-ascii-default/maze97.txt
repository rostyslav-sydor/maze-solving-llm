One possible solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at coordinate (1,1) and follows a route that avoids the walls to reach the exit at coordinate (7,7). The numbers in parentheses indicate the row and column of each coordinate in the path. The route follows a series of turns and straight paths through the open spaces in the maze. The path is enclosed by the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens to clearly designate the beginning and end of the solution.
