The solution for the given maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), we move down the first column until we reach the intersection at (3,1). Then we proceed towards the right along the top row until we reach (3,4). From there, we go down the fourth column to (6,4) and continue towards the exit at (7,7).

This path avoids the walls represented by hash signs and reaches the exit point efficiently.
