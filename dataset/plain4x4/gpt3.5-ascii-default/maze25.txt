The solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (4,5) (4,4) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1) and follows a route avoiding walls to reach the exit point at (7,7). The coordinates represent the row and column numbers of each step taken in the maze. The path is represented within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
