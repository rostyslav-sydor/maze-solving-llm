The solution for the maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path takes you from the starting point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7) by navigating around the walls in the maze. It goes through the open spaces and avoids the walls marked with hash signs. The solution avoids any dead ends and leads directly to the exit point.
