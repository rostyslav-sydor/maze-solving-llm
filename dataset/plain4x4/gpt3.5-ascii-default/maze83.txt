One possible solution for this maze is:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,5) (6,4) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution involves moving down the first column, then across to the right side of the maze, and finally navigating towards the exit point at (7,7). To reach the endpoint, the path avoids walls indicated by hash signs and proceeds along the open spaces available.
