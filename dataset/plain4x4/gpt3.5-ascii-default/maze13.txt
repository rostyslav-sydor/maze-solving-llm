This path starts at the entry point (1,1) and follows a route through the maze, navigating around walls and obstacles, until reaching the exit point (7,7). The solution traverses through the maze in a systematic way following a series of right-angle turns to avoid hitting walls. The final coordinates of the path are listed within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens in the specified format.
