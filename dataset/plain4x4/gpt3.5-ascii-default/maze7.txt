One possible solution for this maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1), follows along the left wall towards the top, then navigates through the middle of the maze to reach the exit point at (7,7). The path avoids hitting any walls and successfully reaches the end point.
