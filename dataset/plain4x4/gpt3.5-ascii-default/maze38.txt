One possible solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (5,6) (5,5) (5,4) (5,3) (5,2) (6,2) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) <PATH_END>

In this solution, the path starts at coordinate (1,1) (S) and follows a route towards the exit point at coordinate (7,7) (E), navigating through the maze while avoiding the walls marked with hash signs. This solution is just one possible path among many that could be taken to reach the exit.
