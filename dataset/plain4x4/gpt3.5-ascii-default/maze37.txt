The solution for the maze is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1) and follows the open spaces to reach the exit point (7,7) without crossing any walls. The path avoids the blocked areas and takes the most direct route to the exit. The coordinates of each step are listed in the format specified.
