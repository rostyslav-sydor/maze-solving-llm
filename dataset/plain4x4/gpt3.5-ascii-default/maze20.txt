One possible solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path moves down from the starting point (S) at (1,1) to reach the exit point (E) at (7,7) by making a series of left and down moves while avoiding the walls marked by hash signs. The path takes a total of 13 steps to reach the exit. By following this path, you can successfully navigate through the maze and reach the exit point.
