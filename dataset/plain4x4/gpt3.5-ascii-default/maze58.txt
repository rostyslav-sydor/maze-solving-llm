<Path_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (1,1) and move down through the path to reach the exit point (7,7). We navigate around the walls by moving through the open spaces, making sure to avoid dead ends and backtrack when necessary. By following this path, we successfully reach the exit point while avoiding any obstacles along the way. The solution path is represented by the coordinates listed between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
