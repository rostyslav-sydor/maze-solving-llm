One possible solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <PATH_END>

This solution follows a path that starts at the entry point (1,1), moves down to reach the bottom of the maze, then proceeds right to the exit point at (7,7). The coordinates are listed in the format specified between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens. This path avoids the walls marked by hash signs and successfully reaches the exit point.
