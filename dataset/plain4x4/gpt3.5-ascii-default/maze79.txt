The solution path for the given maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (5,7) (4,7) (3,7) (2,7) (2,6) (2,5) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (2,6) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) <PATH_END>

The path starts at (1,1) which is the entry point 'S' and follows a series of movements through open spaces while avoiding the walls denoted by hash signs. It eventually reaches the exit point 'E' at coordinate (7,7). This solution path is a valid route that successfully navigates the maze from start to finish.
