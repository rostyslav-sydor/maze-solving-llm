<Path_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This is one of the possible solutions for the maze. The path starts at the entry point (1,1) and follows a series of moves to navigate through the maze and reach the exit point at (7,7). The path avoids the walls marked with hash signs and successfully reaches the destination within the constraints of the maze layout. This solution demonstrates a way to solve the maze and find the shortest path from the start to the end point.
