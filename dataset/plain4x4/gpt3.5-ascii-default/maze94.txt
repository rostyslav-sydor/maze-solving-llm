The solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path follows a route that avoids the walls and leads from the entry point (1,1) to the exit point (7,7). The path goes down the first column, then follows the outer edge of the maze until reaching the exit point.
