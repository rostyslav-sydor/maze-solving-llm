<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (4,5) (3,5) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <Path_End> 

This path starts at the entry point (1,1), then moves down the maze until reaching row 5. From there, it goes right to column 2, then up and across to column 5. It proceeds down again to reach column 7, where it turns right and moves to the exit point at (7,7). The given solution is one of many possible paths through the maze.
