The solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path leads from the entry point (1,1) at the top left corner to the exit point (7,7) at the bottom right corner, navigating through the maze by following the open passages and avoiding the walls. The solution is a series of coordinates in the format of row and column, indicating the path taken to reach the exit.
