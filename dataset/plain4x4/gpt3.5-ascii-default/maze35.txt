One possible solution for this maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To start the path, we move down from the starting point at (1,1) until we reach the first intersection at (4,1). From there, we continue moving right until we reach the upper right corner at (4,4). Then, we move down until reaching the bottom row, where we then move left until we reach the exit at (7,7).

This path avoids all walls to reach the exit successfully.
