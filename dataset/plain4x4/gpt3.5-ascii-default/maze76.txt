<Path_Start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <Path_End> 

This is one possible solution to navigate through the maze from the starting point (S) at (1,1) to the exit point (E) at (7,7). The path follows the open spaces while avoiding the walls represented by the hash signs.
