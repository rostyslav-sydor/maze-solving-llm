To solve this maze, one possible path is as follows: 

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (5,6) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

Starting from the entry point at (1,1), the path moves down until reaching row 4. Then it moves right until reaching column 3, then down again to reach the exit point at (7,7).

This solution avoids the walls represented by hash signs and successfully navigates the maze from the entry point to the exit point. The path is enclosed in the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens for clarity.
