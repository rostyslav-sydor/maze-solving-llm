The solution for this maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts from the entry point at (1,1), follows the path along the corridors, and reaches the exit point at (7,7). The solution avoids the walls marked by hash signs and takes the shortest path to reach the exit.
