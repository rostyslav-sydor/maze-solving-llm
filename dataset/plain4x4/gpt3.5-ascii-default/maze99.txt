One possible solution for the maze is as follows:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entry point (1,1), goes down to the bottom of the maze, then navigates through the corridors to reach the exit point (7,7). The path avoids the walls marked with hash signs to find the way out of the maze.
