<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

To solve the maze, we start at the entry point (1,1) and follow a path that avoids the walls marked by hash signs. We make our way towards the exit point (7,7) by navigating through the open spaces in the maze. By following the path mentioned above, we successfully reach the exit point and complete the maze.

The solution shows the coordinates in the format of (row, column) between <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens, indicating the path taken to navigate through the maze. This path avoids the walls and leads directly from the entry point to the exit point.
