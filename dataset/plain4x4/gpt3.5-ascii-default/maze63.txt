<Path_start> (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (7,7) <Path_end>

To solve this maze, follow these steps: 
- Start at the entry point (1,1)
- Move down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), and continue moving right until reaching (2,4)
- Move down to (3,4), then follow the path to (4,4), (5,4), and (5,5)
- Continue moving down to (6,5) and then to (6,6)
- Finally, move right to reach the exit point at (7,7)

This path avoids all walls and reaches the exit efficiently.
