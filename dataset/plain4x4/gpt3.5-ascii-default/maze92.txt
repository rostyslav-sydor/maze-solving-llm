<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END> 

This solution involves navigating through the maze by moving in a sequence of up, right, down, right, down, left, down, right, down, right, down, left, down, right, right, right, up, and finally right to reach the exit at coordinate (7,7). The path avoids the walls represented by hash signs and follows a clear route towards the exit point.
