To find a solution to this maze, we can use the depth-first search algorithm. Starting at the entry point (1,1), we can move through the maze while keeping track of the visited cells to avoid revisiting them. By exploring all possible paths until we reach the exit point (7,7), we can find the shortest path.

One possible solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This path follows a route through the maze that avoids the walls and leads from the entry point to the exit point.

By using the depth-first search algorithm, we were able to efficiently find a solution to the maze by exploring all possible paths. This solution can be used to navigate the maze successfully from start to finish.
