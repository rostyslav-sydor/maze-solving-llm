The solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (3,6) (2,6) (2,5) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (2,7) (3,7) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (6,6) (6,5) (7,5) (7,4) (7,3) (7,2) (7,1) <PATH_END>

This path starts at the entrance (1,1), navigates through the maze, and successfully reaches the exit point (7,7). The path avoids the walls marked by hash signs and follows an optimal route to reach the destination.
