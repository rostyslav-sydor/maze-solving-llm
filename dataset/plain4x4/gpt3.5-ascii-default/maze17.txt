<Path_start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (5,7) (6,7) (7,7) <PATH_END>

The solution to this maze involves moving down vertically until reaching row 4, then navigating through the maze to reach the exit at coordinate (7,7). The path moves through open spaces while avoiding walls marked with hash signs. This specific route ensures the shortest path from the starting point at coordinate (1,1) to the exit at coordinate (7,7).
