<Path_start> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) <Path_end> 

This solution path starts from the entry point at (1,1) and follows a winding path through the maze, avoiding the walls marked with hash signs. It eventually reaches the exit point at (7,7). The path moves in a mostly downward direction, navigating through open spaces and corridors to reach the final destination. The maze is successfully solved with this path that is represented by the series of coordinates within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens.
