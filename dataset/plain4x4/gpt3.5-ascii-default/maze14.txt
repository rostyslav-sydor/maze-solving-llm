<Path_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (4,4) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (3,8) (4,8) (5,8) (6,8) (7,8) <PATH_END> 

This solution passes through the maze by following a path that avoids the walls, starting from the entry point at (1,1) and reaching the exit point at (7,7). The coordinates listed within the <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> tokens represent the steps taken to navigate through the maze.
