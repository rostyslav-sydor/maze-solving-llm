One possible solution for the maze is as follows:
<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (6,3) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

This solution starts from the entry point at (1,1) and follows a path through the maze to reach the exit point at (7,7). It avoids the walls marked with hash signs and navigates through the open spaces to find the optimal route to the exit. By following this path, one can successfully navigate through the maze and reach the end point.
