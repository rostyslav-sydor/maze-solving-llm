To solve the maze, we start from the origin point marked (0,0) and we aim to get to the target point (3,3) by navigating through the connections given in the adjacency list.

We observe the adjacency list to find the paths:
1. Start at (0,0) which connects directly to (1,0).
2. From (1,0) we can only follow the path to (0,1) as (1,1) leads to a longer path.
3. From (0,1) move to (0,2).
4. At (0,2) we can continue to (1,2), which then directly connects to (2,2).
5. At (2,2), go to (2,3) then to (1,3).
6. From (1,3) finally reach (3,3) through (2,3) and (3,2).

With this assessment, we outline the path through the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
