To solve the maze provided, I first interpret the adjacency list format to understand the connectivity of the nodes in a graph. Each pair in the list reflects a path between two points given in two-dimensional space `(row, column)` format.

Starting from the origin `(0,0)` and aiming to reach the target `(3,3)`, using the please given adjacency relationships for each node or vertex, we can trace the following simplest path:

1. Move from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)` since they are directly connected.
2. Proceed to `(2,0)`, which is linked to `(1,0)`.
3. Next, go to `(2,1)` connected to `(2,0)`.
4. Shift to `(1,1)`, which links directly from `(2,1)`.
5. Move to `(1,2)` which connects to `(1,1)`.
6. Head to `(1,3)` from `(1,2)`.
7. Proceed to `(2,3)` from `(1,3)`.
8. Finally, reach the target by moving from `(2,3)` to `(3,3)`.

Thus, the path can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path traverses through the maze following available connections, leading directly from the origin to the target.
