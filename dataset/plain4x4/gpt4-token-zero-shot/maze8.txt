To solve the maze, I'll convert the adjacency list into a more workable format, creating a map of each point and its connections. Then, I’ll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Here’s a summarized plan of the BFS:

1. Parse the adjacency list into a dictionary where each key is a point and each value is a list of connected points.
2. Initialize a queue for BFS which starts with the origin point.
3. Use a set to keep track of visited points to avoid revisiting.
4. For each point dequeued, check its neighbors (from the adjacency dictionary) and enqueue any that haven't been visited.
5. Stop when the target point is reached.
6. Track the path using a predecessor dictionary where every key's value is the point from which it was reached.

After the BFS search identifies the shortest path to the target, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target to the origin using the predecessor dictionary.

Here’s the resultant path traced:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This is the shortest route from the entry to the exit of the maze following the given adjacency list.
