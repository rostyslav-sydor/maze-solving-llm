To solve the maze, we'll use an adjacency list representation to determine a path from point (0,0) to (3,3) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The adjacency list is deciphered as follows:

- (1,0) <-> (0,0)
- (3,3) <-> (2,3)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (1,3) <-> (1,2)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (3,0) <-> (3,1)
- (1,2) <-> (1,1)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,1)
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (2,0) <-> (2,1)
- (3,2) <-> (2,2)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)

Using BFS, starting at (0,0), the algorithm explores neighbors, respecting the connections provided until it reaches the target node (3,3):

1. From (0,0), queue moves to node (1,0), and (0,1).
2. From (1,0), next is (2,0).
3. From (0,1), queue includes (1,1).
4. From (2,0), next is (2,1).
5. From (1,1), next is (1,2).
6. Continue exploring until reaching (3,3).

The resultant path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
