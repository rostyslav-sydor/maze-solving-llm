To solve the maze, I'll first note down all the connections between points:

- (1,0) ↔ (1,1)
- (3,3) ↔ (3,2)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,2)
- (2,3) ↔ (3,3)
- (3,0) ↔ (2,0)
- (2,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (2,1) ↔ (2,0)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,0)
- (0,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (0,1) ↔ (1,1)
- (0,1) ↔ (0,2)
- (0,3) ↔ (0,2)
- (0,0) ↔ (1,0)
- (2,2) ↔ (2,3)
- (1,2) ↔ (1,3)

Here, the entry point is at (0,0) and the exit point is at (3,3).

Using a pathfinding strategy (like BFS), we can find a path through the maze:

1. Start from (0,0), move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), you can go either to (0,1) or continue to (1,2).
4. From (1,2), continue to (1,3) and then (0,3).
5. From (0,3), move to (0,2).
6. Go back to a point connected to the target, from (0,2) to (2,2).
7. From (2,2), move to (2,3) and then to (3,3).

Marking the path from entry to exit results in:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
