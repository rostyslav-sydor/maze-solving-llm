The adjacency list provided describes the connectivity between the cells of the maze. Starting from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(3,3)`, we need to navigate through a series of connected cells.

Analyzing the connections given:
1. From `(0,0)`, we can move to `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`.
2. Continuing from each of these possible paths:
   - From `(0,1)` -> `(1,1)`
   - From `(1,0)` -> `(2,0)` -> `(3,0)`

Let's build the path from `(3,0)` upwards since it is on the same column as the target `(3,3)`:
3. From `(3,0)` -> `(3,1)` -> `(3,2)` -> `(3,3)`

Since the path through `(3,0)` to `(3,3)` forms a direct path, this becomes an optimal route.

So, the path from `(0,0)` to `(3,3)` is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
