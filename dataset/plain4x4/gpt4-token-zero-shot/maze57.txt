To solve the maze, we traverse from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) using the adjacency list provided.

From the starting point of (0,0):
1. We can move to (1,0) based on the adjacency list.
2. From (1,0) we can move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1) we can move to (0,1).
4. From (0,1) we can continue to (0,2).
5. From (0,2) we can go to (0,3).
6. From (0,3) we can move to (1,3).
7. From (1,3), we can move to (2,3).
8. From (2,3) we can move to (3,3) which is the exit point.

Putting these together, the complete path from start to finish is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path moves consistently through adjacent points, respecting the given connections, and ensures arrival at the exit point.
