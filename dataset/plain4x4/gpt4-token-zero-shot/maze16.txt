To solve the maze, let's analyze the provided adjacency list and apply a pathfinding algorithm (like BFS) to navigate from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

From the adjacency list:

- (0,0) → (0,1)
- (0,1) → (0,2)
- (0,2) → (0,3)
- (0,3) → (1,3)
- (1,3) → (2,3)
- (2,3) → (3,3)

We can trace the least number of moves required to reach from point (0,0) to (3,3) as follows:
1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (0,1) - Connected directly
3. Move to (0,2) - Connected directly
4. Move to (0,3) - Connected directly
5. Move to (1,3) - Connected directly from (0,3)
6. Move to (2,3) - Connected directly from (1,3)
7. Move to (3,3) - Connected directly from (2,3)

Thus, the path from the origin to the target is a relatively direct one as the adjacency list connects each node along the row 0 up to (0,3) and then hops vertically down to the target at (3,3).

Formatted output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
