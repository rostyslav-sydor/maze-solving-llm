To solve the maze, we begin at the origin coordinate (0,0) and aim to reach the target coordinate (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. The path finding will follow a search technique like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), considering how edges connect to each node. Here is the step-by-step route:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Using the adjacency pairs: Move to (0,1).
3. From (0,1), go to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), proceed to (1,2).
5. From (1,2), move to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), go to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), proceed to (3,3), which is the target.

Thus, the solution path through the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
