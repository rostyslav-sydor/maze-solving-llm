To solve the maze, we'll begin at the entry point (0,0) and navigate through connected passages to reach the exit point (3,3).

1. Start at (0,0). Adjacent is (1,0) and (0,1). We choose (1,0).
2. From (1,0), move to (1,1) which connects directly.
3. From (1,1), move to (2,1).
4. From (2,1), proceed to (3,1).
5. From (3,1), go to (3,0). Then directly from there to (3,2), and then (3,3), the exit.

We link these steps in sequence, ensuring each move is legally connected per the adjacency list.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
