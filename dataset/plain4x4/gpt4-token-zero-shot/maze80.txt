To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, we first interpret the list to understand how each point is connected. Starting from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we will follow a path using Breadth-First Search (BFS) since it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

By examining the adjacency list:

- (0,0) connects to (1,0) and (0,1)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (0,2) connects to (1,2) and (0,1)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (1,0) connects to (0,0)
- (1,1) connects to (1,2) and (2,1)
- (1,2) connects to (1,1) and (1,3)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3), (1,2), and (2,3)
- (2,0) connects to (3,0) and (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0) and (1,1)
- (2,2) connects to (2,3)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3), (2,2), and (3,3)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1) and (2,0)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0) and (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1) and (3,3)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3) and (3,2)

Using this information, the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) can be deduced. The path might look like:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path uses a logical progression through each row, taking advantage of the direct connections available from the origin point to the destination.
