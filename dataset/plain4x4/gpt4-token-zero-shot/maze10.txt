To solve the maze, we must interpret the adjacency list of connected coordinates and find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

From the adjacency list, the links can be summarized as:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (2,0) connects to (3,0) and (2,1)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- Other connections exist within the maze, but the path mentioned above is a direct connection from the start to the end.

Therefore, following this connection from (0,0) to (3,3):
- Begin at (0,0), move vertically down to (1,0), then to (2,0)
- Continue to move down to (3,0)
- Shift right from (3,0) to (3,1), then to (3,2)
- Finally, move right to reach the target at (3,3)

Summarizing the path, we get:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
