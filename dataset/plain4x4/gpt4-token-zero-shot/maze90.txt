The given adjacency list describes all possible movements within the maze. The origin is at (0,0) and the target is (3,3). To solve the maze, we need to find a path that connects the origin to the target using the connections described in the adjacency list.

1. **Starting point** is (0,0) and we look for adjoining points from the adjacency list.
2. We can move from (0,0) to (1,0) as they are directly connected.
3. From (1,0), we move to (1,1).
4. Proceed from (1,1) to (2,1).
5. Next from (2,1) to (3,1).
6. Move from (3,1) to (3,2).
7. Finally, we go from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the exit.

Following this path provides a successful route from the start to the finish of the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
