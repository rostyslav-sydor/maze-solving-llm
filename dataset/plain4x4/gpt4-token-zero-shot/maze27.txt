From the adjacency list provided, we can manually trace a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) as follows:

1. Start at (0,0)
2. Move to (1,0) - as provided by `(1,0) <--> (0,0)`
3. Go to (2,0) - connected with `(1,0) <--> (2,0)`
4. Proceed to (3,0) - via `(2,0) <--> (3,0)`
5. Move up to (3,1) - through `(3,0) <--> (3,1)`
6. Continue to (3,2) - connected by `(3,1) <--> (3,2)`
7. Reach the final node (3,3) - from `(3,3) <--> (2,3)`

So, the path in coordinate format would be listed as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
