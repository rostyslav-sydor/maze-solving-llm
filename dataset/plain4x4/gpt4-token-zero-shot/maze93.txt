To solve the maze, we first interpret the adjacency list of the graph to understand the connections between maze positions (coordinates as pairs of (row, column)).

1. From the adjacency list:
   - Every pair shows direct connections among cells. For example, (1,2) <--> (1,3) indicates movement is possible from cell (1,2) to (1,3) and vice versa.

2. The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).

3. To find the path:
   - Start at (0,0) and follow connected nodes reaching the destination (3,3) by checking each possible route.
   - Given cells and their connections, we need to explore paths using potentially depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) techniques, tracking paths that lead towards the target and avoiding loops.
   - Essentially, from (0,0), explore routes through connections, e.g., to (0,1) then (0,2) and so forth, following the connections until (3,3) is reached.

4. A potential path (solving manually for this discussion and keeping constraint on word count):
   - From (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,2), moving to (1,2), then (1,3), from there to (2,3), to (2,2), then (3,2), and finally reaching (3,3).

Hence, the path <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> represents the solution from your provided adjacency list from the maze's entry to exit.
