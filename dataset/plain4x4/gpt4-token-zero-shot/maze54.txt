Analyzing the adjacency list provided, we can manually find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) within the maze's structure.

From the starting node (0,0), the possible adjacent node is (1,0) as given in the list.
Next, from (1,0) we can travel to (2,0), then proceed from (2,0) to (2,1).
From (2,1), our options include moving to the initial point (1,1), but considering our direction to the target, we move from (2,1) to (2,2).
Proceeding from (2,2), moving to (2,3) keeps us on track towards the target.
From (2,3), we can go directly to (1,3) or (3,3), but heading to (1,3) first since it aligns with our target direction.
Moving up from (1,3) to (1,2), allows us to approach the destination in the more straightforward route.
From (1,2) to (1,3), returning us back to the coordinate closer to our target.
Finally, from (1,3) we directly proceed to (0,3), and from there, move to (0,2). Realizing it's a slight backtrack, the corrected direction to take is from (1,3) directly traversing to (3,3) hitting the target.

Thus, the path will be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
