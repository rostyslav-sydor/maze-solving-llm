To solve the maze described in the adjacency list format, I first need to construct a usable representation from the given edges and identify a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using an appropriate search technique like BFS.

**Step 1: Parse the adjacency list:**
From the provided tokens, create a graph:
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (0,3)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,0) 
- (2,0) is connected to (3,0) and (1,0)
- (1,2) is connected to (1,1) 
- (3,1) is connected to (3,2) and (3,0)
- (2,3) is connected to (2,2), (1,3), and (3,3)
- (3,3) is connected to (3,2) 
- (2,2) is connected to (2,1)
- (1,3) is connected to (0,3) 
- And others

**Step 2: Search the path using BFS or DFS:**
Starting from (0,0), mark as visited and explore its connections:
- From (0,0), move to (0,1)
- From (0,1), move to (0,2)
- From (0,2), move to (0,3)
- From (0,3), move to (1,3)
- From (1,3), move to (2,3)
- From (2,3), move to (3,3)

Tracking these movements, I get the required path.

**Final Output:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
