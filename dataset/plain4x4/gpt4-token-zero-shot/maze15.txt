To solve the maze using the given adjacency list and find a path between the origin (0,0) and the target (3,3), I looked for a sequence of connected nodes:

**Starting Point:** (0,0)
1. Move from (0,0) to (0,1) - as per connection (0,0) <--> (0,1).
2. Move from (0,1) to (0,2) - as per connection (0,2) <--> (0,1).
3. From here, there's no direct path from (0,2) to our desired row 1 or 3 nodes directly. So we retreat to find an alternative route:
   - Move back to (0,1) and then to (0,0).
   - Move from (0,0) to (1,0) - as per connection (1,0) <--> (0,0).
4. Move from (1,0) to (2,0) - as per connection (2,0) <--> (1,0).
5. Move from (2,0) to (3,0) - as per connection (2,0) <--> (3,0).
6. Move from (3,0) to (3,1) - as per connection (3,1) <--> (3,0).
7. Move from (3,1) to (3,2) - as per connection (3,2) <--> (3,1).
8. Move from (3,2) to (3,3) - as per connection (3,3) <--> (3,2).

**Final Path from (0,0) to (3,3):**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
This path reflects a clear route through connections available from the adjacency list provided without attempting cycles or unnecessary diversions.
