To solve the maze given in the adjacency list, we will use a path-finding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) since it effectively discovers the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The adjacency list represents the connections between points in a grid:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore all possible moves from a given point, using the adjacency relationships.
3. Mark each visited coordinate to avoid revisiting.
4. Track the path to backtrack the route once the target (3,3) is located.
5. Continue until reaching the target or until all accessible nodes are visited.

From the adjacency list:

- Analyze neighbors and construct a way to navigate through them efficiently. Each coordinate can connect as specified, and these paths can be followed in BFS or DFS order to reach from (0,0) to (3,3).

Running BFS from the origin:

1. Start from (0,0).
2. Accessible moves are to (1,0), since it's directly connected.
3. Continue moving and checking connections:
   - From (1,0) to (1,1) and so on, linking up with the chains per each direct connection.
4. The final path flows as moves link directly or indirectly to (3,3).

Based on the BFS search, the successful path from (0,0) to (3,3) would look like:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

Each step was chosen based on existing legal moves provided in the adjacency list until the destination was reached.
