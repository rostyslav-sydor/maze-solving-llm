First, we interpret the given maze's adjacency list into a more readable structure, mapping each coordinate to its directly connected neighboring coordinates. 

Given:
- (0,2) connects to (0,1) and (1,2)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1)
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (1,2) connects to (0,2) and (2,2)
- (2,2) connects to (1,2), (2,3), and (1,3)
- (2,3) connects to (2,2), (3,3), and (1,3)
- (3,3) connects to (3,2) and (2,3)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1) and (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (1,1) and (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0) and (2,1)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1) and (2,0)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0) and (3,0)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3) and (2,3)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)

Using this graph, we need to find the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Starting at (0,0), we explore adjacent nodes that provide a path to the target coordinate:

1. From (0,0) to (0,1)
2. From (0,1) to (0,2)
3. From (0,2) to (1,2)
4. From (1,2) to (2,2)
5. From (2,2) to (2,3)
6. From (2,3) to (3,3)

Thus, the solution path for the maze is: 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
