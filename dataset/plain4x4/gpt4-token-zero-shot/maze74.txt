The given adjacency list represents a maze where each edge represents a path between two cells in a 2D grid. First, let's decipher the paths between the cells from the adjacency list mentioned:

- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (2,2)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3)
- (2,2) connects to (2,3), (1,2), and (3,2)
- (1,0) connects to (0,0) and (1,1)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0)
- (1,2) connects to (2,2)
- (3,3) connects to (3,2)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2)
- (0,2) connects to (0,3) and (0,1)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3), (3,1), and (2,2)
- (3,0) connects to (2,0)
- (2,0) connects to (3,0) and (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0) and (3,1)

Starting from the origin (0,0) and aiming to reach the target (3,3), a valid path traced through the connections is as follows:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move to (0,1)
- Move to (0,2)
- Move to (0,3)
- Move to (1,3)
- Move to (2,3)
- Move to (2,2)
- Move to (3,2)
- Move to (3,3), the exit

This path successfully connects entry to exit by adhering to the allowed paths indicated in the adjacency list.

Encapsulating the solution path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
