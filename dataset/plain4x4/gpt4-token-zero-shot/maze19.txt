To solve the maze, I'll use the adjacency list to determine the shortest path from the origin at (0,0) to the target at (3,3). By examining connections, we build a path through connected nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

Adjacency list breakdown (undirected maze connections):
- (3,2) <-> (3,1)
- (3,1) <-> (2,1)
- (3,0) <-> (2,0) 
- (0,1) <-> (0,0)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (2,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,1) <-> (1,0)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (2,2) <-> (2,3)
- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (1,2) <-> (1,3)
- (0,1) <-> (1,1)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)
- (2,1) <-> (2,2)

Using this adjacency list:
- Start from (0,0), explore neighbors and progressively reach (3,3) through connected nodes.
- Planning a BFS from (0,0) to (3,3) identifies this path:
  
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path reflects a sequence of achievable movements, connecting directly from entrance to exit, navigating through permissible passages detailed in the adjacency list.
