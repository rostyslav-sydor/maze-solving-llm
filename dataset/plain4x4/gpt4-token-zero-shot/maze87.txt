To solve the maze, we will visualize the maze's structure based on the adjacency list provided, and then determine a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (3,3).

**Graph Visualization:**
- From the adjacency list, each coordinate pair represents a cell in the maze, and the connections (<-->) indicate the possible pathways directly accessible from one cell to another.

**Determine Path:**
- We'll follow a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Without implementing code, we can conceptually deduce the path by tracing through the maze using the given connections.

**Tracing the Path:**
1. Start at (0,0). The adjacent node is (0,1).
2. Move to (0,1). Available moves are to (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1). Since we started from (0,0), we opt for (0,2).
3. From (0,2), options are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). Moving forward, select (0,3).
4. At (0,3), adjacent is only (0,2), which is backtrack. We switch to approach via (1,2) (from (0,2) instead of moving to (0,3)).
5. From (1,2) move to (1,3).
6. Now at (1,3), accessible nodes are (2,3) and back to (1,2). Moving to (2,3).
7. From (2,3) move to (3,3) as itâ€™s adjacent to (3,2), then (3,3) is accessible.

By following this thought process, we deduce the path:

**Final Path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path allows you to traverse the maze from start to end based on the provided schematic of connections.
