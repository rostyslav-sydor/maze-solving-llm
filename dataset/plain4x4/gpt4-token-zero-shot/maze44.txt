To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (3,3).

We convert the adjacency list to a more readable graph format:
- (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) and (1,0)
- (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) and (1,1)
- (0,2) is adjacent to (0,3)
- (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) and (1,3)
- (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) and (2,0)
- (1,1) is adjacent to (0,1), (1,2)
- (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,3)
- (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), (0,3), and (2,3)
- (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0), (2,1)
- (2,1) is adjacent to (2,0)
- (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2)
- (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) and (3,3)
- (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1)
- (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0), (3,2)
- (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1), (3,3), (2,2)
- (3,3) is adjacent to (2,3), (3,2)

Starting at (0,0):
- From (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (1,1)
- From (1,1) to (1,2)
- From (1,2) to (1,3)
- From (1,3) to (2,3)
- From (2,3) to (3,3)

Hence, the shortest route from the origin to destination becomes:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
