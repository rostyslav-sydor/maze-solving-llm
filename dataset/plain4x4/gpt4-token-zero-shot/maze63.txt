First, let's define the graph from the adjacency list provided:

- Nodes with their connected nodes:
  - (2,0): (1,0), (3,0)
  - (1,0): (2,0)
  - (1,2): (1,3), (1,1)
  - (0,1): (0,2)
  - (1,3): (0,3), (2,3)
  - (0,3): (1,3), (0,2)
  - (3,1): (2,1), (3,0)
  - (2,3): (2,2), (1,3)
  - (3,2): (2,2), (3,3)
  - (0,0): (0,1)
  - (3,0): (2,0), (3,1)
  - (2,2): (2,3), (3,2)
  - (2,1): (3,1), (1,1)
  - (3,3): (3,2)

Now we trace the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3):
- From (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3)
- From (0,3) to (1,3) to (2,3)
- From (2,3) to (3,3), which is the exit.

The path in the desired format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
