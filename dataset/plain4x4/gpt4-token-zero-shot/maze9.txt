To solve the maze, we first need to interpret the adjacency list and then find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

From the adjacency list, it's clear that nodes representing coordinates can connect directly if listed:

1. Start at (0,0), which is the entry point. Look for coordinates that can be reached from (0,0): these are (1,0) and (0,1).

2. From (0,1), you can go to (0,2).

3. From (0,2), proceed to (0,3).

4. Then from (0,3), move to (1,3).

5. From (1,3), continue to (1,2).

6. From (1,2), go to (2,2).

7. Then from (2,2), move to (2,3).

8. Finally from (2,3), reach the target at (3,3).

So the path from the origin to the target following the connectivity given in the adjacency list is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is one possible path that successfully moves through the maze to reach the target using valid transitions as per the adjacency details.
