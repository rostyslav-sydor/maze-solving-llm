To solve the maze described in the adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can visualize the connections between coordinates as edges in a graph and use a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Starting from (0,0), let's initiate the BFS, exploring all possible paths through the maze:

1. From (0,0), you can go to (0,1) and (1,0).
2. From (0,1), you can move to (0,2) or stay connected to (0,0).
3. From (1,0), you can move to (1,1).
4. From (0,2), there are connections to (0,3) and (1,2).
5. From (1,1), connectivity is ensured to (2,1).
6. From (0,3), the path connects directly upward, though it's not needed for this particular solution.
7. From (1,2), paths extend to (1,3) and link back to neighboring nodes.
8. From (2,1), one can move to both (3,1) and continue horizontally to (3,0).
9. From (1,3), transitioning occurs to (2,3).
10. From (3,1), there are pathways to (3,2) as well as back to the starting rows.
11. Through (3,2), you can advance to the final destination, which is (3,3).

By following these steps, the successful route from (0,0) to (3,3) is mapped out:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path effectively utilizes the given connections in the adjacency list, ensuring each move corresponds to an allowable node transition described by the adjacency pairs.
