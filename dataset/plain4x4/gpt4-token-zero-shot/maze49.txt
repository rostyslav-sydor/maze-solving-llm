To solve the maze with the specified adjacency list, we'll start from the origin, navigate through the connected points, and try to reach the target. Here, the graphâ€™s edges list the possible movements between adjacent points.

Based on this, let's analyze and track the path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1. From (0,0), we can move to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move along (1,1).
3. Progress further from (1,1) to (0,1) or (2,1). Let's go to (2,1). 
4. Advance from (2,1) to (3,1).
5. Move from (3,1) to (3,0) or (2,0). Let's take (3,0).
6. Continue from (3,0) to (2,0).
7. From (2,0), proceed to (2,3) directly, though let's choose the next step as (3,2) for the solution.
8. Move from (3,2) to (3,3), which is the target.

Given these movements, we've traced a feasible path through the maze from (0,0) to (3,3). Following the connections, this path successfully reaches the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (2,0) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
