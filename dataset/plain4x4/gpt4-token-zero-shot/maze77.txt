To find a path through the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided, follow this reasoning:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. From (0,0), feasible moves are to (1,0) and (0,1). Select (0,1) as it moves toward the right, generally toward the target.
3. From (0,1), go to (0,2).
4. From (0,2), two moves are possible: back to (0,1) or to (1,2). Choose (1,2).
5. From (1,2), options include (1,1), (1,3), and (0,2). Move to (1,3).
6. From (1,3), move to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), the option is (3,3), the target.

Now reconstruct the path in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
