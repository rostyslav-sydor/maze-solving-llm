To solve the maze, we need to identify a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided.

First, let's convert the given adjacency list into a more structured format:
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)
- (0,1) connects to (0,2) and (0,0)
- (0,2) connects to (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)
- (1,0) connects to (1,1) and (2,0)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0) and (2,1)
- (1,2) connects to (1,3) and (0,2)
- (1,3) connects to (1,2) and (2,3)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0)
- (2,1) connects to (1,1) and (2,2)
- (2,2) connects to (2,1) and (3,2)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (3,3)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0) and (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,1), (3,3), and (2,2)
- (3,3) connects to (2,3) and (3,2)

Now, trace a path from (0,0) to (3,3):
1. Starting at (0,0), move to (0,1).
2. Move from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. Move from (0,2) to (1,2).
4. Move from (1,2) to (1,3).
5. Move from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. Finally, move from (2,3) to (3,3).

Thus, the path from the origin to the target is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
