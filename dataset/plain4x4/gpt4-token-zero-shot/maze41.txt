To solve the maze, we start by constructing the adjacency list from the given description and then use a pathfinding method, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here's how the maze is navigated:

Starting from the origin (0,0), you can move to (0,1), then from (0,1) to (1,1).
From (1,1), you then proceed to (2,1) and can then go to (3,1).
From (3,1), move to (3,2) and then to (3,3), which is the target.

This route is the simplest and most direct based on understanding the adjacency connections provided. Hence, the solution of the path from entry to exit through the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
