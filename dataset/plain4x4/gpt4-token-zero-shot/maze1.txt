To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) in the provided maze, represented as an adjacency list, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. The BFS approach ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

From the adjacency list, we have the connections between coordinates. Starting from (0,0) and following the connections:

1. Start at (0,0) and check its neighbors. We are allowed to move to (1,0) or (0,1).
2. From (1,0), proceed to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), move to (3,0).
4. From (3,0), move to (3,1).
5. From (3,1), move next to (3,2).
6. Finally, from (3,2) move to the exit at (3,3).

This path traverses across the maze from the bottom left to the top right, consistently checking for possible moves based on the adjacency list.

With this path in mind, here's the formatted solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
