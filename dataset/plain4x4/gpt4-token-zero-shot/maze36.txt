To find a solution for the maze, I will interpret the adjacency list and trace a path from the origin to the target using strategies such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Here is how I would deduce the path:

1. Start at the origin: (0,0)

2. From the adjacency list, infer the connections:
   - (0,0) connects to (0,1)
   - (0,1) connects to (0,2)
   - (0,2) connects to (0,3) and (1,2)
   - (0,3) connects to (1,3)
   - Thus, continue through connections: (0,1) to (0,2) to (0,3) to (1,3)

3. From (1,3) observe further connections:
   - (1,3) also connects to (2,3)
   - Proceed from (1,3) to (2,3)

4. From (2,3) finalize movement towards the target:
   - (2,3) connects to (3,3)

There is the path from (0,0) going through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), and finally to (3,3).

Hence, the list of coordinates representing the correct path from entry to exit in the maze is formatted like this:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
