First, let us parse the adjacency list to understand the connections between different coordinates in the maze:

- (3,3) connects to (2,3)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0)
- (1,3) connects to (2,3)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2)
- (3,1) connects to (3,0)
- (0,3) connects to (0,2)
- (3,1) connects to (2,1)
- (1,1) connects to (0,1)
- (1,2) connects to (1,1)
- (2,0) connects to (2,1)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0)
- (0,1) connects to (0,2)
- (1,2) connects to (2,2)

The entry point of the maze is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3). We need to find a path from the entry to the exit.

From analysis and attempts using the adjacency, paths can be found but navigating through nodes, ensuring all connections are utilized:

Path from (0,0) to (3,3) would go through:
- From (0,0) to (0,1) via connected points
- Then to (0,2), as it connects directly
- Proceed to (1,2) by connection
- Move to (2,2) following the direct link
- Enter (3,3) finally via connected points from (2,3)

Thus, the path in the required format can be expressed as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
