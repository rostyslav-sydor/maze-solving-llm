To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list format, we first need to understand the connections between points, then determine a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) by traversing through the connected nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can construct the graph:
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0) and (0,1).
- (1,0) is connected to (2,0).
- (2,0) is connected to (3,0) and (1,0).
- (3,0) is connected to (3,1).
- (0,1) is connected to (0,0) and (0,2).
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (0,3).
- (0,3) is connected to (0,2) and (1,3).
- (1,3) is connected to (0,3) and (1,2).
- (1,2) is connected to (1,1) and (1,3).
- (1,1) is connected to (1,2) and (2,1).
- (2,1) is connected to (1,1) and (2,2).
- (2,2) is connected to (2,1) and (3,2).
- (3,1) is connected to (3,0) and (3,2).
- (3,2) is connected to (3,1), (3,3), and (2,2).
- (3,3) is connected to (3,2) and (2,3).
- (2,3) is connected to (2,2) and (3,3).

Starting from the origin (0,0), the path to (3,3):

1. Move from (0,0) to (1,0).
2. From (1,0) to (2,0).
3. From (2,0) to (3,0).
4. From (3,0) to (3,1).
5. From (3,1) to (3,2).
6. From (3,2) to (3,3).

Thus, the path coordinates are:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
