To find the solution for the maze, we need to convert the adjacency list into a usable format that describes the layout of the maze. Then we can apply pathfinding algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 

Parsing the adjacency list, we establish connections between the nodes (coordinates in the maze) as indicated by the list. Here’s a quick breakdown:

1. Parse the maze data from the formatted adjacency list.
2. Convert nodes and their relationships (edges) into a graph structure.
3. Use a pathfinding algorithm on this graph structure.
4. Start at the origin node (0,0) and attempt to reach the target node (3,3).
5. Output the path following the specified format.

Considering the nodes and prescribed links in your representation, let’s find the path and present it in the required format.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This response streamlines only relevant steps and directly leads from start to finish as per the adjacency connections given. This path avoids dead-ends and takes a straightforward route that connects the entry point to the exit, mapping through accessible paths only.
