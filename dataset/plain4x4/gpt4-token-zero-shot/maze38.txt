To solve the given maze, we first transform it into a more in-depth visualization. We'll create a clear understanding by reinterpreting the connections between cells and establishing our start and target positions:

The maze connections are as follows:
- (3,3) connects to (3,2) and (2,3)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3) and (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2) and (3,0)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1), (2,0)
- (2,3) connects to (1,3) and (3,3)
- (1,3) connects to (0,3) and (2,3)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (2,2) connects to (1,2) and (2,1)
- (2,1) connects to (2,0) and (2,2)
- (2,0) connects to (1,0) and (2,1) and (3,0)
- (1,2) connects to (0,2) and (2,2)
- (1,1) connects to (1,0) and (0,1)
- (1,0) connects to (1,1) and (2,0)
- (0,2) connects to (1,2)
- (0,1) connects to (0,0) and (1,1)
- (0,0) connects to (0,1)

Entry (origin) is at (0,0) and the exit (target) is at (3,3).

The solution path taken from the entry to the exit would go through these movements, ensuring each steps connects to the next:
- From (0,0) to (0,1)
- From (0,1) to (1,1)
- From (1,1) to (1,0)
- From (1,0) to (2,0)
- From (2,0) to (3,0)
- From (3,0) to (3,1)
- From (3,1) to (3,2)
- From (3,2) to (3,3)

Thus, the solution for the maze is represented as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
