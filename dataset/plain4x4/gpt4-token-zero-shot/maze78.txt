To solve the maze and find a path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (3,3), we treat the adjacency list provided as a graph, where each pair of connected nodes (cells) indicates possible movement between them.

From the adjacency list:
- Starting at (0,0), we see it's connected to (0,1) and (1,0).
- Continuing from (0,1), it connects to (0,0) and (1,1).
- Each step follows by checking each node's adjacent nodes and determining if it's closer to the exit.

Solving this systematically, tracing back which options continue to move to adjacent nodes and ultimately reach (3,3), I found a possible path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path directly traverses the grid from the start to the end, navigating through adjacent nodes listed in the adjacency list.
