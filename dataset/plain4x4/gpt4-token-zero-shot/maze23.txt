To find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3) in the maze represented by the adjacency list, we can utilize a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) method. Here, the adjacency list shows all the directly connected pairs of coordinates, allowing traversal between them if they share an edge.

Let's manually trace possible paths from the entry to the exit:

Starting from (0,0) which connects to (1,0).
From (1,0) we can move to (1,1).
From (1,1) we can move next to (2,1).
From (2,1), the next connected node can be (3,1).
Then, (3,1) can connect to (3,2).
From (3,2) move to (3,3) which is the exit.

Hence, the path from the entry (0,0) to the exit (3,3) is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution provides a direct path based on the adjacency relationships given, leading from the specified entry point to the exit efficiently.
