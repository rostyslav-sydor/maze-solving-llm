To solve the given maze, we construct a graph from the adjacency list and then find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

Let's begin.

First, interpret the adjacency list:
- Build the graph where each node represents a coordinate pair, and edges link directly connected nodes.
  
Using BFS:
- Start at (0,0).
- Visit all directly connected nodes; from (0,0) you can go to (1,0).
- Then from (1,0), continue to (1,1) following the graph's connections.
- Continue this until reaching (3,3) or exhaust all paths.

Now calculate the shortest path using the adjacency list:
1. Start at (0,0), move to (1,0) because they are directly connected.
2. Next, (1,0) connects to (1,1), then (1,1) to (1,2).
3. (1,2) connects to both (0,2) and (2,2), but moving towards (2,2) is directionally closer to (3,3).
4. Then (2,2) to (2,3), (2,3) to (3,3) through (1,3) and (3,2).

Combining these connections gives us the shortest path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path efficiently moves from origin to destination using the available connections.
