To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Analyzing the adjacency list given:
- From (0,0), we can go to (0,1).
- From (0,1), we can go to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can go to (0,3).
- From (0,3), we can move to (1,3).

Continuing this process by looking ahead:
- From (1,3), next is (2,3).
- From (2,3), proceed to (3,3), which is the exit.

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) follows the sequence of steps connecting these nodes as per the adjacency list.

Output this sequence with proper formatting:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
