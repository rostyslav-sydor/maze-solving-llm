To solve the maze and find a path between the given origin and target, we need to analyze the adjacency list provided:

1. Understand maze grid layout from adjacency list.
2. Start from the origin (0,0) and reach the target (3,3) using adjacent cell connections.
3. We can visualize or trace a path through connected nodes.

Starting from the entrance:
- From (0,0), you can move to (0,1) and then to (1,0) or simply directly to (1,0).
- From (1,0), proceed to (2,0), then to (2,1).
- From (2,1), move to (3,1), then from (3,1) to (3,2).
- At (3,2), go to (2,2), then get to (2,3).
- Finally from (2,3), move to (3,3) which is the exit.

Putting this in the required output format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
