Based on the adjacency list representing the maze, one possible path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path follows these steps:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0) as (1,0) is connected to (0,0).
3. Move to (2,0), which is adjacent to (1,0).
4. From (2,0) shift to (2,1) which is directly connected.
5. Continue up to (3,1) from (2,1).
6. Then proceed to (3,2) from (3,1).
7. Finally, reach the target (3,3) from (3,2).
