To solve this maze, we'll need to find a viable path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), using the adjacency list provided. Using a simple pathfinder like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search can be utilized to trace a path through the connections in the adjacency list.

Analyzing the adjacency list, we can create a map that depicts all possible connections from any node:

- From (0,0), the possible moves are to (0,1) and (1,0).
- From (0,1), we can move to (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1).
- From (1,0), possible moves include (0,0), (2,0).
- From (2,0), we can go to (1,0), (3,0).
- From (3,0), the path leads to (2,0), (3,1).
- From (3,1), possible destinations are (2,1), (3,0), (3,2).
- From (3,2), we can head to (3,1), (3,3).
  
Following these paths:
- Starting at (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

This route traverses vertically down the left side of the grid to the bottom, then proceeds horizontally across the bottom row and diagonally from bottom-left to top-right through column-wise movement in the third column.

Output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
