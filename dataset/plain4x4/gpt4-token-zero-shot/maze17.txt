To find a solution to the maze, we start by constructing the graph from the adjacency list provided in the query. Then, we use a search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to find a path from the origin to the target.

1. Construct the graph:
   - Nodes represent positions in the maze.
   - Edges connect directly adjoining positions that can be traveled between.

2. Define the entry (origin) and exit (target) points:
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

3. Implement BFS from the origin:
   - Visit each node and keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
   - Record the path taken to reach each node.

4. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded paths to reconstruct the route from the origin to the target.

5. Output the reconstructed path.

The result would look like this:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence navigates through the maze from the start point to the end point based on the adjacency list provided.
