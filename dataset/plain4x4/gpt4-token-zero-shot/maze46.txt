Based on the adjacency list given, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Parsing the list for connectivity between coordinates allows us to trace possible routes through the maze. 

1. Start from (0,0), adjacent to (1,0) by examining the list.
2. From (1,0), you can go to (0,0) or move to (1,1).
3. From (1,1), possible moves are (2,1) or back to (1,2).
4. Move from (1,1) to (2,1) (since the target in the third row).
5. (2,1) can lead to (2,2) or back to (1,1) or forward to (2,0).
6. From (2,0), move to (3,0).
7. (3,0) connects directly to (3,1).
8. Follow from (3,1) to (3,2).
9. From (3,2) you can progress to the target (3,3).

We conclude with the path: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
