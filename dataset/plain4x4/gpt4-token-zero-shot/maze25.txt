To find a solution to the presented maze, we need to interpret the adjacency list and then apply a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine the shortest path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

Here’s a summarized explanation of how we find the solution from the given adjacency list:

1. First, parse the adjacency list:
   - Each pair indicates direct connections or reachable points between coordinates.
  
2. Represent this list as a graph where each coordinate is a node and each connection (indicated by "<-->") is an edge.
  
3. Use the starting point (0,0) as the root node in your search algorithm:
   - If using BFS, we systematically explore level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the exit (3,3) is found first due to BFS's nature.
   - If using DFS, we try paths recursively changing direction upon reaching a dead end, until the exit is found.

4. Trace the path taken by the search algorithm from start to end, recording each step.

Based on this summary and applying the typical logic for BFS:
- Start from (0,0), visit all directly connected nodes.
- Each new level visited corresponds to nodes connected to the nodes you’ve already visited but not visited yet themselves.
- Continue until (3,3) is reached, which is the exit.

**Assuming BFS was used, the result might be the shortest path.**

Here's the possible solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is a plausible path through the maze given the connections in the adjacency list, leading from the entry point to the exit.
