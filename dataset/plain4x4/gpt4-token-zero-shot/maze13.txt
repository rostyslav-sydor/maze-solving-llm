To find a solution for the given maze, we need to traverse from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) using any viable path derived from the adjacency list provided.

1. Starting from (0,0), move to (1,0) as given in: (1,0) <--> (0,0)
2. From (1,0), proceed to (1,1) following: (2,1) <--> (1,1)
3. Next, move from (1,1) to (2,1) via: (3,1) <--> (2,1)
4. From (2,1) to (3,1) using: (3,1) <--> (2,1)
5. Then from (3,1) go to (3,2) following: (3,3) <--> (3,2)
6. Lastly, from (3,2) reach the target (3,3) as indicated: (3,3) <--> (3,2)

Thus, combining these movement decisions, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) is calculated.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of coordinates navigates successfully from the starting point to the end point in the maze using the adjacency list as connections between points.
