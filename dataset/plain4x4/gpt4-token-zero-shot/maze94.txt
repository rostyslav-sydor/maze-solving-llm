To solve the maze based on the adjacency list provided, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). Using the details of connectivity between nodes from the adjacency list:

1. Start at (0,0), the options from here are to go to (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move either back to (0,0) or forward to (2,0).
3. At (2,0), progress can be made towards (3,0) or back to (1,0).
4. From (3,0), there is only the backwards option towards (2,0).
5. So, staying on a potentially suitable path from (2,0), you can progress to (2,1).
6. From (2,1), you can access (3,1) or (2,2).
7. Choosing to go forward, (3,1) connects to (3,2).
8. From (3,2), possible moves include (3,3) or (2,2).
9. Finally, moving into (3,3) reaches the exit point.

Summarizing the sequence of moves taken, we create a path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence navigates through the maze from the origin to the target successfully, considering the connectivity outlined in the adjacency list.
