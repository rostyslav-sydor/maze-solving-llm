To find the solution to the maze represented as an adjacency list, we can employ a standard pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). To simplify the explanation, I will directly provide the resulting pathway from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) based on logical traversal through connected points:

After analyzing the adjacency list, the following path from start to end can be derived step-by-step:

1. Start at (0,0) where the adjacency list shows a connection to (0,1).
2. From (0,1) move to (1,1) as per adjacency list connectivity.
3. From (1,1) proceed to (2,1) which connects next to (2,2).
4. Follow from (2,2) to (2,3), moving from there to the final target (3,3), with a direct link from (2,3) to (3,3).

Thus, the sequence of moves in the maze from the entry to the exit point can be represented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This sequence uses connections provided in the adjacency list between respective nodes to successfully navigate from the start, (0,0), to the target, (3,3).
