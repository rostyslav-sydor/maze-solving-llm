To solve this maze, we first convert the adjacency list provided into a tool more amenable for pathfinding, like a graph data structure. Then, we can use a common graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) that will help us find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3).

Here is an outline of the solution:

1. Parse the adjacency list into a graph structure: 
    ```
    {
    (1,3): [(0,3), (1,2), (2,3)],
    (0,3): [(1,3)],
    (3,1): [(3,0), (3,2)],
    (3,0): [(3,1), (2,0)],
    (1,2): [(1,3), (0,2)],
    (3,3): [(3,2)],
    ...
    }
    ```

2. Use BFS starting from node (0,0):
    - Initialize a queue with the starting point and a set to track visited nodes.
    - Enqueue the initial node along with the path taken to reach it.
    - For each node, explore its neighbors if they have not been visited.
    - If the target node is reached, return the path.

3. Execute the algorithm and retrieve the path:
   ```
   Found Path: [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]
   ```

The solution path, represented step-by-step in terms of movement from the starting point (0,0) to the destination point (3,3), takes into account possible paths provided via connected nodes in the adjacency list.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This is just one of several potential paths through the maze that the BFS algorithm could output, depending on the order in which neighbors are checked and how the graph has been structured in memory.
