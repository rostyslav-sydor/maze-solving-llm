To find a solution to navigate through the maze from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we'll interpret the adjacency list and deduce the path.

Starting at (0,0), the list of adjacent coordinates provides possible moves:
- From (0,0) go to (0,1)
- From (0,1) go to (0,2)
- From (0,2) go to (0,3)
- From (0,3) go to (1,3)
- From (1,3) go to (2,3)
- Eventually from (2,3), reach (3,3)

Thus, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
