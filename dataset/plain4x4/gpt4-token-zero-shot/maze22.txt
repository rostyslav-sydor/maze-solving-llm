To find the solution to the maze described in the adjacency list, we will first identify the starting point (origin) and the end point (target) of the maze:

Origin: (0,0)
Target: (3,3)

Next, we will evaluate the connections from each point to determine a viable path from the origin to the target. Following is a breakdown of connections in a path:

1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Move to (0,1) - Connected to (0,0).
3. From (0,1) move to (0,2) - Connected to (0,1).
4. From (0,2), go to (1,2) - Connected to (0,2).
5. Move from (1,2) to (1,3) - Connected to (1,2).
6. Proceed from (1,3) to (2,3) - Connected to (1,3).
7. Finally, move from (2,3) to the target (3,3) - Connected to (2,3).

Now, presenting the step-by-step path from the origin to the target in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
