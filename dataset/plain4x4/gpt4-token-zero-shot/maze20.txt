To solve the maze presented, we can view it as finding a path in a graph where nodes represent coordinates in the maze, and edges represent possible movements between adjacent nodes. The adjacency list given provides information about these connected nodes, and the origin and target tokens mark the entry and exit points, respectively.

1. Begin at the origin point specified: (0,0).
2. Search through the adjacency list to find all nodes directly reachable from the current node and continue to the next in a systematic manner. We can apply a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm here, which is suitable for unweighted graphs like this maze to ensure the shortest path.
3. Traverse the graph using BFS until the target (3,3) is reached, maintaining a record of paths to backtrack the shortest route once the target is discovered.
4. Retrace the path from the target back to the origin, using the recorded steps.

Upon examining the adjacency list and following the above path searching mechanism, we can determine and list the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
