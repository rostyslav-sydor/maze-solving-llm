In order to find a path through the maze described by the adjacency list, we should use a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search). Each pair of coordinates in the adjacency list represents a bi-directional connection between nodes. The origin/start point is (0,0) and the target/exit point is (3,3).

First, we can visually reconstruct the adjacency relations into a grid maze:

    (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2) - (0,3)
      |               |
    (1,0)           (1,2) - (1,3)
      |               |       |
    (2,0) - (2,1) - (2,2) - (2,3)
      |                   |
    (3,0) - (3,1) - (3,2) - (3,3)

Using BFS, here is a likely path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0): 
2. Go to (0,1) 
3. Go to (0,2) -> (0,3)
4. Go straight down to (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This provides a direct path through the connections.

Therefore, the output, formatted according to your specifications, is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
