Given the adjacency list for the maze, we can determine the shortest path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3). Hereâ€™s how we analyze and solve the path:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Every coordinate pair (i.e., (0,0), (1,0), etc.) represents a vertex.
   - An edge exists between two vertices if they are directly connected, as indicated by the adjacency list (i.e., (3,3) <--> (2,3) means there is a direct path between (3,3) and (2,3)).

2. **Identifying the Entry and Exit Points**:
   - Origin: (0,0)
   - Target: (3,3)

3. **Connecting the Points**:
   - The adjacency list shows all direct connections between points, such as (0,0) directly connects to (1,0) and (0,1),
   - and so on.

4. **Practical Pathfinding**:
   By tracing paths via connected nodes:

   - Starting from (0,0):
     - Move to (0,1) - using connection "(0,0) <--> (0,1)"
     - Move to (0,2) - using connection "(0,1) <--> (0,2)"
     - Move to (0,3) - using connection "(0,2) <--> (0,3)"
     - Move to (1,3) - using connection "(0,3) <--> (1,3)"
     - Move to (1,2) - using connection "(1,3) <--> (1,2)"
     - Move to (2,2) - using connection "(1,2) <--> (2,2)"
     - Move to (2,3) - using connection "(2,2) <--> (2,3)"
     - Move to (3,3) - using connection "(2,3) <--> (3,3)", reaching the exit.

Provided data implies the least resistance forward/movement is lateral or up-down transitions reflecting common maze traversal rules. No circular paths are advised considering direct transitions are listed.

5. **Output Path**:
   <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This represents one possible shortest path solution based on the given maze's adjacency list configuration.
