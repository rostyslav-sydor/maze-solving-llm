To solve the maze, first decode the adjacency list into a graph structure. Begin at the origin (0,0) and aim to reach the target (3,3). Use a breadth-first search (BFS) method because it effectively finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph:

1. Initialize the BFS with the starting point, (0,0), and use a queue to manage the nodes to visit: [(0,0)].
2. Track the nodes that have been visited and also store the path to each node for backtracking. Visited = {(0,0): None}.
3. Expand BFS:
   - From (0,0) move to (0,1).
   - From (0,1) explore to (0,0) and (0,2).
   - From (0,2) explore to (0,1) and (0,3).
   - From (0,3) to (1,3).
   - Continue until reaching (3,3) or no more nodes to visit.
4. If (3,3) is reached, backtrack using the visited dictionary to trace the path.
5. The sequence from (0,0) to (3,3) via valid connections is formed.

From the adjacency list, a BFS approach will reveal the path as:
(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).

Formatted output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
