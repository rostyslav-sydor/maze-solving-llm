To solve the maze represented by the given adjacency list, we first identify the entry point (0,0) and the exit point (3,3). We will then navigate through the connected nodes until we find the path from the entry to the exit.

We begin at (0,0) and trace the path as follows:
1. Starting point is (0,0), which connects to (0,1).
2. Next, move from (0,1) to (0,2).
3. Move from (0,2) to (0,3).
4. Proceed from (0,3) to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), navigate to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), go to (1,1).
7. Progress further from (1,1) to (2,1).
8. Continue from (2,1) to (3,1).
9. From (3,1), head to (3,2).
10. From (3,2), go directly to (3,3), which is the exit.

Putting all the steps together:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This list represents the shortest trajectory, considering the adjacency connections provided, to navigate from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) in the maze.
