To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using the adjacency list provided. We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) as it is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Starting from (0,0), we can explore neighboring nodes till we reach (3,3). Using the adjacency list we can form connections as:

- From (0,0), we can go to (0,1)
- From (0,1), we can go to (0,2)
- From (0,2), we can go to (0,3)
- From (0,3), we can go to (1,3)
- From (1,3), we can go to (2,3)
- From (2,3), we can go to (3,3)

Now put these steps together to form the path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This sequence of moves solves the maze from the given entrance to the exit.
