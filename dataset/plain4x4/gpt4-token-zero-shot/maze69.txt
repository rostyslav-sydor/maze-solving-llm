To solve the maze, we first parse the given adjacency list to understand the connections between points.
  
Each pair of coordinates shows direct connectivity, thus creating a graph:
- (0,2) ↔ (1,2)
- (3,3) ↔ (3,2)
- (0,0) ↔ (0,1)
- (2,0) ↔ (1,0)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,2)
- (2,0) ↔ (3,0)
- (2,3) ↔ (1,3)
- (1,3) ↔ (0,3)
- (2,2) ↔ (2,1)
- (3,1) ↔ (3,0)
- (1,1) ↔ (2,1)
- (0,3) ↔ (0,2)
- (1,1) ↔ (1,2)
- (1,0) ↔ (0,0)
- (3,3) ↔ (2,3)

The origin point is (0,0) and the target point is (3,3), implying the need to explore paths from origin to target.

Applying a pathfinding algorithm like BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) helps us find the shortest route from (0,0) to (3,3):

1. Start at (0,0), which directly connects to (0,1).
2. Continue to (0,2) then (0,3).
3. Connected to (1,3), proceed to (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), and reach (2,2).
4. Advance to (2,3), then to (3,3).

Hence, the path through the maze from the start to the end point is:

<Path from (0,0) to (3,3)>:
<Path from (0,0)> to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and finally reaches (3,3). 

Note: The path can vary slightly depending on the algorithm and rules for traversal, but this is one possible solution path.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
