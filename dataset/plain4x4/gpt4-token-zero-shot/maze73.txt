To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list format, we'll systematically explore possible paths from the starting point (origin) (0,0) to the target (end) point (3,3) using the known edges between coordinates.

From the adjacency list, we can see that each coordinate is connected to its immediate neighbor either horizontally or vertically. To find a solution path, we can trace through connective entries in the list.

Starting at (0,0), possible movements based on the adjacency list can be traced as follows:

1. Begin at (0,0):
    - Connects directly to (1,0) and (0,1).

2. From (0,0) move to (1,0):
    - Connects to (0,0) and (2,0).

3. From (1,0) move to (2,0):
    - Connects to (3,0) and (1,0).

4. From (2,0) move to (3,0):
    - Connects to (3,1) and (2,0).

5. From (3,0) move to (3,1):
    - Connects to (3,0) and (2,1).

6. From (3,1) move to (2,1):
    - Connects to (2,2) and (3,1).

7. From (2,1) move to (2,2):
    - Connects to (3,2) and (2,1).

8. From (2,2) move to (3,2):
    - Connects to (3,3) and (2,2).

9. From (3,2) move to (3,3) (target point):
    - Connects to (3,3) and (3,2).

Thus, the solution path moving through coordinates is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path provides a direct route from the entry to the exit of the maze following valid connections between cells as noted in the adjacency list.
