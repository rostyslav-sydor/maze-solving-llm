To solve the maze given by the adjacency list, which describes the connectivity of each cell in a graph structure:

1. Parse the maze data between `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>` to understand the structure of the maze.
2. Identify the entry point from `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>`, which is (0,0).
3. Identify the exit point from `<TARGET_START>` and `<TARGET_END>`, which is (3,3).
4. Implement a search algorithm in the graph to find a path from the entry point to the exit point utilizing the connections defined by the adjacency list.
5. Since each connection is bidirectional (`<-->`), the graph is undirected.
6. The possible algorithms for this pathfinding are Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* (if heuristic is considered).

By following the BFS method (which is optimal for unweighted graphs like this one for shortest path finding):
 
- Start BFS from (0,0)
- Traverse through accessible connections based on adjacency definitions.
- Reach (3,3) while marking the visited paths.
- Trace back the path used to reach (3,3) from (0,0) from the visitation tracking.

Conclusively, abstracting from steps due to complexity and lack of algorithmic implementation here:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
