To solve the maze, I'll start by transforming the adjacency list into a more understandable form, identifying connections between each pair of nodes (coordinates):

- (3,1) <-> (3,0)
- (0,2) <-> (0,3)
- (3,3) <-> (3,2)
- (1,2) <-> (2,2)
- (2,1) <-> (3,1)
- (0,0) <-> (0,1)
- (1,2) <-> (0,2)
- (0,0) <-> (1,0)
- (1,0) <-> (1,1)
- (2,3) <-> (3,3)
- (2,1) <-> (2,0)
- (0,3) <-> (1,3)
- (3,1) <-> (3,2)
- (1,1) <-> (1,2)
- (1,3) <-> (2,3)

Entry point: (0,0)
Exit point: (3,3)

Using these connections, let's visualize the shortest possible path from the entry to the exit:

Start from (0,0):
1. Move to (0,1) - Following the edge (0,0) <-> (0,1)
2. Move to (1,0) - Connect from (0,0) to (1,0)
3. Progress to (1,1) - Through connection (1,0) <-> (1,1)
4. Move to (1,2) - Continuing to (1,1) <-> (1,2)
5. Navigate to (2,2) - Via (1,2) <-> (2,2)
6. Proceed to (3,2) - By connecting from (3,3) <-> (3,2) and (3,1) <-> (3,2)
7. Finally, reach (3,3) - From (3,2)

Here's the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
