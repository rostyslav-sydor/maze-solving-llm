To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, we first extract the connections and map out the graph, then find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3):

1. Firstly, represent the adjacency list as a usable graph structure:
   - (1,0) is connected to (2,0) and (1,1)
   - (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (0,3)
   - (2,3) is connected to (2,2) and (3,3)
   - (2,1) is connected to (2,2)
   - (1,1) is connected to (0,1)
   - (3,2) is connected to (3,3) and (3,1)
   - (2,2) is connected to (2,3) and (2,1)
   - (1,3) is connected to (0,3)
   - (0,1) is connected to (1,1), (0,0), and (0,2)
   - (3,1) is connected to (3,2) and (3,0)
   - (0,0) is connected to (0,1)
   - (3,0) is connected to (3,1) and (2,0)

2. Start at (0,0) and search for a path to (3,3), exploring reachable nodes while avoiding revisits.

3. The optimal path found:
   - Start at (0,0), move to (0,1), from there to (1,1), then to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), then upward to (3,1), (3,2), and finally (3,3).

Solution output:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This path navigates through the maze using accessible routes per the adjacency structure provided, leading from the origin to the target successfully.
