To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list and find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (3,3), we can apply a graph traversal technique like Breadth-First Search (BFS). Given the information in the adjacency list, here is how we outline the solution:

Entry Point: (0,0)
Exit Point: (3,3)

Adjacency List Graph:
- (0,0) connects to (1,0)
- (0,1) connects to (1,1)
- (0,2) connects to (0,3), (1,2)
- (0,3) connects to (1,3)
- (1,0) connects to (2,0)
- (1,1) connects to (2,1)
- (1,2) connects to (2,2)
- (1,3) connects only to (0,3)
- (2,0) connects to (2,1), (3,0)
- (2,1) connects to (1,1)
- (2,2) connects to (2,3)
- (2,3) connects to (3,3)
- (3,0) connects to (3,1)
- (3,1) connects to (3,2)
- (3,2) connects to (3,3)
- (3,3) is the exit, connecting to (3,2)

Using BFS starting from (0,0), the path to (3,3) would be determined:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This solution uses the BFS to navigate through connected nodes starting from (0,0) ensuring every move is valid based on the given adjacency list until it reaches (3,3).
