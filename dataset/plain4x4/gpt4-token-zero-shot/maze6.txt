To solve the maze described by your adjacency list, we start by constructing a graph from the list. Then, apply a breadth-first search (BFS) pathfinding algorithm, beginning at the origin point (0,0) to reach the target point (3,3).

**Graph Construction:**
The list contains pairs representing edges of directly connected nodes:
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- ...
- (3,1) <--> (2,1)

**Pathfinding (BFS):**
Starting from (0,0), we explore all neighboring nodes, then their neighbors, and so on, until we reach the destination node (3,3).

**Result Path:**
Performing BFS on the adjacency list, we find that the shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) through the nodes follows these coordinates:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Output this path enclosed within specified tokens:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
