First, let's map out the connections in the adjacency list:

1. (1,1) to (1,0)
2. (3,1) to (3,2)
3. (2,0) to (3,0)
4. (1,2) to (1,1)
5. (0,0) to (1,0)
6. (2,3) to (3,3)
7. (0,3) to (1,3)
8. (2,2) to (2,3)
9. (0,0) to (0,1)
10. (3,1) to (2,1)
11. (2,2) to (1,2)
12. (0,3) to (0,2)
13. (2,3) to (1,3)
14. (3,3) to (3,2)
15. (2,0) to (2,1)

Next, identify the entry and exit points:
- Entry: (0,0)
- Exit: (3,3)

Let's find a path:
1. From the origin (0,0), we can go to (1,0) based on connection 5.
2. From (1,0), move to (1,1) using connection 1.
3. From (1,1), move to (1,2) using connection 4.
4. From (1,2), move to (2,2) using connection 11.
5. From (2,2), proceed to (2,3) using connection 8.
6. From (2,3), head to (3,3) using connection 6.

Combining these, we get:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
