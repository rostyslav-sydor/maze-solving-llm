To solve the maze, we first need to construct the graph from the adjacency list provided and then find the shortest path from the entry to the exit.

The graph adjacency list shows the direct connections between nodes (each node represents a coordinate in the maze):

- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,2)
- (3,1) <--> (3,0)
- (1,0) <--> (0,0)
- (1,2) <--> (0,2)
- (1,1) <--> (1,2)
- (3,3) <--> (2,3)
- (1,1) <--> (1,0)
- (3,2) <--> (3,3)
- (2,2) <--> (2,1)
- (0,1) <--> (0,0)
- (1,3) <--> (2,3)
- (3,0) <--> (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> (2,1)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2)

The origin is (0,0) and the target is (3,3).

Using a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's, we can find a path from the origin to the target. Assuming an optimal path is found via such an algorithm:

The shortest path, considering all the possible moves defined by the adjacency list from (0,0) to (3,3), could look like:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path transitions through connected nodes, moving vertically up through column 3 and making horizontal moves when necessary.
