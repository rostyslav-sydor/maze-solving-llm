To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format provided, we need to find the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). 

Firstly, let's gather the edges of the graph based on the adjacency list: 
- (0,0) is connected to (1,0) and (0,1)
- (1,0) is connected to (0,0) and (1,1)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,0) and (0,2)
- (1,1) is connected to (1,0) and (2,1)
- (0,2) is connected to (0,1) and (0,3)
- (2,1) is connected to (1,1) and (3,1)
- and so on.

Using these connections, apply a shortest path finding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). 

Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS would explore all possible paths and nodes. We would check adjacent nodes or coordinates and keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops.

After implementing BFS, we find this shortest path from the origin to the target:
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

This path is then formatted between the required tokens:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
