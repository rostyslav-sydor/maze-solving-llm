To solve the maze presented as an adjacency list and find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3), we can approach it by visualizing or processing the connections (edges between nodes) and employing a search algorithm to navigate through the maze.

- **Maze Setup:** You provided various connections as adjacency pairs which link different points in a maze grid. For instance, (3,2) linked to (3,1) means there is a direct path between these two points in the maze.

- **Origin & Target Points:** The origin where the path starts is (0,0) and the target endpoint is (3,3).

Given this setup, the goal is to find a route from (0,0) to (3,3) traversing through connected nodes based on your adjacency list.

- **Strategy:**
    1. Use a graph traversal method like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the nodes.
    2. Start from the origin, explore adjacent nodes, check their connectivity based on the adjacency list, and track the path taken.
    3. Stop when the target node is reached.

Implementing BFS, for example, considering the maze structure and connections:

- Start at (0,0)
- From each node, explore adjacent nodes as per the list.
- Mark visited nodes to avoid loops and record the navigation path.
- When (3,3) is reached, trace back the path to (0,0) using recorded steps.

**Path Finding Result:**
Starting BFS from (0,0), following possible routes as guided by connections, and reaching (3,3):

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
``` 

This path navigates through permissible passages as per the given adjacency relationships and connects the origin to the target effectively.
