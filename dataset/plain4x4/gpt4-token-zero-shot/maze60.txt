To find a solution for the maze provided, I'll start deciphering the adjacency list, identify connections between points, and then calculate a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (3,3).

**Step 1: Understanding the adjacency list**
- Nodes and their connected nodes are given. For example, (0,0) <--> (0,1) means (0,0) is connected to (0,1).

**Step 2: Determining a Path**
- From (0,0), we can go to (0,1).
- From (0,1), we can go to (1,1).
- From (1,1), we can move to (2,1).
- From (2,1), we can move to (1,1) or (2,2). Here (2,2) moves us closer to the target.
- From (2,2), progress to (2,3).
- From (2,3), move to (3,3).

This path ensures continuity and connectedness without revisiting any point unnecessarily.

**Solution Representation:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
