The task is to find a path from the maze's entry point (0,0) to its exit point (3,3). First, letâ€™s convert the adjacency list provided between the <ADJLIST_START> and <ADJLIST_END> into a usable graph format.

Using a breadth-first search (BFS), a popular graph traversal method, we explore each vertex starting from the entry point following the connections defined:

1. Begin at (0,0), the start point.
2. Explore the neighbors of (0,0), which are (1,0), and (0,1).
3. From (0,1), explore its neighbors which are (1,1).
4. From (1,1), its neighbor (2,1) can be explored further.
5. Continue the exploration from (2,1) to neighbors (2,2).
6. From (2,2), explore to (3,2).
7. Continue from (3,2) to (3,3), the target.

The path we traced thus provides us with:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>

This path effectively follows a sequence of valid moves through the graph, connecting the defined entry and exit points by navigating through connected coordinates, ensuring each step is to an adjacent node as per the adjacency list.
