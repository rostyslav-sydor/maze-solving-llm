First, let's create a visual representation of the maze using the adjacency list provided. We'll then trace the optimal path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3) using a shortest path algorithm. 

Given the maze connectivity:
- (3,2) <--> (3,1)
- ... (rest connections as provided)

Here is how the adjacency connections would look:  

(0,0) is connected to (0,1)
(0,1) is connected to (1,1), and (0,0)
(0,2) is connected to (1,2)
(0,3) is connected to (1,3)
(1,0) is connected to (1,1), (2,0)
(1,1) is connected to (0,1), (1,0), (2,1)
... (rest in similar detailed mapping)

Origin is (0,0) and Target is (3,3). Using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy:

- Start from (0,0), next possible moves to (0,1).
- From (0,1) move to (1,1).
- Move from (1,1) to (2,1).
- Then move to (2,2).
- From (2,2) proceed to (2,3).
- Move upward from (2,3) to (3,3), the exit.

Thus, the shortest path obtained is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
