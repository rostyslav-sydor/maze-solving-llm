To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (3,3). Here is the solution to navigate through the maze:


1. Starting at (0,0), the only adjacent node is (0,1).
2. From (0,1), proceed to (0,2).
3. Next, from (0,2), go to either (0,3) or (1,2) - choose (1,2) to move closer to the target.
4. From (1,2), continue to (1,3).
5. Then move from (1,3) to (2,3).
6. From (2,3), the final step is to proceed to (3,3).

This constitutes a valid path from the origin to the target. Thus, the path coordinates in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

This solution efficiently utilizes the connections available in the given maze structure to reach the destination.
