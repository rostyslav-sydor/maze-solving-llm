To solve the maze given in the question, we need to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (3,3) based on the adjacency list provided.

Let's construct the possible movements in the maze:

1. Start at (0,0):
   - Move to (1,0) - as adjacency (1,0) <--> (0,0) exists.

2. From (1,0):
   - Move to (2,0) - adjacency (1,0) <--> (2,0) exists.

3. From (2,0):
   - Move to (2,1) - adjacency (2,0) <--> (2,1) exists.

4. From (2,1):
   - Move to (3,1) - adjacency (2,1) <--> (3,1) exists.

5. From (3,1):
   - Move to (3,2) - adjacency (3,1) <--> (3,2) exists.

6. From (3,2):
   - Move to (3,3) - adjacency (3,3) <--> (3,2) exists.

Now, reconstructing the entire path from (0,0) to (3,3) based on the movements:

<Path_start> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <Path_end>

This is one possible solution to navigate through the maze using the adjacency list provided.
