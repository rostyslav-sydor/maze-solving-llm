Given the adjacency list in the maze description and the stated starting point (0,0) and ending point (3,3), we need to find a path from the origin to the target.

First, let's visualize the connections:

- (0,0) links to (1,0) and (0,1).
- (1,0) links to (2,0).
- (2,0) links to (3,0).
- (3,0) links to (3,1).
- (0,1) links to (0,2).
- (0,2) links to (0,3) and (1,2).
- (0,3) links to (1,3).
- (1,1) links to (1,2).
- (1,2) links to (2,2).
- (1,3) links to (2,3).
- (2,1) links to (2,2).
- (2,2) links to (2,3).
- (2,3) links to (3,3).
- (3,1) links to (3,2).
- (3,2) links to (3,3).

Using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) method, starting from (0,0), we can determine an appropriate path. Following the BFS method for more direct routes:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to (1,0).
3. Proceed to (2,0).
4. Go to (3,0).
5. Continue to (3,1).
6. Move to (3,2).
7. Reach final destination (3,3).

Thus, the path in proper format is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
