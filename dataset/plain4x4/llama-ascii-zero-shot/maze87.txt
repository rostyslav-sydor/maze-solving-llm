I understand. Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the entry point (1,1) and ends at the exit point (7,7). The walls are marked with hash signs, and the path avoids them by following the available routes.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
