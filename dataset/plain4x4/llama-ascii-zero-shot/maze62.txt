I understand. Here is the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (5,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start at coordinate (1,1) and move right to coordinate (1,2).
2. Move down to coordinate (1,3).
3. Move right to coordinate (2,3).
4. Move down to coordinate (2,4).
5. Move right to coordinate (3,4).
6. Move down to coordinate (3,5).
7. Move right to coordinate (4,5).
8. Move down to coordinate (4,6).
9. Move right to coordinate (5,6).
10. Move down to coordinate (5,7), which is the exit point.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
