I understand. Here's the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) <PATH_END>

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

1. Start at coordinate (1,1) (Letter S).
2. Move right to coordinate (1,2) because there is no wall to the right.
3. Move down to coordinate (1,3) because there is no wall below.
4. Move right to coordinate (2,3) because there is no wall to the right.
5. Move down to coordinate (2,4) because there is no wall below.
6. Move right to coordinate (3,4) because there is no wall to the right.
7. Move down to coordinate (3,5) because there is no wall below.
8. Move right to coordinate (4,5) because there is no wall to the right.
9. Move down to coordinate (4,6) because there is no wall below.
10. Move right to coordinate (5,6) because there is no wall to the right.
11. Move down to coordinate (5,7) because there is no wall below.
12. End at coordinate (5,7) (Letter E).

Please note that this solution assumes that the maze is solvable and that there are no dead ends or loops. If the maze has any of these features, the solution may be different.
