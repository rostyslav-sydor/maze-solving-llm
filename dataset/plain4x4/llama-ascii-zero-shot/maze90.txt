I understand. Here is the solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (5,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Please note that the path is not unique and there may be other solutions for the same maze.
