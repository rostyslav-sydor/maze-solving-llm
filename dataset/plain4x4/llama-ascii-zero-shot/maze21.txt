I understand. Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the entry point (1,1) and ends at the exit point (7,7). The walls are marked with hash signs, and the path avoids them by following the available routes.

Please note that the path is not the only solution, and there may be other ways to solve the maze.
