I understand. Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (2,1) (3,3) (3,2) (3,1) <PATH_END>

Please note that the path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). Walls are marked with hash signs in the ASCII representation.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain the solution in more detail.
