I understand. Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) (5,5) (5,6) (6,6) (6,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (6,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. Start at coordinate (1,1) and move right to coordinate (1,2).
2. Move down to coordinate (2,2).
3. Move right to coordinate (2,3).
4. Move down to coordinate (3,3).
5. Move right to coordinate (3,4).
6. Move down to coordinate (4,4).
7. Move right to coordinate (4,5).
8. Move down to coordinate (5,5).
9. Move right to coordinate (5,6).
10. Move down to coordinate (6,6).
11. Move right to coordinate (6,7) and reach the exit point.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
