I understand. Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) <PATH_END>

Please note that the path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
