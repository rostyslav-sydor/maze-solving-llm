I understand. Here is the solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) <PATH_END>

The path starts at the entry point (1,1) and ends at the exit point (7,7). The walls are marked with hash signs, and the path avoids them by following the available routes.

Please note that there are multiple solutions for mazes, and this is just one possible solution.
