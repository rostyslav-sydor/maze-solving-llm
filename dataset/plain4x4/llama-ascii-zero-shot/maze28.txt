I understand. Here's the solution to the maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (5,4) (5,5) (6,5) (6,6) (7,6) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
