Since the representation of the maze is given as an adjacency list for a graph, it's possible to solve it using a graph search algorithm like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). Here's how the maze can be solved using BFS:  

1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and add it to the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty:
3.    Remove the first element from the queue and mark it as visited.
4.    If the removed element is the target point (3,3), then the path has been found and the algorithm stops.
5.    Otherwise, iterate over the neighbors of the removed element and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.
6.    Repeat steps 2-5 until the target point is found or the queue is empty.

The path from the origin to the target point can be reconstructed by storing the parent of each visited node in a dictionary. Once the target point is reached, the path can be obtained by backtracking from the target point to the origin point using the stored parents.  

Here's the solution path for the given maze: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
