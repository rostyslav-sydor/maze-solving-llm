1. **Identify the starting and ending points:** The starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (3,3).

2. **Start from the starting point and explore the maze:** From (0,0), we can move to (0,1), (1,0), or (3,0). Let's explore the path (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (3,3).

3. **Check if the path is valid:** We need to ensure that each step in the path is a valid move in the maze. In this case, all the moves are valid.

4. **Output the solution:** The solution path is <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
