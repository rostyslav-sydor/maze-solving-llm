1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore all adjacent unvisited points and mark them as visited.
3. Keep exploring until the target point (3,3) is reached.
4. Backtrack from the target point to the origin point, marking the path as the solution.

Solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
