1. Start at the origin (0,0) and follow the path until you reach the target (3,3).
2. At each intersection, choose the path that leads to the target.
3. If you reach a dead end, backtrack to the last intersection and try a different path.

Here is the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
