1. Locate the starting point (0,0) and ending point (3,3) in the adjacency list.

2. Identify the path from the starting point to the ending point by following the connections between the nodes.

3. The path is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

4. Output the path in the specified format: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
