**Step 1: Identify the starting and ending points**
<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

**Step 2: Perform a Depth First Search (DFS)**

**Stack:** [(0,0)]
**Visited:** [(0,0)]

**While stack is not empty:**
Pop the top of the stack and assign it to current_node (0,0)
If current_node is the ending point (3,3), then a solution is found.
Push all unvisited neighbors of current_node onto the stack.
Mark current_node as visited.

**Step 3: Trace the path**

Starting from the ending point (3,3), backtrack through the visited nodes to the starting point (0,0) to obtain the path:

<PATH_START> (3,3) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (0,2) (0,1) (0,0) <PATH_END>
