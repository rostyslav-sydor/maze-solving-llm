1. Start from the origin coordinate (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore all adjacent coordinates of the current coordinate.
3. If an adjacent coordinate is the target coordinate, then stop and output the path.
4. Otherwise, if an adjacent coordinate is not visited and is not an obstacle, then mark it as visited and add it to the queue.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target coordinate is reached or the queue is empty.

The solution path for the given maze is:
<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
