1. We start at the origin (0,0) and add it to the path.
2. We check the adjacent cells and find that we can move to (0,1) or (1,0).
3. We add (1,0) to the path and check its adjacent cells. We can move to (1,1) or (2,0).
4. We add (1,1) to the path and check its adjacent cells. We can move to (1,2) or (2,1).
5. We add (1,2) to the path and check its adjacent cells. We can move to (1,3) or (2,2).
6. We add (1,3) to the path and check its adjacent cells. We can move to (2,3) or (3,3).
7. We add (2,3) to the path and check its adjacent cells. We can move to (3,3), which is the target.
8. We add (3,3) to the path and stop.

The path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
