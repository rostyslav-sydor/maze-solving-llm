1. **Identify the starting and ending points:** The starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (3,3).
2. **Create a queue and enqueue the starting point:** We start by enqueuing the starting point (0,0) into a queue.
3. **While the queue is not empty:**
    - Dequeue the first element from the queue.
    - Mark the dequeued element as visited.
    - Check if the dequeued element is the ending point. If it is, we have found a path.
    - Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued element into the queue.
4. **If the ending point is not found after processing all the elements in the queue, there is no path.**

In this case, we can find a path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
