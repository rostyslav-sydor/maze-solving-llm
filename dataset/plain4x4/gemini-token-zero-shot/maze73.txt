1. **Identify starting and ending points**

<PATH_START> (0,0) <PATH_END>

2. **Traverse the maze using a breadth-first search**

Start from the starting point and add it to a queue.
While the queue is not empty, remove the first element, check its adjacent elements, and add them to the queue if they have not been visited before.
Repeat until the target point is found.

3. **Backtrack to find the path**

Once the target point is found, backtrack through the parent pointers to find the path taken.
Start from the target point and follow the parent pointers until the starting point is reached.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
