1. Create a graph from the adjacency list.
2. Find the shortest path from the start node to the target node using a graph search algorithm such as breadth-first search or Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Convert the path to a list of coordinates.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
