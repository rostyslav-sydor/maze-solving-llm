1. Start from the origin (0,0) and add it to the path.
2. Check the adjacent nodes of (0,0) and add (0,1) to the path as it leads to the target.
3. Continue checking the adjacent nodes of (0,1) and add (0,2) to the path as it leads to the target.
4. Repeat step 3 until you reach the target node (3,3).
5. The final path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
