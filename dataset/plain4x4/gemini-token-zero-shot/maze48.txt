1. Start from the origin point `(0, 0)`, which is marked with `<ORIGIN_START>` token.

2. Explore all the adjacent points from the current point, which are `(0, 1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(3, 0)`.

3. Among these adjacent points, choose the one that leads towards the target point `(3, 3)`, which is `(3, 0)` in this case.

4. Move to the chosen point `(3, 0)` and repeat the exploration and selection process.

5. Continue this process until the target point `(3, 3)` is reached.

The resulting path would be:

`<PATH_START> (0, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) <PATH_END>`
