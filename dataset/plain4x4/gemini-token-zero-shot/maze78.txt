1. The maze can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms.
2. We start from the origin and explore the adjacent nodes until we reach the target.
3. In this case, we can use DFS to solve the maze.
4. The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
