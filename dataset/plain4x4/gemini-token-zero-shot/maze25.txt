To find a solution to the maze, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. We start at the origin and recursively explore all possible paths until we reach the target. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and explore another path.

Here is a solution to the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
