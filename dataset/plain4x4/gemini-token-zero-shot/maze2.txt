Identify the origin and target coordinates:

**Origin**: (0, 0)
**Target**: (3, 3)

From the origin, explore all adjacent coordinates and recursively perform the same operation until the target coordinate is reached.

Here's a possible solution path:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 3) --> (2, 3) --> (3, 3) <PATH_END>

This path starts from the origin, moves right, then up, and continues to follow the right-hand wall until reaching the target.
