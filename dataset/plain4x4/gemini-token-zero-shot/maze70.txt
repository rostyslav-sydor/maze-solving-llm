1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, where each vertex is a coordinate (row, column) and each edge is a connection between two vertices.

2. The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).

3. We start at the entry point and explore the maze using depth-first search (DFS).

4. We mark each vertex as visited to avoid loops.

5. When we reach the exit point, we backtrack to find the path from the entry point to the exit point.

6. The path is a list of coordinates that we visited in order from the entry point to the exit point.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
