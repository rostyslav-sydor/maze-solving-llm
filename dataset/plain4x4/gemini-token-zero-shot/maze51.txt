1. First, we need to find the starting point, which is marked with the <ORIGIN_START> token. In this case, the starting point is (0,0).

2. Then, we can start traversing the maze by following the edges in the adjacency list. For example, from (0,0) we can go to (1,0), (0,1), or (0,3).

3. We can keep track of our path by storing the coordinates of each node we visit.

4. We continue traversing the maze until we reach the ending point, which is marked with the <TARGET_END> token.

5. Once we have found the ending point, we can output the path we took to get there.

Here is the path from (0,0) to (3,3):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
