1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list. We can use a graph search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), to find a path from the entry point to the exit point.

2. We start at the entry point and visit all its neighbors. We mark each neighbor as visited and add it to a queue.

3. We then visit the first neighbor in the queue and repeat the process until we reach the exit point.

4. The path from the entry point to the exit point is the sequence of nodes that we visited during the BFS.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
