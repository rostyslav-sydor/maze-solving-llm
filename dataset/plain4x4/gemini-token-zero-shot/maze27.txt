1. Starting at the origin point at coordinate (0,0) move towards possible next coordinates according to the adjaceny list, which are (0,1) and (1,0)
2. From (0,1) we can move forward to (0,2) and from (1,0) to (2,0) 
3. We reach the next possible point to (2,0), so we backtrack to (1,0) and try moving to the other adjacent coordinate we haven't tried, which is (0,1).
4. Now we try moving towards (1,1), and since there are no other available coordinates to move forward to, we now have to try moving down to (0,1)
5. From (0,1) we go to (0,2), and now we can move to the right to (1,2) because according to the list, (1,2) is reachable from (0,2) and we have not visited (1,2).
6. From (1,2) we can go to (1,3) and (2,2), and since we have already visited (2,2), we move forward to (1,3).
7. Next possible coordinates are (1,2) and (0,3), which we have already visited, therefor we backtrack to (1,1).
8. From (1,1) we have already visited other possible coordinates, so we backtrack again to (0,2).
9. From (0,2) we move back to (0,1).
10. Now the only path forward is (1,1) and since we have reach this point from (1,0) we move back to (1,0).
11. At (1,0) we have visited all viable paths, therefor we backtrack to (0,0).
12. We have reached a dead end, therefor the solution path does not exist.
