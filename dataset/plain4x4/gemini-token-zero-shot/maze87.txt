1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, where each entry lists the adjacent nodes to a particular node.
2. The entry and exit points are marked with special tokens (<ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END>).
3. The goal is to find a path from the entry point to the exit point.
4. To do this, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
5. Starting from the entry point, we recursively visit all adjacent nodes, marking each node as visited.
6. If we reach the exit point, we have found a path.
7. If we reach a dead end (i.e., a node with no unvisited adjacent nodes), we backtrack to the last node that we visited.
8. We continue this process until we either find a path to the exit point or we have visited all possible paths.

The path found in the given maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
