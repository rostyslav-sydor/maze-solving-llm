1. The maze can be represented as a graph with tokens as vertices and connections as edges.
2. The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).
3. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point.
4. The BFS algorithm starts at the entry point and explores all of its neighbors.
5. It then explores all of the neighbors of its neighbors, and so on.
6. The algorithm stops when it reaches the exit point.
7. The shortest path is the path from the entry point to the exit point that has the fewest edges.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
