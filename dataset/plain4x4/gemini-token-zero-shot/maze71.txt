1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, where each entry represents a node in the maze and the list of nodes that are connected to it.
2. The starting and ending points are marked with <ORIGIN_START/END> and <TARGET_START/END> tokens respectively.
3. To find a solution for the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
4. Starting from the origin, we can recursively explore all the nodes that are connected to it, until we reach the target.
5. The solution for the maze is the sequence of nodes that we visited during the DFS.
6. In this case, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
