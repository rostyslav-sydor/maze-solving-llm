1. We start at the origin point <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and follow the path defined by the adjacency list until we reach the target point <TARGET_START> (3,3).

2. The first entry in the adjacency list, (1,2) <--> (1,3), tells us that we can move from the origin point (0,0) to either (1,2) or (1,3).

3. We choose to move to (1,2) and follow the adjacency list again. 

4. From (1,2), we can move to either (0,2) or (2,2).

5. We choose to move to (2,2) and then to (3,2), which leads us to the target point (3,3).

6. The path from the origin to the target is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
