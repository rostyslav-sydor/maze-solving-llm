1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, where each node is a tuple (row, column) and each edge is a tuple of two nodes.

2. The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).

3. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point.

4. We start by adding the entry point to a queue and marking it as visited.

5. We then loop through the queue and for each node in the queue, we add all of its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.

6. We continue looping through the queue until we reach the exit point.

7. The shortest path from the entry point to the exit point is the sequence of nodes that we visited in order.

Here is the solution to the maze in the format of a coordinate list:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
