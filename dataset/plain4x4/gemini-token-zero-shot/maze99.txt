Since the input graph is not connected, we need to find the path from the origin to the exit separately for each connected component.
First, let's find the connected component of the origin. It consists of the following nodes:
- (0,0)
- (1,0)
- (0,1)
- (1,1)
- (0,2)
- (3,2)
- (2,2)
- (1,2)
- (2,3)
- (3,3)
Next, let's find the connected component of the exit. It consists of the following nodes:
- (3,0)
- (3,1)
Since the origin and the exit are in different connected components, there is no path between them. Therefore, the output should be:
<PATH_START> <PATH_END>
