1. Convert adjacency list to a more structured data representation, for example a matrix where each cell contains the possible adjacent tokens.
2. Find the position of the origin and target tokens in the matrix.
3. Initialize a queue with the origin token and iterate until the queue is empty:
- Dequeue the first token from the queue.
- If the dequeued token is the target token, break the loop, the solution is found.
- If the dequeued token is not the target token, add all adjacent tokens to the queue, which were not previously visited.
4. Backtrack the solution by following the parents of each token, starting from the target token to the origin token.
