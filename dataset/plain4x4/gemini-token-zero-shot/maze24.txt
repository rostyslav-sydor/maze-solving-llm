1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the origin point.
2. While the queue is not empty:
3. Dequeue the first point from the queue.
4. If the dequeued point is the target point, return the solution path.
5. For each neighbor of the dequeued point:
6. If the neighbor has not been visited yet, enqueue it and add the current point to its path.

The solution path for the given maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
