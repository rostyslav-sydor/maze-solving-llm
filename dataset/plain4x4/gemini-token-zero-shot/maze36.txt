1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and find all the adjacent points.
2. Check if any of the adjacent points is the target point (3,3).
3. If not, then recursively call the function for each of the adjacent points.
4. If any of the recursive calls return a solution, then return that solution.
5. If none of the recursive calls return a solution, then backtrack and try a different adjacent point.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a solution is found or all the adjacent points have been explored.

The solution for the given maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
