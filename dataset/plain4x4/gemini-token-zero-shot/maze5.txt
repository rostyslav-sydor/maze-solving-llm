1. **Identify the starting point**: (0,0).
2. **Identify the ending point**: (3,3).
3. **Perform a breadth-first search**: Starting from the starting point, systematically explore all adjacent nodes until reaching the ending point.
4. **Trace the path back**: Once the ending point is reached, trace the path back to the starting point by recording the coordinates visited along the way.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
