1. Parse adjacency list to build graph representation of maze.
2. Perform BFS from starting position (0,0).
3. While performing the breadth-first search keep track of the parent node for each node.
4. Back-trace from target node to starting position by following the parent nodes to construct path.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
