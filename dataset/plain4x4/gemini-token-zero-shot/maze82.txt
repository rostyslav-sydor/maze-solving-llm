We can use depth first search (DFS) to find the path between the origin and target points:
1. Starting at the origin point, (0, 0), we push it into a stack and mark it as visited.
2. While the stack is not empty, we pop the top element, which is (0,0).
3. We check all the adjacent points of (0,0) and find that only (1,0) is not visited. We push (1,0) into the stack and mark it as visited.
4. We repeat step 2 and step 3 until we reach the target point, (3,3).
5. The path from the origin to the target point is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
