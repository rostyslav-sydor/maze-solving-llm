1. Starting from origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0), move to (0,1) as per adjacency list.
2. From (0,1), move to (0,2) as per adjacency list.
3. From (0,2), move to (1,2) as per adjacency list.
4. From (1,2), move to (2,2) as per adjacency list.
5. From (2,2), move to (3,2) as per adjacency list.
6. From (3,2), move to (3,3) as per adjacency list, which is the target <TARGET_START> (3,3).

So, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
