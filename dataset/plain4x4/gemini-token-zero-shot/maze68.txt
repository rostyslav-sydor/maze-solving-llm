1. Find the origin and target coordinates from the maze description.
2. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the origin coordinate, marking visited coordinates to avoid loops.
3. While performing DFS, keep track of the path taken by storing the coordinates in a list.
4. Once the target coordinate is reached, the path list contains the solution.
5. Reverse the path list to get the path from origin to target.

Following the steps above, we get the following solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
