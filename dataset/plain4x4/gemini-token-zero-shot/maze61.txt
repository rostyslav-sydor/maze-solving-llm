1.  Identify the start and end points. In this case, the start point is (0,0) and the end point is (3,3).
2.  Use a depth-first search or breadth-first search to find a path from the start point to the end point.
3.  Output the path as a list of coordinates. In this case, the path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
