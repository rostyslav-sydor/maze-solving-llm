1. Start at the <ORIGIN_START> token, which is at (0,0).
2. Find all the adjacent nodes to (0,0) and choose the node that is closest to the <TARGET_END> token, which is (3,3).
3. The closest node to (3,3) is (1,1), so move to (1,1).
4. Repeat step 2 from (1,1) until you reach the <TARGET_END> token.
5. The path from <ORIGIN_START> to <TARGET_END> is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
