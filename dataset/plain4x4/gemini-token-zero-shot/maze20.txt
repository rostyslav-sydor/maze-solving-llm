1. Start at the origin (0,0) and move through the maze following the adjacencies.
2. At each step, check if the current position is the target (3,3).
3. If the current position is the target, stop and output the path taken.
4. If the current position is not the target, continue moving through the maze using the adjacencies.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target is reached or there are no more adjacencies to follow.

Following these steps, we can find the path from (0,0) to (3,3) as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
