1. Start from the origin point (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Find all adjacent nodes of (0,0) and check if they are visited.
3. If an adjacent node is not visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the queue is empty.
5. If the target point is not visited, there is no path between the origin and target points.
6. If the target point is visited, backtrack from the target point to the origin point to find the path.

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
