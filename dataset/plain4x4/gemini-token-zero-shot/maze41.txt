- Start from the origin (0,0) and add it to the path.
- From (0,0), we can move to either (0,1) or (1,0). Let's choose (0,1) and add it to the path.
- From (0,1), we can move to either (1,1) or (0,2). Let's choose (1,1) and add it to the path.
- From (1,1), we can move to either (1,2) or (2,1). Let's choose (1,2) and add it to the path.
- From (1,2), we can move to either (1,3) or (2,2). Let's choose (1,3) and add it to the path.
- From (1,3), we can move to either (2,3) or (0,3). Let's choose (2,3) and add it to the path.
- From (2,3), we can move to either (3,3) or (2,2). Let's choose (3,3) and add it to the path.
- We have reached the target (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
