1. Start at the origin (0,0) and move right to (1,0).
2. Move down to (1,1) and right to (2,1).
3. Move up to (1,1) and right to (2,1).
4. Move down to (2,2) and right to (3,2).
5. Move up to (2,3) and right to (3,3), the target.

Therefore, the solution is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
