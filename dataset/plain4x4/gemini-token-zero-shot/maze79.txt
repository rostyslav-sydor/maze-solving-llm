1. Find all paths from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3) using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms.

2. For each path, calculate its length, which is the number of edges in the path.

3. Find the path with the shortest length.

4. Output the path coordinates by extracting the coordinates of the edges in the shortest path.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
