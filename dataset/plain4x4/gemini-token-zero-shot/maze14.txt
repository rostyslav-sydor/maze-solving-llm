1. The starting point is <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and the ending point is <TARGET_END> (3,3).

2. Starting from the origin, we can move to the following adjacent points: (1,0), (0,1).

3. From (1,0), we can move to (2,0).

4. From (2,0), we can move to (2,1).

5. From (2,1), we can move to (3,1).

6. From (3,1), we can move to (3,2), (3,3).

7. Since (3,3) is the destination, the path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
