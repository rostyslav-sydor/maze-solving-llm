1. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, with each line representing an edge between two vertices.
2. The entry point is (0,0) and the exit point is (3,3).
3. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point.
4. The BFS algorithm will start at the entry point and explore all of its adjacent vertices.
5. It will then explore all of the adjacent vertices of those vertices, and so on, until it reaches the exit point.
6. The shortest path from the entry point to the exit point will be the path with the fewest edges.
7. The output of the BFS algorithm will be a list of the vertices in the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point.
8. We can format this list as a path string by removing the redundant coordinates and adding appropriate tokens <PATH_START> and <PATH_END> as follows: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
