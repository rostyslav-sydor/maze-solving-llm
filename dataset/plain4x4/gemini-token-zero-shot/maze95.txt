1. Start at the origin (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
2. Explore all unvisited neighbors of the current cell.
3. If any of the unvisited neighbors is the target, then the solution is found.
4. If none of the unvisited neighbors is the target, mark the current cell as visited and explore its unvisited neighbors.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until either the target is found or there are no more unvisited neighbors.
