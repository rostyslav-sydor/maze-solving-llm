**Reasoning:**

A maze can be regarded as a connected graph where each node represents a cell in the maze and each edge represents a possible path between two adjacent cells. To find a solution to a maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find a path from the start node to the end node.

**Solution for the specific maze:**

Starting from the origin cell (0,0), we can use a DFS algorithm to explore the maze and find a path to the target cell (3,3).

1. Start from the origin cell (0,0) and mark it as visited.
2. Check the adjacent cells of the current cell and see if any of them are unvisited.
3. If there are unvisited adjacent cells, choose one of them and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target cell (3,3) is reached.
5. Backtrack from the target cell to the origin cell to find the solution path.

**Path:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
