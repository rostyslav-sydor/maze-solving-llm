We need to find a path between two points in a graph.
For that we can use depth first search.
Let's start with breadth first search which is a special case of depth first search where we only search the next node if there is a path between current node and that node.

**Depth first search (DFS)**

1. Start at the entry point and mark it as visited.
2. Get the list of adjacent nodes.
3. For each adjacent node, if it is not visited, recursively call DFS on that node.
4. If there is no unvisited adjacent node, backtrack to the previous node.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the exit point is reached.

**Solution for the given maze:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
