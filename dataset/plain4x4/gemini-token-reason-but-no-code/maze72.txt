**Reasoning:**
We use breadth-first search algorithm to solve the maze. Starting from the origin, we add all reachable neighbors to a queue. Then, we dequeue the first element of the queue and add all its reachable neighbors to the queue. We repeat this process until we reach the target. The path from the origin to the target can be obtained by backtracking from the target to the origin.

**Solution:**
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
```
