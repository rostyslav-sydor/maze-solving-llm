**Reasoning**:

We can apply Depth-first search or Breadth-first search algorithms to find a path from the starting point to the target point in the maze. These algorithms will visit each node and its neighbors in depth or breadth, respectively, until the target is reached.

**Solution**:

We apply Depth-first search algorithm to the given maze:

- Start at the origin point (0,0).
- Visit its unvisited neighbor (0,1).
- Continue visiting unvisited neighbors until a dead end is reached.
- Backtrack to the most recent unvisited neighbor of the previous node.
- Repeat until the target point (3,3) is reached.

The resulting path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
