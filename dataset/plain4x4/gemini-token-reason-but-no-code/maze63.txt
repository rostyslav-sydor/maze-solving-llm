Since the graph is undirected and unweighted, we can use breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.
We start at the origin and add it to a queue.
Then, for each node in the queue, we add all of its neighbors to the queue, and mark them as visited.
We continue this process until we reach the target.
The path from the origin to the target is then the sequence of nodes that were visited.

In the given maze, the origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (3,3).
We start at the origin and add it to the queue.
The only neighbor of the origin is (0,1), so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
Next, we visit (0,1) and add its neighbors, (0,2) and (1,1), to the queue.
We continue this process until we reach the target, which is at (3,3).
The path from the origin to the target is then:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
