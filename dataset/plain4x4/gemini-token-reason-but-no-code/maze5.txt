This maze can be solved using a simple depth-first search algorithm. We start at the origin point (0,0) and explore all possible paths from there. If we reach the target point (3,3), then we have found a solution. Otherwise, we backtrack and explore a different path.

One possible solution to this maze is the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

In this path, we start at the origin point (0,0) and move one step to the right to reach (0,1). From there, we move one step up to reach (1,1). We then move one step to the right to reach (1,2) and then one step up to reach (1,3). We then move one step to the right to reach (2,3) and then one step up to reach the target point (3,3).
