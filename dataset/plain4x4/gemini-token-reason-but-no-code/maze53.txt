### Depth-first search (DFS):

To find the solution for a maze, one could use the depth-first search algorithm.
This algorithm starts at the entry point and recursively explores all paths, until it reaches the exit point.
DFS builds a stack of yet-to-be-explored paths.
At each step, it pops the top path from the stack and explores the next adjacent, unvisited node.
If the node is the exit point, the path is valid and we can return it.
Otherwise, we push the path onto the stack and continue with the search.
If we reach a dead end, we discard the path and pop the next path from the stack.

### Solution for the maze:

Starting at the entry point (0,0), we push the path [(0,0)] onto the stack.
Next, we pop the path [(0,0)] from the stack and explore the adjacent, unvisited node (1,0).
We push the path [(0,0), (1,0)] onto the stack and continue with the search.
We repeat this process until we reach the exit point (3,3).
The valid path is [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)].

### Output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
