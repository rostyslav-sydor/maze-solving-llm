To find a solution to a maze represented as an adjacency list, one of the common strategy is to do breadth-first search from the entry point to find a path that leads to the exit point.

In this particular adjacency list, we start the breath-first search from (0,0) to find the exit point (3,3). We maintain a queue, initially containing (0,0) and a list of visited tokens initially containing (0,0).

Now we iterate the queue and for each token in the queue, we append all of its neighbors that have not yet been visited to the queue and list of visited tokens. We stop when we reach (3,3), the exit point.

Here is a path solution in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
