To find a solution for the maze, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starting from the entry point and exploring all possible paths until we reach the exit point.

During DFS we keep track of the current path and backtrack if we reach a dead end.
As soon as we reach the exit point, we have found a solution and we can output the current path.

For the given maze, the DFS algorithm will start from the entry point (0,0) and explore the following path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the solution for the given maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
