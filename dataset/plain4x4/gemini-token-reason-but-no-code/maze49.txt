We can model maze as a graph and use Depth First Search algorithm to find a solution path.
Depth First Search algorithm works by starting at the entry point and recursively following a path until it reaches the exit point. If the path reaches a dead end, the algorithm backtracks to the last intersection and tries a different path.

In case of this example maze we can start from the origin <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and follow the path:

0,0 -> 0,1 -> 0,2 -> 0,3 -> 1,3 -> 3,3

So the solution is:
 
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
