The maze can be represented visually as below:

```
(0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2) - (0,3)
|      |      |      |
(1,0) - (1,1) - (1,2) - (1,3)
|      |      |      |
(2,0) - (2,1) - (2,2) - (2,3)
|      |      |      |
(3,0) - (3,1) - (3,2) - (3,3)
```

To solve the maze, we can use Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is an algorithm that explores each possible path until a solution is found or all paths are exhausted. In a maze, DFS can be used to find a path from the entrance to the exit by recursively exploring all possible paths and backtracking if a path leads to a dead end.

The DFS algorithm can be implemented as follows:

1. Start at the entrance of the maze.
2. If the current location is the exit, then a solution has been found.
3. If the current location is not the exit, then explore all possible paths from the current location.
4. If a path leads to a dead end, then backtrack to the previous location.

Here is the solution to the given maze using DFS:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
