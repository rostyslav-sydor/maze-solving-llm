1. We start at the origin (0,0) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). We choose to go to (1,1).
2. We are now at (1,1) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (0,1), (1,2), and (1,3). We choose to go to (1,2).
3. We are now at (1,2) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (0,2), (1,1), and (1,3). We choose to go to (1,3).
4. We are now at (1,3) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (0,3), (1,2), and (2,3). We choose to go to (2,3).
5. We are now at (2,3) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (1,3), (2,2), and (3,3). We choose to go to (3,3).
6. We are now at (3,3) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (2,3) and (3,2). Since (2,3) leads back to where we came from, we choose to go to (3,2).
7. We are now at (3,2) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (2,2) and (3,3). Since (3,3) leads back to where we came from, we choose to go to (2,2).
8. We are now at (2,2) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (2,3), (2,1), and (3,2). Since (2,3) and (3,2) both lead back to where we came from, we choose to go to (2,1).
9. We are now at (2,1) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (1,1) and (2,0). Since (1,1) leads back to where we came from, we choose to go to (2,0).
10. We are now at (2,0) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (3,0) and (2,1). Since (2,1) leads back to where we came from, we choose to go to (3,0).
11. We are now at (3,0) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (2,0) and (3,1). Since (2,0) leads back to where we came from, we choose to go to (3,1).
12. We are now at (3,1) and look at all the adjacent nodes. We see that we can go to (3,2) and (3,0). Since (3,2) and (3,0) both lead back to where we came from, we have reached the target.

The path from the origin to the target is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,2) (2,2) (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) <PATH_END>
