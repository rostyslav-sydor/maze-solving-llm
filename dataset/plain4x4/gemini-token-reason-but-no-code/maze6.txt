To find the solution of this maze we can use one of the graph search algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS).
BFS algorithm starts from the origin and explores all of its adjacent nodes, then explores all of the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on.
When the algorithm reaches the target, it can backtrack the path from the target to the origin to find the solution.
In this specific case, we can start from the origin (0,0) and explore all adjacent nodes, which are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (0,1), which are (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (1,0), which are (0,0), (1,1), and (2,0).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (1,1), which are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,1).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (0,2), which are (0,1), (0,3), and (1,2).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (2,0), which are (1,0), (2,1), and (3,0).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (1,2), which are (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), and (2,2).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (2,1), which are (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), and (3,1).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (0,3), which are (0,2), (1,3), and (2,3).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (2,2), which are (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,2).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (1,3), which are (0,3), (1,2), and (2,3).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (3,0), which are (2,0), (3,1), and (3,2).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (3,1), which are (2,1), (3,0), and (3,2).
We can then explore all adjacent nodes of (2,3), which are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,3).
When we reach the target (3,3), we can backtrack the path from (3,3) to (0,0) to find the solution: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0).
Therefore, the solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (3,3) (2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0) <PATH_END>
