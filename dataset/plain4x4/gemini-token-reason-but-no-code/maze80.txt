To solve the maze we can use Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. 
DFS is a recursive algorithm that traverses a tree or graph by going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Starting from the origin point, we can explore all possible paths until we reach the target point. 
If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and explore another path.

For the given maze, the solution path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
