**Reasoning:**

1. Starting from the origin, we can check the adjacency list to find which tokens are connected to it.
2. From the connected tokens, we can further check their adjacency lists to find which tokens are connected to them, and so on.
3. By recursively exploring the adjacency lists, we can build a path from the origin to the target.

**Solution for the given maze:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
