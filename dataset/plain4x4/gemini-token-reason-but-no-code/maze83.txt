To solve a maze using an adjacency list, the algorithm should perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the origin.
DFS involves recursively exploring all possible paths from the current node until a target is reached or all paths are exhausted.
For each node, the algorithm should visit all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited before until it reaches the target.
If the target is not found, the algorithm should backtrack and visit the next unvisited adjacent node of the current node's parent.

In the given maze, starting from the origin at (0,0), the adjacent nodes are (0,1) and (1,0).
The algorithm visits (0,1) and finds that it has adjacent nodes (0,2) and (1,1).
It visits (1,1) and finds that it has adjacent nodes (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1).
It visits (1,2) and finds that it has adjacent nodes (1,1) and (2,2).
It visits (2,2) and finds that it has adjacent nodes (1,2), (2,1), and (2,3).
It visits (2,3) and finds that it has adjacent nodes (2,2), (3,3), and (3,2).
It visits (3,3) and finds that it is the target.

The solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
