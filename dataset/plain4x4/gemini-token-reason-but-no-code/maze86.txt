* First start with the <ORIGIN> token and traverse the graph until <TARGET> token is found.
* The graph is traversed in the Depth First Search manner, so when a new node is found, all of its neighbors are traversed before backtracking to the previously visited nodes.
* In our example maze, starting at the <ORIGIN> token at (0,0), we can move to the right to (1,0), or down to (0,1).
* Let's explore the path to the right first. At (1,0), we can move right to (2,0), or up to (1,1).
* We will continue to move right until we hit a dead end, which in this case is at (3,0).
* Now we will backtrack and explore the path down from (0,1).
* Following this path, we will eventually reach the <TARGET> token at (3,3).
* The path from <ORIGIN> to <TARGET> is: (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3).
