It is possible to solve this maze by using Breadth First Search approach, starting from the entry point, iterating through neighbors of each cell and marking cells that have been traversed.
The final path from the entry point to the exit point is obtained by backtracking through previously marked cells until the end point is reached.

The solution below demonstrates a path from the entry point to the exit point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
