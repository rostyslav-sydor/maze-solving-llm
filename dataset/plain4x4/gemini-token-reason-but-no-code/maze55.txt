Let's use a depth first search to explore the maze starting from the origin. Since this maze is not weighted, a simple DFS is sufficient.

We can start from the origin at coordinate (0,0) and explore the maze. At each step, we can choose one of the adjacent cells that has not been visited yet. If we reach the target cell at coordinate (3,3), we have found a path. If we explore all the adjacent cells without finding the target, we backtrack and try a different path.

Here is a specific solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> 
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(0,3)
(1,3)
(1,2)
(1,1)
(1,0)
(2,0)
(3,0)
(3,1)
(3,2)
(3,3) 
<PATH_END>
