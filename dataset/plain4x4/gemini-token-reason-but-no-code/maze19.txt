The problem requires us to find a path between the starting and the ending points. To achieve this we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on the graph.

In a BFS algorithm, we start from our starting point and add it to a queue. We then remove the first element (the one with the smallest index) from the queue and set it as our current position. For each of the neighbors of our current position, if it is not already in the queue, we add it to the queue. We continue this process until either we have found the end point or the queue is empty.

In our case, we start from the starting point (0,0) and add it to the queue. We then remove the first element from the queue and set it as our current position. The neighbors of our current position are (0,1), (1,0), and (3,3). Since (0,1) and (1,0) are already in the queue, we only add (3,3) to the queue. We continue this process until we have found the end point (3,3).

The path from the starting point to the end point is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
