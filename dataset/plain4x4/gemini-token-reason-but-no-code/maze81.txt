The maze can be solved by performing Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).
The algorithm should begin by initializing an empty list called 'path' to store the coordinates of the current path being explored and the list of all explored coordinates called 'visited'.
Then we add the entry coordinate (0,0) to the 'visited' list and the 'path' list.
The algorithm should then iterate over the neighbors of the current coordinate and recursively call itself for each neighbor that has not yet been visited.
If any of the recursive calls return True, indicating that a solution has been found, the algorithm should add the current coordinate to the 'path' list and return True.
If none of the recursive calls return True, the algorithm should remove the current coordinate from the 'path' list and return False.
To find a specific solution for the given maze, we can start from the entry coordinate (0,0) and explore its neighbors in the order specified by the adjacency list.
By following the algorithm described above, we can find the following solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
