The provided maze can be represented as a graph using the adjacency list given. To find a path from the starting to the ending point, we can use the breadth-first search algorithm.

Beginning at the starting point (0,0), we can explore the adjacent nodes (0,1) and (1,0). From (0,1), we can explore (0,0) and (0,2). From (1,0), we can explore (0,0) and (2,0). This process continues until we reach the ending point (3,3).

The path from the starting to the ending point is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
