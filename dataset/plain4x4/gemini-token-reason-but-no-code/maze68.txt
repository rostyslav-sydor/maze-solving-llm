To find a solution to the maze, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the origin point and exploring all possible paths until we reach the target point.

If we encounter a dead end (i.e., a point with no unexplored neighbors), we backtrack to the most recent point with unexplored neighbors and continue the search from there.

For the given maze, the DFS algorithm would start from the origin point (0,0) and explore the following path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path leads directly to the target point (3,3), so it is a valid solution to the maze.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
