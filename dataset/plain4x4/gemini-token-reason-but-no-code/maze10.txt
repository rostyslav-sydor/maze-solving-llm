Let us perform a breadth-first search starting from the origin cell. 

We will keep track of the parent of each cell so that we can reconstruct the path later. 

At each step, we will add all unvisited neighbors to the queue. 

Once we reach the target cell, we can stop the search. 

Let us now reconstruct the path by starting at the target cell and following the parents back to the origin cell.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
