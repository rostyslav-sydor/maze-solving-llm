There are multiple possible solutions or paths through the maze. One of the possible solutions is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>

Starting at the origin, one must first move right to (1,0) and then down to (2,0). From there, one can either move right to (3,0) or up to (2,1). In this solution, the path moves up to (2,1) and then right to (3,1) before moving up to (3,2) and finally right to the target at (3,3).

Other possible solutions include:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
