**Algorithm**: 
Depth First Search (DFS): This is a recursive algorithm that traverses a graph by going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In the context of a maze, this means exploring all the paths from the current position until a dead end is reached, at which point the algorithm backtracks to the last position that had unexplored paths.

**Solution for the provided maze**:
1. Start at the origin (0,0).
2. Explore the path to the right (0,1), but it is a dead end.
3. Backtrack to (0,0) and explore the path down (1,0), but it is also a dead end.
4. Backtrack to (0,0) again and explore the path to the right (1,1).
5. Continue exploring this path until you reach the target (3,3).

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
