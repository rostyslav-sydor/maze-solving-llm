To find the solution, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
DFS starts from entry point, chooses an unvisited path and explores that path until it reaches exit or there are no more unvisited paths to explore.
If the exit is not reached, DFS backtracks to the previous choice point and chooses another unvisited path.

In this case, the entry point is (0,0) and exit point is (3,3).
We can start DFS from the entry point and choose the path (0,1).
The next unvisited path is (1,1), which leads to the exit point.
Therefore, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
