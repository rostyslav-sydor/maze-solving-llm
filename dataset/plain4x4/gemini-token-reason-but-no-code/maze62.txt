**Strategy:**

1. Perform a breadth-first search starting from the origin and continue until the target is found.
2. Keep track of the path taken during the search.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a queue and enqueue the origin node.
2. Mark the origin node as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue the current node from the queue.
    - Check if the current node is the target node.
        - If it is, return the path taken to reach the target.
    - For each adjacent node of the current node:
        - If the adjacent node has not been visited:
            - Enqueue the adjacent node into the queue.
            - Mark the adjacent node as visited.

**Solution for the Given Maze:**

**Reasoning:**

- We start at the origin (0,0) and enqueue it into the queue.
- We then visit its adjacent nodes: (0,1), (1,0), and (0,2).
- We enqueue the unvisited nodes: (0,1) and (1,0) into the queue.
- We continue visiting adjacent nodes and enqueueing unvisited nodes until we reach the target node (3,3).
- We then backtrack through the visited nodes to construct the path taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

**Output:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
