A maze is represented as a graph. A graph can be traversed with a breadth-first search. In order to solve a maze with a breadth-first search all nodes must be visited starting from the starting node. The next nodes to visit are the neighbors of the current node, until all nodes are visited. At the end of the search all nodes will have a minimum distance to the starting node. The path to the end node is the path of nodes with decreasing distance to the starting node.

For the maze given in the question, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
