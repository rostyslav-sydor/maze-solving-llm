In order to find a solution for the maze, you can use a breadth-first search algorithm.

This algorithm starts at the origin point and explores all of the adjacent points.
It then continues to explore all of the adjacent points of the adjacent points, and so on, until it reaches the target point.

The path to the target point can be found by backtracking from the target point to the origin point, recording the coordinates of each point along the way.

For the given maze, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
