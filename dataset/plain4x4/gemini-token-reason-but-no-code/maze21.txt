This maze can be solved by using Depth-First Search algorithm.

DFS algorithm can be used to find a path between two points in a graph, by recursively exploring all possible paths until it reaches the target point.
Starting from the origin point, we can explore all possible paths by visiting all adjacent points until we reach the target point.
If we reach a dead end, we can backtrack to the previous point and continue exploring other paths.
In this way, we can find a solution to the maze if one exists.

For the given maze, the solution can be found as follows:

Starting from the origin point (0,0), we can explore the adjacent points (0,1) and (1,0).
From (0,1), we can explore the adjacent points (0,2), (0,0), and (1,1).
From (1,1), we can explore the adjacent points (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2).
From (2,1), we can explore the adjacent points (2,2), (1,1), and (3,1).
From (3,1), we can explore the adjacent points (3,2), (2,1), and (3,0).
From (3,2), we can explore the adjacent points (3,3), (3,1), and (2,2).
Finally, we reach the target point (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
