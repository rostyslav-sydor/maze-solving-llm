To find a solution for the maze we will use Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
DFS starts at the entry point and explores all possible paths until it reaches the exit point or until there are no more paths to explore.
At each step, DFS chooses the first unexplored path and follows it until it reaches a dead end or the exit point.
If DFS reaches a dead end, it backtracks to the last explored path and continues from there.
Here is a solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
