In this maze, we can use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point.

We start by creating a queue and adding the starting point to it.
Then, we iterate over the queue until it is empty.
For each point in the queue, we check if it is the ending point.
If it is, then we have found the shortest path and we can stop.
If it is not, then we add all of its adjacent points to the queue.
We continue this process until we find the ending point.

In this specific maze, the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (3,3) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
