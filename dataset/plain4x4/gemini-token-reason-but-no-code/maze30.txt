We can use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the maze and find a path from entry to exit.

Starting from the entry point, we can traverse the maze by visiting each unvisited adjacent token and marking it as visited. If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and continue traversing from the last visited token. We repeat this process until we reach the exit point.

For the given maze, we start from the entry point (0,0) and traverse the maze as follows:

- Visit (0,1) and mark it as visited.
- Visit (0,2) and mark it as visited.
- Visit (0,3) and mark it as visited.
- Visit (1,3) and mark it as visited.
- Visit (2,3) and mark it as visited.
- Visit (3,3) and mark it as visited.

We have now reached the exit point (3,3). The path from entry to exit is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
