This is a undirected graph with no weights.
To solve this maze we can use Depth First Search (DFS)/Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms.

Here is DFS solution:

1. We start at the origin (0,0) and add it to the stack.
2. We then iterate over the neighbors of (0,0) and add them to the stack.
3. We continue this process until we reach the target (3,3).
4. Once we reach the target, we can output the path by popping the elements from the stack.

Here is a specific solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
