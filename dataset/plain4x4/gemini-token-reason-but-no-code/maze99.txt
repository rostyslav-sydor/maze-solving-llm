To find a path through a maze represented as an adjacency list, one can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
DFS starts at the origin node and explores all of its adjacent nodes, then all of the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and so on.
If a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the most recent node that has unexplored adjacent nodes.
The algorithm terminates when the target node is reached or when there are no more unexplored nodes.

In the given maze, we can start at the origin node (0,0) and explore its adjacent nodes (1,0) and (0,1).
We can then explore the adjacent nodes of (1,0), which are (1,1) and (2,0).
We can continue in this manner until we reach the target node (3,3).
The path through the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
