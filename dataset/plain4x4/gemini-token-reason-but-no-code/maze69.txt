**Reasoning:**

Breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to solve the maze by systematically exploring all paths starting from the origin until the target is reached.

Starting at the origin, BFS creates a queue of neighboring cells that have not been visited yet. The algorithm then visits each cell in the queue, adding its unvisited neighbors to the queue until the target cell is reached.

**Specific solution:**

For the given maze, the BFS algorithm will explore the following paths:

- (0,0)
- (0,1), (1,0)
- (1,1), (0,2), (2,0)
- (0,3), (2,1), (1,2)
- (2,2), (1,3)
- (3,3)

Therefore, the solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
