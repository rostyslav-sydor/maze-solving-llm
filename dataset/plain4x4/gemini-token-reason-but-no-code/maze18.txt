The maze is represented as a graph and can be solved using a graph search algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS).

Starting at origin, we can use DFS to find a path to the target by recursively visiting unvisited neighbors until the target is reached.

For the given maze, starting from (0,0), we visit the neighbor (1,0) then (2,0) and reach the target (3,3).

The resulting path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>
