The maze can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
DFS starts from the origin and explores all possible paths until it reaches the target.
If a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks and explores other paths.
The path from the origin to the target can be found by recording the sequence of coordinates visited during the DFS.

In this specific maze, the solution path is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
