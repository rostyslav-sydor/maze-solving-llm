To solve a maze using the adjacency list representation, one has to traverse the list, starting at the entry point, and find all nodes that are connected to the current one.
Then choose one of the nodes, and continue the process, until the exit point is found.

In our case, the adjacency list starts with (2,1), which has two adjacent nodes, (1,1) and (3,1).

We choose (1,1) as the next node, which has two adjacent nodes, (1,0) and (0,0).

We choose (1,0) as the next node, which has only one adjacent node, (0,0).

Since this is the exit point, we stop here.

The path from the entry point to the exit point is therefore:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) <PATH_END>
