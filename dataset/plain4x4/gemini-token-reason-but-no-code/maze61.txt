Depth-First Search (DFS) is a popular algorithm to find a solution for a maze.
For DFS we start from the entry point, which is marked with <ORIGIN_START> and <ORIGIN_END> tokens, in this case (0,0).
We explore every available path recursively, until either we get to the target point (which is marked with <TARGET_START> and <TARGET_END> tokens in this case (3,3)) or all paths are exhausted.
At every step we mark a cell as visited to avoid going in an infinite loop.
At every step we also save the previous node in the path, so that the final path can be reconstructed.
For the given maze, the following path is found using DFS:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
