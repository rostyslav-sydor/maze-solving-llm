This maze can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. 

DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at the entry point, and explores all possible paths until it finds the exit point.
If the exit point is not found, the algorithm backtracks to the last unexplored path and continues exploring.

To solve this maze using DFS, we can start at the entry point and explore all possible paths by following the edges of the graph. 
If we reach a dead end, we backtrack to the last unexplored path and continue exploring. 

We can mark the nodes that we have visited, so that we do not explore them again.

Once we find the exit point, we can backtrack along the path to find the solution.
The solution is a list of coordinates that represent the path from the entry point to the exit point.

For the given maze, the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
