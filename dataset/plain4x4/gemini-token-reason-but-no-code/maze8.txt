To find the solution for the maze, we can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. DFS involves starting from the initial node and exploring all its neighbor nodes recursively. If a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks and explores other paths.

In this case, we can start from the origin point (0,0) and explore its neighbors. Let's say we find a path to the target point (3,3). The path would be a sequence of nodes that connect the origin and target points. We can trace this path back to find the solution.

Starting from the origin point (0,0), we move to (0,1), then to (0,2), then to (0,3), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), and finally to (3,3). Therefore, the solution path is: <PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>.
