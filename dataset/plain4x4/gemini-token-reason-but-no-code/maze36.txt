First we should find the shortest path between the entry point and exit point in the adjacency list. 
Let's use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for this purpose. 
We start at the entry point and add it to the queue. 
We then visit all adjacent nodes and add them to the queue if they have not been visited yet. 
We repeat this process until we reach the exit point. 
The path from the entry point to the exit point can be found by backtracking from the exit point to the entry point.

For the given maze, the shortest path from the entry point to the exit point is: 

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
