In a maze, there is a single path between entry and exit points, except in cases where there are cycles.
In the provided example, there are no cycles.

The adjacency list allows us to determine if there is a path between any two adjacent tokens in the maze.

Starting from the entry token <ORIGIN_START>, we can iteratively search for all adjacent tokens and include them in the solution path, until we reach the exit token <TARGET_END>.

In the given maze, we start at <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) and see that there are two adjacent tokens (0,1) and (1,0).
We arbitrarily choose to move to (0,1), which then gives us two more adjacent tokens (0,2) and (1,1).
We continue this process until we reach the exit token <TARGET_END> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution path for the given maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (1,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
