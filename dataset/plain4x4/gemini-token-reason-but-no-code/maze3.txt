A maze can be solved by using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start at the origin, and then try all possible moves from that point. If a move leads to a dead end, we backtrack and try a different move. If a move leads to the target, we have found a solution.

Using the adjacency list provided, we can construct a graph of the maze. The nodes of the graph are the cells of the maze, and the edges of the graph are the possible moves from one cell to another.

We can then use a breadth-first search algorithm to find a solution to the maze. We start at the origin, and then add all of the possible moves from that point to a queue. We then dequeue the first item from the queue, and add all of the possible moves from that point to the queue. We continue this process until we reach the target.

For the maze provided, the solution is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
