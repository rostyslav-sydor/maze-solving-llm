The Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm can be used to find a path from the origin to the target in a maze.
The algorithm starts at the origin and recursively explores all possible paths.
If a path leads to the target, the algorithm stops and returns the path.
If no path leads to the target, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different path.

To apply DFS to the provided maze, we can use the adjacency list to represent the maze.
We can start at the origin token and recursively explore all possible paths.
If a path leads to the target token, we stop and return the path.
If no path leads to the target token, we backtrack and try a different path.

In the provided maze, there is only one path from the origin to the target.
The path is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
