Let us first try to understand the structure of the maze.
It is a graph where nodes are coordinates of a grid, and edges are connections between neighboring nodes.
We are given starting and ending points, and we need to find a path from the starting point to the ending point.

One of the simplest algorithms to solve this problem is a depth-first search.
This algorithm traverses all possible paths until it finds a path to the ending point.
In this case, we start from the starting point and recursively visit all its neighbors until we reach the ending point.

Let us apply this algorithm to the given maze.

We start from the starting point (0,0).
Its neighbors are (0,1), (1,0).
We first visit (0,1).
Its neighbor is (0,2).
We first visit (0,2).
Its neighbors are (0,3), (1,2).
We first visit (0,3).
Its neighbor is (1,3).
We first visit (1,3).
Its neighbors are (1,2), (2,3).
We first visit (1,2).
Its neighbors are (0,2), (2,2).
We first visit (0,2).
We have already visited this node, so we backtrack to (1,3).
Its other neighbor is (2,3).
We visit (2,3).
Its neighbors are (1,3), (3,3).
We first visit (1,3).
We have already visited this node, so we backtrack to (2,3).
Its other neighbor is (3,3).
This is the ending point, so we have found a solution.

The solution is the path from the starting point to the ending point:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
