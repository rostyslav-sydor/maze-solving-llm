**Finding a solution in a maze using Depth-First Search (DFS)**

A maze can be represented as a graph, where each cell is a node and each connection between cells is an edge. To find a solution to a maze, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). DFS is a recursive algorithm that traverses a graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**The DFS algorithm:**

1. Start at the starting cell.
2. If the current cell is the goal cell, return the path to the goal cell.
3. Otherwise, for each unvisited neighbor of the current cell:
    1. Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
    2. If DFS returns a path to the goal cell, return that path.
4. If no unvisited neighbors of the current cell have a path to the goal cell, backtrack to the previous cell.

**Applying DFS to the given maze**

We start at the starting cell (0,0) and explore the maze using DFS. We first explore the path to the right, then the path down, then the path to the left, and finally the path up. We reach a dead end at the cell (1,3) and backtrack to the cell (0,2). We then explore the path to the right, which leads to the goal cell (3,3). The path to the goal cell is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
