**Reasoning:**

To find a solution to a maze, we can use a graph search algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS). DFS starts at the origin and explores all possible paths until it finds a target. If there is no target, DFS backtracks and explores other paths.

**Specific Solution:**

Using DFS on the given maze, we find the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
