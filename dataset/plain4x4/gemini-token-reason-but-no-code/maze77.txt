We would like to move from (0,0) to (3,3), so let us find a path that connects the two.

Starting at (0,0) we have an option to go right to (1,0) or down to (0,1), let us go down first.
At (0,1) we can either stay in same column and go down to (0,2), or go to right to (1,1) then to (1,2).
Let us first go right, so that we can connect to (3,3) from the bottom.
At (1,2) we have a choice between going right or down. Going down would lead to an infinite loop between (1,2) and (1,3).
Therefore let us go right, and then from (2,2) we have to go right to reach (3,2) and finally from there down to (3,3).
This gives as a complete path from (0,0) to (3,3) as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
