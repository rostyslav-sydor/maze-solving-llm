The maze can be solved using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
DFS is an algorithm that starts at the root node of a graph and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
In this case, the graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each node is a tuple of coordinates and each edge is a pair of coordinates.
The algorithm starts at the origin node and explores as far as possible along each path until it reaches the target node.
If the target node is not reached, the algorithm backtracks and explores another path.
The algorithm terminates when either the target node is reached or all paths have been explored.

In the given maze, the algorithm would start at the origin node (0,0) and explore the path to the target node (3,3).
The path would be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
