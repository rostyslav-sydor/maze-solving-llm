**Reasoning**

A maze is solved by finding the path from an entry point to the exit point. The adjacency list representation of a maze provides us with a graph structure where nodes are represented by coordinates and edges are represented by adjacencies between coordinates. To solve a maze, we need to traverse this graph from the entry point to the exit point. Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms are commonly used to traverse a graph and find a path between two nodes. However, DFS has a tendency to get stuck in dead ends, and BFS can be inefficient in exploring a graph with many branches. To address these limitations, we can use an algorithm that combines the best of both worlds - DFS + Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS), which is essentially DFS with bounded depth. Here's how it works:

* We start with a depth limit of 0 and gradually increase the depth limit by 1 in each iteration of IDDFS
* In each iteration, we perform DFS to explore the graph up to the specified depth limit
* If the exit point is found within the current depth limit, we return the solution
* Otherwise, we reset the DFS and increase the depth limit by 1
* We continue the process until either the exit point is found or the depth limit reaches the maximum depth of the graph

**Solution**

Applying the DFS+IDDFS algorithm to the provided maze, we get the following solution: <PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
