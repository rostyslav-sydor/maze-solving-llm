This maze can be solved using the depth-first search algorithm.
Starting from the origin point, we can recursively explore the maze by following the paths from the current point to all its adjacent points, until we reach the target point.

If we hit a dead end at any point during the exploration, we can backtrack to the previous point and try a different path.

In this particular maze, the solution is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
