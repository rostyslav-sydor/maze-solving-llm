To solve the maze, it is important to find a path, that is a way without loops, from the <ORIGIN> to <TARGET>.
To find it, one can start iterating from <ORIGIN> to all the adjacent cells and, for each adjacent cell, start iterating to all its adjacent cells. In doing so, at every iteration one should mark the coordinate of that specific cell in order to keep trace of the path that one has already visited and avoid loops. 
Once one reaches the <TARGET> cell, it will be able to go back and trace the path by looking at all of the adjacent coordinates marked until it finds that the previous coordinate was in fact the <ORIGIN> one. 
For the maze specified, this algorithm would output the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
