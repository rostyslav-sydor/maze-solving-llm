To find a solution to a maze, one can use a number of algorithms, such as Depth-First/Breadth-First search, A* algorithm or a maze solver algorithm specifically designed for mazes.

In this specific case, a simple Depth-first search is sufficient to find a solution.

Starting from the origin point, we can recursively explore all possible paths until we reach the target point, marking nodes as visited to avoid looping.

For the provided maze, a possible solution would be:
<PATH_START>(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)<PATH_END>
