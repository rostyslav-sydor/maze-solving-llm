Depth-first search starts at the origin token and goes as far as it can along each branch before backtracking.

Following this approach, from origin token at (0, 0) we go to (0, 1), then to (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3) (target token) which is a valid path as follows:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
