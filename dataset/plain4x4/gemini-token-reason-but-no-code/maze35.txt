**Reasoning:**
The maze is represented as an adjacency list, which can be converted to an adjacency matrix, upon which a depth first search can be performed to find a solution path.

The adjacency matrix can be constructed by iterating over the adjacency list, and for each entry, setting the corresponding entry in the matrix to 1, if there exists an edge between two coordinates.

The depth first search can be performed by iterating over the adjacency matrix, starting from the origin coordinate, and for each entry, if it is 1, recursively calling the depth first search function on the corresponding coordinate. If the depth first search reaches the target coordinate, a solution path has been found, and it can be output as a list of coordinates.

For the given maze, the solution path can be found by applying the depth first search algorithm on the adjacency matrix. The resulting path is:

<PATH_START> (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3) <PATH_END>
