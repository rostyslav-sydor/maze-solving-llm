For this specific maze we can use Depth first search (DFS) to find a solution. Starting from the origin point (0,0) we can try each of the adjacent coordinates (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). Since (0,1) and (1,0) are dead ends, we can backtrack to (0,0) and try the remaining adjacent coordinate (1,1). From (1,1) we can reach the target point (3,3) by following the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3).

Therefore, the solution to the maze is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
