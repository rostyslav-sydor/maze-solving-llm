Let us apply Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the origin to the target.
Starting at the origin, we explore all possible paths until we reach the target or until there are no more paths to explore.
If we reach the target, we have found a solution and can backtrack to find the path.
If we do not reach the target, we backtrack and try a different path.

For the given maze, the DFS algorithm will explore the following paths:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,0) (3,3) <PATH_END>

The first path is a solution, so we can backtrack to find the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3) <PATH_END>
