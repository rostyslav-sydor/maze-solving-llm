**Reasoning:**
The maze can be represented as a graph, where each token is a node and each connecting line is an edge. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the starting to the ending token.

We start at token number 0, which is the origin, and mark it as visited. Then, we check all the tokens that are connected to token 0 and add them to a queue. We then mark each of those tokens as visited. We repeat this process until we reach the target token.

**Solution:**

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END>
