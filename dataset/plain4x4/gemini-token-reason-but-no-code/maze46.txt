For solving a maze, depth first search is an algorithm that is used. We start at the entry point and try all possible paths. If we find an exit point, then we return. Otherwise we backtrack to the latest intersection and try a different path.
First we identify the entry and exit points of the maze.
In this case the entry point is (0,0) and exit point is (3,3).

We start at the entry point and add it to a list of coordinates.
We then recursively call the function on all of the neighbors of the current coordinate.
If any of the neighbor coordinates is the exit point, then we return the list of coordinates.

If none of the neighbor coordinates are the exit point, then we remove the current coordinate from the list and backtrack to the previous coordinate.

The algorithm will continue until either the exit point is found or there are no more coordinates to explore.

In this case the solution is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
