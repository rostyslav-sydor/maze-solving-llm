The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm can be used to solve mazes. It involves exploring all possible paths from a starting point until the destination is reached.

We can represent the maze as a graph, where nodes represent cells and edges represent connections between cells. The DFS algorithm can be applied to the graph to find a path from the starting node to the destination node.

**DFS algorithm:**

1. Start at the starting node.
2. Mark the current node as visited.
3. If the current node is the destination node, the path has been found.
4. Otherwise, for each adjacent node that has not been visited, recurse to step 2.

**DFS applied to the given maze:**

<ADJLIST_START> (3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; (0,0) <--> (0,1) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (1,1) <--> (1,2) ; (1,3) <--> (2,3) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

Starting at (0,0), the DFS algorithm would explore the following path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Therefore, the solution to the maze is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
