We can use depth-first search to solve a maze.
We start from the origin point and recursively explore all possible paths.
If we reach the target point, then we have found a solution.
If we have explored all possible paths and have not reached the target point, then there is no solution.

For the given maze, we can start at the origin point (0,0), and explore the following path:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path leads us to the target point, so this is a solution to the maze.

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
