**Reasoning**

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing and searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores all of the node's neighbors before moving on to the next level of the graph.

This algorithm is useful for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, as it will always find the shortest path if one exists.

**Solution**

In the given maze, we can use BFS to find the shortest path between the start and end points.

We start at the start point (0,0) and add it to a queue. We then loop through the queue, adding each node's neighbors to the queue until we reach the end point (3,3).

The following is the solution path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) <PATH_END>
