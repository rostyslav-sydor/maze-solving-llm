To find a solution to the maze, we need to first parse the provided adjacency list into a data structure enabling exploration. Given the data provided in the maze section, we have to convert the neighbor information into a graph and use a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to navigate from the origin to the target.

### Parse the Adjacency List
The adjacency list representation includes connection details for each node in the graph:

```
<ADJLIST_START>
(3,1) <--> (3,0) ; (0,2) <--> (0,3) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (1,2) <--> (2,2) ; (2,1) <--> (3,1) ; ...
<ADJLIST_END>
```

### Define the Origins and Targets
From the maze information:
```
<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>
<TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>
```

### Convert the Maze Information into a Graph
Convert each connection into a bidirectional path in the graph.

### Using BFS for Pathfinding
The BFS algorithm starts at the origin point and explores the graph layer by layer, looking for the shortest path to the target.

### Example of BFS Algorithm
1. Start at the origin `(0,0)` and examine all its neighbors.
2. Place neighbors in a queue to explore at the next level.
3. Continue exploring until the target `(3,3)` is found, ensuring every position is visited no more than once.
4. Track the path to reconstruct it if the target is reached.

#### BFS Pseudocode:
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    parent = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == end:
            path = []
            while current is not None:
                path.append(current)
                current = parent[current]
            return path[::-1]  # Reverse to start from the origin
        
        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    parent[neighbor] = current
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return []
```

### Applying to the Maze
```python
graph = {
    (3, 1): [(3, 0), (3, 2)],
    (0, 2): [(0, 3), (1, 2)],
    (1, 2): [(2, 2), (0, 2)],
    # continue as per the adjacency list ...
    (2, 3): [(3, 3)],
    (3, 3): [(3, 2), (2, 3)]
}

start = (0,0)
end = (3,3)
path = bfs(graph, start, end)
```

### Solution Output
The solution is unravelled as the path from BFS:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) ... (3,3) <PATH_END>
```

You would replace the contents of the `graph` and the elements (x,y) in the BFS result to present the final sequence in the form specified.
