I understand. Here is the solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,2) (4,3) (5,2) (5,3) (6,2) (6,3) (7,2) (7,3) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Please note that there is only one possible solution for this maze.
