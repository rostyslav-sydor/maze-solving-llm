Here is the solution for the given maze:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). The walls are marked with hash signs, and the path avoids them by following the available routes.

Please note that the path is not the only solution, and there may be other valid paths as well.
