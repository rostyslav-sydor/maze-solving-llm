I understand. Here is a solution for the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6) (7,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (7,7). The walls are marked with hash signs, and the path avoids them by following the available routes.

Please note that this solution is limited to 200 words, as requested.
