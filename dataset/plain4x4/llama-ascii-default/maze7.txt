I understand. Here is the solution to the maze you provided:

<PATH_START> (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) (4,6) (5,6) (5,7) <PATH_END>

The path starts at coordinate (1,1) and ends at coordinate (5,7). Walls are marked with hash signs.

Please note that there is only one possible solution for this maze.
