To solve the maze, we start at entry point (0,0) and note the walls block us from moving directly south or east. Thus, our only option is to move down (south) to (1,0). From (1,0), we move to (2,0) as moving east is blocked by a wall.

At (2,0), our path must continue south to (3,0) since east is still blocked. From (3,0), we can only move right (east) because the southern direction is the edge, and west is the start. We thus proceed to (3,1), then further to (3,2). 

From (3,2), we move east to (3,3), which is marked as the exit point.

Putting it all together, the path coordinates are:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <PATH_END> 

We navigated by moving sequentially down the leftmost column and then rightwards along the bottom row to reach the exit.
