To solve the maze, we need to determine a path from the entry point (origin) to the exit point (target) by navigating through the connections available in the adjacency list. The maze is represented as coordinates where each pair of coordinates indicates a possible movement between those two points.

The origin of the maze is at (0,0) and the target is at (4,5). To find a path, we can utilize graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is generally more suitable for this kind of problem, as it explores all possible directions at each step, ensuring the shortest path is found when reaching the target.

Following the adjacency list provided, the BFS algorithm can be implemented to keep track of visited points and the path to reach them. Starting from (0,0), we would explore all connected points and continue spreading out until the target (4,5) is reached, ensuring to not revisit any points to prevent cycles and redundant searches.

Following this approach by considering all the connecting nodes and finding the shortest path, the solution to this specific maze is derived as follows:

- Start at (0,0) and navigate to possible points as per the adjacency list.
- From (0,0) move to (1,0) following (1,0) <--> (0,0).
- From (1,0) move to (2,0) following (2,0) <--> (1,0).
- From (2,0) move to (3,0) following (2,0) <--> (3,0).
- From (3,0) move to (4,0) following (4,0) <--> (3,0).
- From (4,0) move to (4,1) following (4,0) <--> (4,1).
- From (4,1) move to (4,2) following (4,1) <--> (4,2).
- From (4,2) move to (4,3) following (4,3) <--> (4,2).
- From (4,3) move to (4,4) following (4,3) <--> (4,4).
- From (4,4) move to (4,5) following (4,4) <--> (4,5) which is the target.

This path systematically follows through valid routes in the adjacency list efficiently and reaches the destination as required. Here is the solution formatted in the requested manner:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
