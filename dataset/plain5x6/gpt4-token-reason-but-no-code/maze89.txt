To solve the maze, which has been represented using an adjacency list of graph connections between various points or nodes, we first need to understand the relationships between these points. Here, every connection `(x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2)` represents a walkable path directly between two coordinates in a grid.

To find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,5)`, we can utilize a basic search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS). This algorithm is well-suited for an unweighted graph like ours, where each step from one node to another has the same 'cost' or distance. BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which is perfect for ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted scenario such as a standard maze.

### Steps for Solving the Maze:
1. **Start from the Origin**: Initialize the search from the origin `(0,0)`.
2. **Explore Neighbors**: Utilize BFS to explore all accessible neighboring coordinates from the current position.
3. **Queue for BFS**: Enqueue each discovered coordinate that can be reached, marking it as visited.
4. **Path Reconstruction**: When we reach the target `(4,5)`, backtrack through the visited nodes to construct the path from the origin to the target.
5. **Output the Path**: Present the path in the specified format.

### Solution:
Now, considering the graph's connections in the adjacency list, we perform BFS. The solution path will be the series of coordinates that BFS takes to get from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)`. 

By inspecting the adjacency list and tracing BFS traversal:
- Starting at `(0,0)`, the next connected node is `(1,0)` (from the `(1,0) <--> (0,0)` connection).
- From `(1,0)`, we traverse to `(1,1)`, then to `(2,1)` and so forth, following available paths in a way that eventually leads to `(4,5)`.

Conducting BFS and marking each node until reaching our target, we derive the path based on connections and shortest reachability in terms of steps.
  
Given the adjacency list and applying the BFS approach, the path found is as follows:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
```

This path directly results from the BFS exploration of the grid based on the adjacency list, each step making sure to only move to adjacent, directly connected nodes until the destination is reached.
