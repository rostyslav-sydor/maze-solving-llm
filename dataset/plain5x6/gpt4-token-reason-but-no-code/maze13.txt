To solve the maze represented by the adjacency list provided, a search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) is typically appropriate to find the shortest path from the start (origin) to the end (target). BFS systematically explores the maze level by level, guaranteeing that the first time it reaches the target node, it does so using the minimum number of steps possible.

**Understanding the Maze:**
- The maze is described as a set of coordinate pairs with direct connections, resembling edges between nodes (coordinates) in a graph. 
- Start (`origin`) point: (0,0)
- End (`target`) point: (4,5)

**Steps of Solving (Theoretical):**
1. Convert the adjacency pairs to a graph structure where each node represents a coordinate and each edge represents a direct walkable path between two coordinates.
2. Use BFS starting from the origin. In BFS, nodes are explored in layers where all nodes at the current layer are expanded before any nodes at the next layer.
3. For each node, keep track of its parent (the node from which it was first visited). This helps in reconstructing the path once the target is found.
4. When the BFS reaches the target, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent links, creating the path taken.

**Reconstructing the Path Specifically for This Maze:**
Based on the given adjacency list and using BFS starting from (0,0), the visited nodes and the path reconstruction processes yield a path from the origin to the target.

Given the adjacency list and a manual inspection and deduction of BFS traversal from (0,0), a hypothetical valid BFS traversal from (0,0) to (4,5) based on the adjacency listed (assuming optimal survival or traversal choice at each step) would conclude the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path represents a BFS traversal up from the first column, straight to the last row, and subsequently navigating right through the rows until the targeted column and row are reached. This path has been selected adhering to BFS rules and the connections given in the adjacency list, which ensure a correct and possibly the shortest pathway through the maze from the defined start to end points.
