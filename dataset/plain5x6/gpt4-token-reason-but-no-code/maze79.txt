The given maze adjacency list defines connections between different coordinates in a graph format, representing a possible movement from one coordinate to another. To find a solution, the task is to determine a path from the start coordinate (origin) to the end coordinate (target).

The start point provided is (0,0) and the endpoint is (4,5). To solve the maze, one approach is the breadth-first search (BFS) method, which is used to search the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Using BFS, starting from (0,0), the maze is systematically explored, expanding outward to neighboring nodes, until the target node (4,5) is reached. This approach ensures that the first time we visit a node, the path discovered to that node is the shortest.

**Solution Steps:**
1. Begin BFS from (0,0). Add this to the queue.
2. Dequeue (0,0) and enqueue its neighbors while marking (0,0) as visited. According to adjacency list: Enqueue (0,1).
3. Next, dequeue (0,1) and enqueue its neighbors. From (0,1) enqueue (1,1), (0,0), and (0,2).
4. Continue dequeuing the next node and enqueueing its neighbors while marking them visited.
5. This process continues systematically visiting each node and checking all connections provided in the adjacency list.
6. The search terminates when the target node (4,5) is dequeued and thus reached.

From the BFS, it's observed nodes are visited in the shortest path order due to the nature of BFS. Here is the path extracted from the BFS operations:

**Final Path:** From (0,0) to (4,5): (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5).

**Formatted Answer:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,3) (1,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path highlights succinct movement through the maze from the designated start to the finish, ensuring all necessary connections are used appropriately while avoiding revisits and ensuring the shortest path based on BFS properties.
