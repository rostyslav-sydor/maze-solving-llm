To solve the maze represented in the adjacency list provided, we first need to understand and extract the structure of the maze â€” which includes the entry and exit points. From the data, the origin is at <ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>, and the target is at <TARGET_START> (4,5) <TARGET_END>.

Next, we convert the adjacency representation into a graph structure we can traverse. Each coordinate pair is a node, and each connection (relationship indicated by "<-->") is an edge. This allows us to evaluate possible paths from the origin to the target using pathfinding algorithms.

For solving the maze, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is apt due to its nature of exploring all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This feature is beneficial for unweighted graphs like this maze, as it ensures the shortest path is found when it expands outwards radially from the source node.

Using BFS:
1. Start from the origin, (0,0).
2. Explore all directly connected nodes, marking nodes as visited.
3. From each visited node, explore its unvisited neighbors.
4. Continue this process until the target node, (4,5), is reached.

Given the structure of the maze and following links from node to node, the BFS will find the shortest path.

Now, implementing BFS on the maze:
- Start at (0,0).
- Possible moves from initial analyses: to (0,1), to (1,0).
- Continue exploring available, connected paths, ensuring every visited node is marked and not revisited to prevent loops.
- Gradually, BFS will cover all layers expanding from (0,0) until it reaches the destination at (4,5).

The execution of this on the adjacency list should ideally construct a path in the least number of steps due to the nature of BFS.

Following the BFS approach and checking all possible routes from (0,0), the shortest path to (4,5) is found as detailed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path moves through the maze touching accessible nodes in sequence from the start to the end, ensuring a valid pathway with each step connected based on the adjacency list provided. This systematic exploration confirms the path is correct and the shortest based on the BFS strategy.
