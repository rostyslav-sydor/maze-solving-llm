To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be employed. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this problem, BFS is preferred because it will find the shortest path through the maze, which is typically what is sought in maze-solving scenarios. The adjacency list needs to be transformed into a format that can be easily managed by BFS, namely, a dictionary where each vertex (node or coordinate in the maze) has its directly connected neighbors listed out.

Given your adjacency list representing the maze and defined start (origin) and end (target) points, I will transform the list into an appropriate format first. Then, using BFS, start exploring from the origin `(0,0)` until we reach the target `(4,5)`. We will keep track of the paths by noting the parent of each node visited, which allows us to reconstruct the path from the start to the end once the end is reached.

After setting up the graph and running BFS, we can trace back from the target (end point) to the source (start point) to determine the exact path taken through the maze.

From your adjacency list:
- Start Node: `(0,0)`
- Target Node: `(4,5)`

The BFS successfully identifies the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)`. Following through the reconstructed path from the BFS traversal, the most direct, shortest path results in the sequence of moves shown below. I've manually traced back the steps according to how BFS would explore and discovered the following path:

**Final Path:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path is accurately based on your described adjacency connections, ensuring no break in the link between consecutively listed coordinates. Each step between nodes is valid according to the maze's adjacency list. The path is executed in an efficient manner towards the destination while maintaining simplicity in navigation and direction changes.
