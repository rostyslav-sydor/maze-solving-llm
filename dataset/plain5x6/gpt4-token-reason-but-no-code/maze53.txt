To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list, we need to define a pathway from the given origin (entry point) to the target (exit point) based on the connectivity of the cells (vertices) as provided in the list. In this scenario, we traverse from (0,0) to (4,5).

We can approach this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS), a well-known graph traversal algorithm often used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. The BFS explores the vertices layer by layer from the source and ensures that once a vertex is reached, it will not be revisited, efficiently finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.

Given the connections amongst the coordinates as an adjacency list, let's compute the BFS traversal from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5) using a queue:

1. Starting from (0,0), we add it to the queue.
2. For each node, we check and enqueue all its adjacent nodes and track the path traversed using a predecessor array or dictionary.
3. As BFS progresses, it explores all reachable vertices level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.
4. Upon reaching the target node (4,5), we can trace back from this node to the origin using the recorded paths to reconstruct the path.

Based on the BFS algorithm application to the adjacency list provided:

Starting from (0,0), we can explore and eventually find a route to (4,5) by continuously moving through adjacent vertices that directly connect through the paths described.

Calculating path using the adjacency list provided and formulating the shortest path based on BFS processing:

**Path:**
- Start at the origin (0,0) and explore the maze via connections.
- Move from (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) using straight forward connections.
- Transition next via (0,3) -> (1,3).
- Continue path via (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) then (2,4) -> (2,5)
- Move from (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)
- Finally reach the target by moving from (4,4) -> (4,5)

We ensure every single movement is indeed possible from the adjacency list mentioned.

Thus, the specific solution path is:  
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
