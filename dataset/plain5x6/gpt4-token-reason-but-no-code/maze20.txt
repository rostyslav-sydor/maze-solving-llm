To solve the maze presented, we can use breadth-first search (BFS), which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's why BFS is suitable:

- **Unweighted Graph**: The connections between nodes (maze cells) do not have weights, only indicating whether a direct path exists or not, making BFS perfect since it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Shortest Path**: BFS guarantees that we first discover any node at the shortest path available from a source due to its level-wise expansion.

**Steps to solve the maze using BFS**:
1. **Representation**: Convert the adjacency list into a usable form for BFS, typically an adjacency list where each node contains a list of connected nodes.
2. **Queue Initialization**: Start the BFS with the queue initialized to include the origin node (in this case, (0,0)).
3. **Visited Set**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.
4. **Processing Nodes**: Dequeue a node, check if it's the target; if not, enqueue its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.
5. **Path Reconstruction**: Store the parent for each node (track how we reached each node). When the target is reached, backtrack using this parentage info to reconstruct the path.

Applying these steps for the given maze, the transition from the initial node (0,0) to the target node (4,5) using BFS would explore nodes layer by layer until the target is found. Given the adjacency relationships and starting and ending points, let's identify the shortest path.

Given the labyrinth pathways and the BFS search strategy, following the connections from (0,0) to (4,5), one of the shortest paths found by BFS is:

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5)

This path optimally connects the start and end points through the available passages without any backtracking or unnecessary detours, satisfying the conditions for the shortest path due to the layer-by-layer exploration of BFS.

Therefore, the solution in the specified format is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
