To solve this maze, we first transform the adjacency list into a usable map of node connections and then apply a graph traversal algorithm (BFS or DFS) to find the path from the starting point to the target.

The adjacency list provided gives us pairs of connections, for example, `(1,4) <--> (1,3)` means that from coordinate (1,4), one can move to (1,3) and vice versa. We systematically transform the entire adjacency list into a format usable by a graph traversal algorithm.

**Steps to solve the maze**:
1. **Assemble Graph**: Structure all connections from the adjacency list into a graph data structure where each node corresponds to a coordinate, and edges represent direct passages between coordinates.

2. **Choose Algorithm (BFS or DFS)**: For this maze, BFS is selected for it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which makes sense for a maze where each move to an adjacent node has the same cost or weight.

3. **Graph Traversal**: Start from the entry point (0,0) and explore the graph using BFS, marking each visited node and keeping track of the path taken. This process continues until we either exhaust all possibilities or find the exit (4,5). If maze completion is feasible, the BFS will find the shortest path.

4. **Compile Path**: As we traverse using BFS, we keep a record of how we reach each node so that once we find the exit point, we can backtrack from the exit to the origin, collecting the coordinates of the path.

Upon applying the above steps to the graph built from the adjacency list and the start and end points provided, we process the maze and find the following solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

**Explanation**: Starting from (0,0), move right across the row to (0,2) going through (0,1). From (0,2), move downwards to (1,2) and continue to (1,3) and then to (2,3). Proceed downward to (3,3) and then to (4,3). From (4,3), move right to (4,4), then finally to (4,5).

This path is efficient and indeed likely the shortest given the layout and connections particular to this maze configuration.
