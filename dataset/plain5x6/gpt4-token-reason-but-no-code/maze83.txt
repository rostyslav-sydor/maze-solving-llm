The maze provided in the adjacency list format defines which cells in a grid are directly connected to each other, creating pathways that must be followed from a designated start point to an end point. The challenge is to find a path from the start coordinate `(0,0)` to the target coordinate `(4,5)` navigating through the connections specified.

Analyzing the adjacency list, we can understand that each coordinate pair lists permissible movements from one cell to another. By following an approach similar to breadth-first search (BFS), where each accessible neighbour is visited level by level, you can efficiently find the shortest path from the start to the target. BFS is suitable here as it explores all neighbours at the present depth prior to moving on to cells at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid like this maze.

Applying BFS:
1. From the entry `(0,0)`, look at all connectable nodes.
2. Move sequentially, exploring all neighbour nodes at each step.
3. Track visited nodes to avoid cycles and re-visiting.
4. Continue until the exit `(4,5)` is reached.

Using the BFS approach and following the connections defined in your adjacency list, the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` with recorded transitions through permissible nodes can be determined.

Upon calculating by going through different possibilities and paths allowed by the adjacency list, the path from start to finish navigating through the nodes allowed is found to be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path traverses the grid from the left-most column to the right-most grid at the bottom row, using permitted movements as mentioned in the adjacency list provided.
