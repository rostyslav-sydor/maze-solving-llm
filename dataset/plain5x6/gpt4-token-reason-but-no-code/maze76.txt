To find a solution to the maze represented in the adjacency list, the key is to traverse the graph from the origin to the target point using a pathfinding algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). For such a grid-based maze:

1. **Latitude in Selection**: DFS would allow exploring a path deeply before backtracking, which might not always yield the shortest path but will explore potential paths thoroughly. BFS, on the other hand, explores neighbors level by level and tends to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid, like this maze, where each step has the same 'cost'.

2. **Adjacency List Interpretation**: The data indicates all directly connected coordinates, implying each pair can be traversed bidirectionally.

3. **Graph Representation**: Each coordinate pair shows a connection, which can be represented in a dictionary with each key as a coordinate and its values being the coordinates it directly connects to.

4. **Search Approach**: Using BFS:
   - Start at the origin (0,0).
   - Use a queue to manage visited nodes while ensuring all direct neighbors are checked before moving further.
   - Track paths: Keep a dictionary marking each visited node and the node it was reached from.

**Path Recovery**: Once the target is found, derive the path by backtracking from the target (4,5) using the dictionary that tracked the node connections during BFS.

**Execution and Output**:
Given the structure and methodology, let us step through BFS:

- Start from (0,0), visit all its neighbors (adding to the queue): (1, 0), (0, 1).
- Next, keep visiting neighbors of all queued items level by level, pushing each unvisited neighbor into the queue and recording the path, until (4,5), the target, is reached.
- By the read connectivity, a path from (0,0) to (4,5) includes the necessary steps and turns derived from BFS:

Considering the adjacency relationships and the characteristics of BFS which explores the shortest pathways first in such unweighted mazes, your output for the maze specified would be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
