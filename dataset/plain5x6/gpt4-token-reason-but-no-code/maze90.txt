To solve the given maze, we need to identify a path from the specified origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5) using the provided adjacency list that describes the maze's connectivity between cells.

Firstly, we interpret the adjacency list:
- Each pair, such as `(1,2) <--> (2,2)`, indicates that those two cells are directly connected, meaning one can move directly between them.
  
Next, we utilize a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) because of its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, like this maze where each step from one cell to its adjacent counts uniformly. BFS will explore the nearest nodes first before moving to further distances which is particularly beneficial for maze navigation.

From the starting point (0,0):
1. Explore all directly reachable nodes.
2. Mark each explored node to avoid re-exploration and keep track of the path.
3. Continue exploring until the target (4,5) is reached.

Given the complexity of manually tracing BFS on text, I have determined the shortest path by logically following possible paths using the adjacency list and checking direct connectivity.

Applying this insight, hereâ€™s how the path looks in solving the maze:

- Start at (0,0).
- Move to (1,0) allowed by `(0,0) <--> (1,0)`.
- Continue to (1,1) via `(1,0) <--> (1,1)`.
- Progress to (2,1) through `(1,1) <--> (2,1)`.
- Move to (2,2) using `(2,1) <--> (2,2)`.
- Proceed to (2,3) via `(2,2) <--> (2,3)`.
- Go to (3,3) by `(2,3) <--> (3,3)`.
- Continue to (4,3) through `(3,3) <--> (4,3)`.
- Move to (4,4) by following `(4,3) <--> (4,4)`.
- Finally, reach the target (4,5) using `(4,4) <--> (4,5)`.

Thus, the specific solution for this maze, in terms of the visited nodes from origin to target, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path uses BFS-like exploration through logical connection deductions within the maze's configuration from its adjacency list, ensuring the shortest and valid path is selected.
