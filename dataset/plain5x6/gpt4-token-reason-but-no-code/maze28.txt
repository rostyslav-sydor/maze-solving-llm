To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list above, we identify a path between the origin `(0,0)` and the target `(4,5)`. Our approach involves tracing connected nodes, essentially employing a graph traversal technique such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the route from the start to the end.

Here's an analysis of the process leading to the solution:

1. **Understanding the Graph Representation:**
   - Each pair of coordinates in the adjacency list indicates a direct pathway between the two points in the maze.

2. **Starting at the Origin:**
   - The maze begins at `(0,0)`, and we need to find our way to `(4,5)`.

3. **Tracing a Feasible Path:**
   - From `(0,0)` we can move to `(0,1)` as per the adjacency `(0,0) <--> (0,1)`.
   - Continuing in this manner, following the links between adjacent nodes, search the pathway that eventually leads us to our target `(4,5)`.

4. **Avoiding Loops and Dead Ends:**
   - During this traversal, careful attention is paid to avoid revisiting nodes excessively, as loops can make solving inefficient.

5. **Final Path Construction:**
   - Upon reaching `(4,5)`, we backtrack to ensure the path chosen is indeed valid from start to end, making adjustments if necessary while referencing the adjacency list.

By applying this approach to the given adjacency list and navigating through connected nodes reliably, we are able to deduce a sequence of moves from the origin to the destination. Here is the resulting successful path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This pathway proves straightforward following the easterly and northerly links in the adjacency dataset. No loops or unnecessary retracing occur in this solution, illustrating an efficient path from the maze's start to its finish point.
