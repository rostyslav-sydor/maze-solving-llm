To find a solution to the maze given in the adjacency list format, we need to identify a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5) using the connections provided between the coordinates.

The adjacency list provides direct connections between neighboring points of the maze, essentially showing all possible paths one can take at each point or intersection. To solve the maze, a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be employed because these algorithms are well-suited to exploring all possible paths/connections and finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one. Since the maze uses coordinates to represent vertices and direct pairings to show edges, we can treat it as an unweighted graph.

By analyzing the adjacency list, we can map out the neighbors for each node (or coordinate). Using BFS, we start at the origin (0,0), check each of its neighbors, and move through the maze level by level, checking each reachable coordinate until we arrive at the exit (4,5). This method guarantees that the shortest path is found due to the nature of BFS which explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Now, based on the given maze connections and using BFS from (0,0) to (4,5), we can trace the shortest path and represent it in the requested format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

Explanation:
- Starts at (0,0).
- Goes to the right incrementally until it hits (0,3).
- Moves upward to (1,3), leveraging connections that move vertically through coordinates.
- Progresses further through connected vertical points reaching (1,4), continues from (2,4) to (2,5).
- Finally, crosses from the third layer from (3,5) to (3,4), ends up from (4,4) to (4,5).
Each movement adheres to the adjacency conditions provided, illustrating clear, reliable paths according to the adjacency restrictions and ensuring a solution is found considering all given connections.
