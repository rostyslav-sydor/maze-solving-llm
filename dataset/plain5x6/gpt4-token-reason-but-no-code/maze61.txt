The maze is structured as a grid with adjacency list defining the possible paths between neighboring nodes (coordinates). To find a solution, we have to trace a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (4,5) using the connections given.

By analyzing the provided maze structure, we can trace the shortest pathway based on directly connected nodes:

1. Start from the origin (0,0), which can follow to (1,0) as (1,0) is connected to (0,0).
2. Proceed from (1,0) to (2,0), because (2,0) is connected to (1,0).
3. From (2,0), move to (2,1) based on the adjacency list.
4. Continue from (2,1) to (2,2) following their connection.
5. Move from (2,2) to (2,3) and subsequently to (2,4), utilizing the connectivity between them.
6. From (2,4) go to (2,5) which can connect directly to (3,5), and then to (4,5), the final target.

This pathway moves sequentially through connected nodes on the same columns before advancing to the next, simplifying traversal. It avoids detours and uses a direct vertical path when moving from the bottom to the top of the grid columns, maximizing efficiency. The chosen path also does not backtrack or branch unnecessarily, providing an optimal or near-optimal route.

Therefore, the proposed solution, using only the paths allowed by the adjacency list and maintaining a systematic approach (primarily moving vertically unless impossible), is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
