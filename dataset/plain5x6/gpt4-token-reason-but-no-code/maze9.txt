To solve the maze, we first need to understand the structures given:

1. **Adjacency List**: This represents how various points (coordinates) in the maze are connected. Each pair `(a, b) <--> (c, d)` indicates a direct path between point `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`.
2. **Origin**: This is the starting point of the maze `(0,0)`.
3. **Target**: This is the exit point of the maze `(4,5)`.

With this structure in mind, the optimal strategy to find a route from the origin to the target is by using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is effective as it explores all possible moves level by level outward from the start point, ensuring that it finds the shortest path to the target.

### Steps for Solving the Maze Using BFS:
1. **Initialize** with a queue starting at the origin `(0,0)`, and maintain a set for visited nodes to avoid cycles.
2. Expand nodes in the order they are encountered, exploring all direct neighbors based on the adjacency list.
3. For each node, check if itâ€™s the target `(4,5)`. If so, backtrack to find the path taken to get there.
4. If not, move to the next node and repeat until the target is found.

### Backtracking to retrieve the path:
Once the target is reached, as per BFS procedure, you backtrack from the target node to the origin using the recorded path of nodes taken. This gives you the sequence of moves (or coordinates) from start to the end.

### Solution:
Now, applying the above logic and information given in the formatted adjacency list, we trace out the sequence of coordinates from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)`.

- Begin at `(0,0)`
- Traverse to `(1,0)`
- Move to `(2,0)`
- Go to `(3,0)`
- Follow through to `(4,0)`
- Proceed to `(4,1)`
- Navigate to `(4,2)` 
- Continue to `(4,3)`
- Then move to `(4,4)`
- Finally, go to `(4,5)`; the exit.

### Output in the Given Format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path has been formulated based on the connectivity outlined in the adjacency list and ensures travel across all necessary points without revisiting any location, making it a valid solution for the maze as described.
