To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, the reasoning involved determining a path from the defined origin (0,0) to the target (4,5) using the connections provided. The maze is unequally weighted and undirected since each path segment allows for movement either way between connected nodes.

The adjacency list itself details which coordinates (points in the maze) are directly connected to each other. To find a path from the origin to the target, we effectively need to follow these connections, navigating through the nodes such that we reach the target from the origin. The standard approach is to use a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) which is known for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

For this adjacency list, we'll utilize the BFS approach, considering the origin (0,0) as the starting node. We start at this node, explore all connected nodes (connected as per adjacency list), and thereafter explore nodes connected to those nodes until the target (4,5) is reached or all possible paths are exhausted. BFS uses a queue to manage the nodes exploration order, and typically employs marking or flagging to track visited nodes to avoid revisiting and infinite loops.

Implementing BFS on the provided maze as per its adjacency list:
- Start at (0,0)
- Move sequentially through reachable nodes, following the paths available in the adjacency list.
- Continue this step-by-step exploration until reaching (4,5).

After completing the BFS and tracing back the path from the target to the origin using the recorded nodes' predecessors (standard part of BFS to keep track of the path), we can formulate the appropriate path sequence.

The specific solution found for this maze using BFS and examining the provided adjacency list results in the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path describes moving straight down the bottom row, then climbing up aside the last column to the target. This is one of possibly multiple valid solutions depending on the algorithm specifics and implementation details such as the order of exploring equally preferable path options.
