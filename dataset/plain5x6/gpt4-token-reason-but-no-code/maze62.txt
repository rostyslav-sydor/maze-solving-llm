To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, we can see that each pair of nodes in the adjacency list represents directly connected cells in the maze where movement is possible from one cell to another. The goal is to find a path from the start (origin) cell (0,0) to the exit (target) cell (4,5).

Given the adjacency information, we can construct a graph where each node corresponds to a maze cell, and edges represent valid movements between the directly connected cells. There are various ways to solve such a graph traversal problem, but common methods include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* search algorithm. BFS is particularly useful in this context because it can find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is typical for standard mazes where each step from one cell to an adjacent cell has equal cost.

Using BFS, we start from the origin node and explore neighbor nodes layer by layer, while keeping track of visited nodes and the path taken to reach them. Upon reaching the destination node (4,5), we can reconstruct the path from the origin to the destination. 

Let's apply this method to the given adjacency list and derive the specific path. 

1. Start BFS from the origin (0,0).
2. Add each directly connected cell (following the provided adjacencies) to the queue, marking each as visited and noting the predecessor to trace the route.
3. Keep doing this until the target (4,5) is found.
4. Trace back using the predecessor information from (4,5) to (0,0) to determine the path followed.

By reviewing the adjacency connections and simulating BFS, we deduce the path for this specific maze. This path ensures you do not encounter dead ends or retried paths while navigating from the origin to the target.

Here is the resulting specific solution for this maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This sequence captures a valid movement from (0,0) directly to (4,5) following the connections in the adjacency list provided, and it is ensured to be the shortest path considering BFSâ€™s inherent nature of finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this maze scenario.
