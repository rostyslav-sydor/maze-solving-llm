To solve the maze given as an adjacency list, it's necessary to understand the graph representation of the maze. Each pair of coordinates connected by "<-->" represents a pathway in the maze where one can move from one coordinate to the other directly without any barriers. The objective is to find a path from the origin (entry point) marked by `<ORIGIN_START> (0,0) <ORIGIN_END>` to the target (exit point) marked by `<TARGET_START> (4,5) <TARGET_END>`, moving through the connections specified in the adjacency list.

Given the format, we can utilize graph traversal techniques, like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or even Dijkstra's algorithm for more complex weighted paths. However, BFS is well-suited for unweighted graphs, as it explores all adjacent vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This nature ensures the shortest path in an unweighted scenario such as ours.

Here, the BFS approach explores all possible paths from the origin and keeps track of each vertex's predecessor. This allows us to reconstruct the path from the origin to the target once the target is reached during BFS.

Steps in the reasoning are:
1. **Initialization**: Start at the origin `(0,0)`, initializing a queue with this vertex and mark it as visited.
2. **Exploration**: Dequeue vertex, inspect all its neighbors (as per the adjacency list), enqueue any unvisited neighbors, and mark them as visited.
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target `(4,5)` is reached, backtrace from the target to the origin using the recorded predecessors, creating the path list.

Applying this reasoning, we interpret the adjacency list provided and incrementally explore from `(0,0)`. The target `(4,5)` is reached by sequentially moving through the available paths. 

Here is the path found using such reasoning:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This sequence is based on the BFS algorithm and connects only adjacent cells (no jumps across non-adjacent cells), preserving the valid path constraints given by the edges in the adjacency list. This ensures it's an accurate and valid solution to the maze presented, and since BFS was used, it's also one of the shortest paths from the origin to the target.
