The maze described above is a connected set of corridors where each corridor gets represented by a pair of coordinates indicating accessible positions between two adjacent cells. The task here is to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (4,5) through these connected corridors.

To solve this maze, I would view the problem as a search in a graph where each node (vertex) is a position in the maze (as a coordinate pair) and each edge between two nodes indicates that you can move directly between these two positions. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) would be practical as BFS ensures the shortest path in an unweighted graph, and DFS would explore all possible paths.

Given the adjacency list format, a BFS algorithm has been used to traverse this graph efficiently by exploring all adjacent nodes (connected positions) from each point in an orderly and level-wise manner until we reach the target. The BFS algorithm will utilize a queue to manage the nodes for exploration and a mechanism to keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops and unnecessary traversal.

By logically following the connections given and starting from the origin coordinate (0,0), exploring all reachable neighbors, noting each step, and following the BFS, the path from start to end in the maze can be traced.

Upon analysis and step-by-step tracing using the BFS method described, the series of movements from (0,0) to (4,5) has been found to be as followed:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path sequentially connects adjacent nodes from the start to the endpoint, adhering to the connections provided in the adjacency list, while ensuring the BFS exploration method is accurately depicted.
