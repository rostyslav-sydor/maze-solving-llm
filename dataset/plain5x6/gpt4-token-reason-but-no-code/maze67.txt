To find the solution to the maze provided, it is best to first interpret the given adjacency list into a more clear representation like a graph where nodes are coordinates and edges represent paths between them. By using the adjacency list, we can understand how each pair of nodes (or coordinates) is connected. This is essential in building the graph structure which we will use to traverse the maze.

Once the graph is constructed using these edges, we can then employ a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node. BFS is chosen because it works well in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like our maze, where each edge has equal weight or cost. 

The BFS explores neighbors level by level, ensuring that once we reach the target, it is through the shortest path possible. In BFS, reachable nodes are kept in a queue. Every node explored is marked or set apart to avoid processing a node more than once, and to track back the path from the target to the start once the target is reached.

Given the maze setup:
- Entry Point : (0,0)
- Exit Point : (4,5)
Considering the adjacency relationships defined in the list, we perform BFS starting from (0,0) until we reach (4,5). The adjacency relationships form direct connections like a direct path from (0,0) -> (0,1) and so on.

Following BFS and tracking parent nodes to recover the path once we reach (4,5), Iâ€™ve derived the sequence of movements from the start to the end. Here is the path obtained through BFS traversal of the graph from the provided maze data:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path is guaranteed to be one of the shortest paths from the entry to the exit of the maze due to the nature of the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
