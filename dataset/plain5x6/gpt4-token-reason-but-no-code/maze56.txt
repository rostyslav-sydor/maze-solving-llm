To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we must establish a path from the designated origin coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (4,5). The adjacency list provides direct connections between coordinates, constituting the edges of a graph where each coordinate is a node.

The task at hand involves finding an efficient route between the starting and ending points. A common algorithm suitable for this kind of problem is the Breadth-First Search (BFS), ideal for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs like mazes. The BFS procedure explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It will systematically explore the maze's paths and can be halted once it reaches the target coordinate.

Using the BFS in this context, the solution proceeds as:
1. Initiate BFS at the start node (0,0).
2. Explore all adjacent nodes from current nodes, marking nodes as visited and tracking the path.
3. Continue exploration until the target node (4,5) is encountered.
4. Trace back from the target node to the start node to determine the path taken.

After applying BFS and tracing through the given maze using adjacency relations in the list, the optimal path found through BFS from (0,0) to (4,5) is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This BFS-derived path progresses from the starting point directly down to the last row across right, providing a systematic movement around obstacles as deciphered from the adjacency list. This solution efficiently reaches the end point without retracing any steps unnecessarily.
