To solve the maze problem given in the adjacency list representation, we need to find a path connecting the designated origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5). The adjacency entries represent which points (cells in the maze) are directly connected to each other, meaning that one can move between them without any intervening walls or barriers.

Starting from the origin, explore the neighboring connected nodes using a suitable graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is chosen here as it ensures finding the shortest path from the origin to the target in an unweighted grid like this, since BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Applying a BFS traversal to this adjacency list:

1. Start at (0,0), enqueue it.
2. Visit every node that (0,0) is connected to, which includes (0,1). Enqueue (0,1).
3. From (0,1), we can go to (0,2) and (1,1). Enqueue these nodes.
4. Continue this process: mark each node as visited when it is dequeued and check all its neighbors. If a neighbor is the target point (4,5), end the BFS and trace back the path from (4,5) to (0,0).
5. If not reaching the target early, continue exploring until all possible paths are checked or until the target is found.

Tracing and tracking the path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5) following the connections provided, and applying the BFS approach, leads to the shortest path found as follows:

- Start from (0,0), then to (0,1), proceed to (0,2), then to (0,3) and next to (0,4).
- Move from (0,4) to (0,5), then to (1,5) and proceed to (2,5).
- Then, move from (2,5) to (3,5), and finally reach the target at (4,5).

This path navigates through the maze considering all available movements between the directly connected points as provided in the adjacency list.

Here's the resulting path in the specified format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This solution provides the shortest route to navigate the maze from the entry to the exit, using the breadth-first search technique, as detailed through this adjacency representation of the maze.
