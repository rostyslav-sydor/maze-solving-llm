To solve this maze problem, I analyzed the provided adjacency list to understand the connectivity of each cell (node) in the graph. The adjacency list essentially maps out the pathways between different cells in a grid-like structure. By interpreting the adjacency list, I determined how each node is connected to its neighbors.

To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5), I considered using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is commonly used for maze-solving problems because it explores all possible paths level by level. This ensures that the shortest path is found when the target is reached for the first time.

Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS will explore its neighboring nodes, and from each of those, it will explore their neighboring nodes, and so on. The exploration continues until the target (4,5) is found. During exploration, BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored, and each node is marked as visited as it's queued to prevent re-visiting and forming loops.

Based on the adjacency list, here's a traced path to solving the maze from (0,0) to (4,5):

1. From (0,0), the adjacent node is (1,0).
2. From (1,0), we can move to (2,0).
3. From (2,0), the next node is (3,0).
4. Move from (3,0) to (4,0).
5. From (4,0), proceed to (4,1).
6. Then from (4,1), go to (4,2).
7. Continue from (4,2) to (4,3).
8. From (4,3), can move next to (4,4).
9. Finally from (4,4), reach the destination (4,5).

This series of movements provides a pathway through the maze, leveraging the connectivity provided by the adjacency list, ensuring at each step that we advance toward the final destination using the shortest possible route found by BFS.

Thus, the specific solution in the requested format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
