To solve this maze, I am analyzing the provided adjacency list that defines the maze's connectivity between various points, then finding a path from the specified origin to the target.

The adjacency list presents the maze as a graph where each node is a coordinate pair representing a position in the maze, and each edge shows direct connectivity between two positions (nodes). Given the marked origin of (0,0) and the target of (4,5), the goal is to find a path between these nodes.

To determine a path:
1. **Explore Connections:** Understand which points are connected directly.
2. **Path-Finding Algorithm:** Utilize a classic path-finding algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to traverse the maze from origin to target, respecting the connections given in the adjacency list.
3. **Trace the Path:** Having found a viable route using said algorithm, trace back the visited nodes to delineate the complete path from origin to the target.

Using the adjacency list you provided and applying a breadth-first search (BFS) method appears efficient since it explores all nearest possibilities first and is generally simpler in terms of keeping track of paths.

Let's simulate a BFS on the provided list to find the shortest path:
- Starting from (0,0), explore adjacent nodes.
- Refer to adjacency list to find and traverse connections.
- Check every next available node until we reach (4,5).

Given the connections, let's sketch a possible shortest path:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. From (0,0) you can move to (1,0) because there is a path (0,0) <--> (1,0).
3. From (1,0), move to (2,0) as per (1,0) <--> (2,0).
4. Proceed from (2,0) to (2,1) using (2,1) <--> (2,0).
5. Move to (3,1) through (3,1) <--> (2,1).
6. Continue to (3,2) via (3,1) <--> (3,2).
7. Navigate to (4,2) utilizing (4,2) <--> (3,2).
8. From (4,2), move directly to (4,3) because of the connection (4,3) <--> (4,2).
9. Advance to (4,4) shown by (4,4) <--> (4,3).
10. Finally, go from (4,4) to (4,5) via the link (4,5) <--> (4,4).

Summarizing:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This series of movements takes you from the origin to the target while respecting the maze's path constraints efficiently.
