The maze given in the problem is represented as an adjacency list for a graph, where nodes are coordinate points and edges represent pathways between these coordinates. The adjacency list provides the connections between each pair of directly adjacent points.

The objective is to find a path from the origin, (0,0), to the target, (4,5). A common approach to solve this type of problem, where all edges in a graph have the same weight, is by using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores the graph level by level from the start node, and has the advantage of always finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here's a step-by-step exploration starting from the origin (0,0), assuming we're utilizing BFS:
1. First, visit all points directly connected to (0,0).
2. From each new point, explore all other directly connected points that haven't been visited yet.
3. Continue this exploration until the target point (4,5) is reached.

Following the adjacency list provided and using BFS starting at (0,0), we can systematically explore nodes and maintain a track of the path using parent pointers (or a similar strategy), which guide us back from the target node to the origin once the target is found.

After working through the list and systematically applying BFS, we find the required route to be as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path is confirmed by traversing through the coordinate connections in the adjacency list, ensuring at each step that a direct connection exists, building our path incrementally as these connections are validated.
