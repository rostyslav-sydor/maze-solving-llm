For the given adjacency list of the maze, the goal is to determine a viable path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (4,5). We will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

BFS works well here because it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Thus, it guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph. For this problem, we initiate BFS from the source point (0,0), exploring all possible moves based on direct adjacency, and track the path using a queue for systematic exploration and a previous-node map for path reconstruction.

Following the BFS and path reconstruction procedure results in determining the minimum path from the source to the destination in the context of given maze adjacency:

1. We begin at (0,0), from where based on our adjacency which straightforwardly connects to (0,1), then to (0,2).
2. Continue moving in a feasible direction with connectivity from our current location. From (0,2), go to (0,3), then (0,4).
3. From (0,4), proceed to (0,5), and then to (1,5) since these are directly connected.
4. From (1,5), we can move to (1,4), then consecutively to (1,3), from which we can connect based on the adjacency to (2,3).
5. From (2,3), move to (3,3), then to (4,3) according to connected nodes.
6. From (4,3), we move to (4,4) and finally reach (4,5).

Thus, based on the BFS pathfinding from the adjacency list provided, the shortest path from (0,0) to (4,5) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (1,4) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path maps directly from the origin given in the prompt to the target using BFS to ensure itâ€™s the shortest available route considered by exploring levels and marking visited nodes to prevent redundancy and loops.
