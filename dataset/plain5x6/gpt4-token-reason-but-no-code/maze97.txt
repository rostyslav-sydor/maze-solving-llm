To solve this maze, we can implement a typical search algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the path from the origin to the target node. Here's the reasoning and solution:

1. **Understanding the Maze Layout**: The maze is defined in its entirety between `<ADJLIST_START>` and `<ADJLIST_END>`, showing every pair of cells (nodes) that are directly connected (adjacent) to each other. We can interpret each coordinate pair as a vertex within a graph.

2. **Identifying Start and End Points**: The origin of the maze is given between `<ORIGIN_START>` and `<ORIGIN_END>` tokens as (0,0), and the target (end) of the maze is specified between `<TARGET_START>` and `<TARGET_END>` tokens as (4,5).

3. **Building the Graph**: Utilize the adjacency list provided to establish the connections between nodes, ensuring that traversal between connected nodes can be accomplished. 

4. **Selecting an Algorithm**: Implement the BFS, famed for its optimal performance in unweighted graphs like this to ensure the shortest path in terms of edge count. In BFS, we start at the root (or origin point), exploring all its neighbors at the present "depth" prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

5. **Executing BFS on the Maze**: Starting from (0,0):
   - Explore all directly connected nodes, then move to the next level of nodes that those nodes connect to, systematically until the destination (4,5) is reached.
   - BFS guarantees that the first time we reach the target node, it's through the shortest path available due to its level-by-level exploration technique.

6. **Trace the Path from Origin to Destination**: As BFS proceeds, typically, we maintain a structure (a map or a list) that can help trace back the path from the target node to the origin node once the target is reached.

The BFS traversal on this adjacency list, starting from (0,0) and aiming for (4,5), and considering the structure and connections given, would get us the shortest path in the maze. Let's illustrate that path:

After computing (either manually for small graphs or programmatically for extensive ones), we find that the shortest path from (0,0) to (4,5) in this specific maze configuration is:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
```

This sequence represents the nodes visited, in order, from the maze's entry point to its exit, traversing through the entirety of the "zero" row and progressively climbing down the last column (column 5) of the maze graph to reach the target. This path exploits straight movements along zeroth row and a vertical descent from row 1 to row 4 at the last column, embodying BFSâ€™s characteristic of exploring all neighboring nodes (in this context, neighboring cells in a row or a column) before progressing.
