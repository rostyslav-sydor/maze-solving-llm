In the provided adjacency list, each pair of coordinates represents passages between adjacent points in the maze. To find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (4,5), I will use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. These algorithms are suitable for exploring all possible paths from a starting node until the target node is found, utilizing the structure of the graph defined by the adjacency list.

Starting at (0,0), our goal is to find a sequence of adjacent coordinates leading to (4,5). Since we have all direct neighbor connections given, we can iteratively explore each neighbor, marking visited nodes, and backtracking if a path leads to a dead-end.

Here's the solution found using such a search on the adjacency list:
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move to adjacent node (0,1).
3. Continue to (0,2).
4. Move vertically to (0,3).
5. Move vertically to (0,4).
6. Move diagonally to (1,4) via (1,4) <--> (0,4).
7. Move to (2,4) via (1,4) <--> (2,4).
8. Use (2,5) via (2,4) <--> (2,5).
9. Move to (3,5) via (2,5) <--> (3,5).
10. Finally, reach (4,5) via (3,5) <--> (4,5).

This path connects each point through valid adjacent points as per the adjacency list provided.

Resulting path:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
