The problem requires finding a path through the maze from an entry point to an exit point. The maze is represented as an adjacency list, which is a common way to describe a graph. Each node in the graph represents a point in the maze, and each edge indicates a direct pathway from one point to another. The adjacency list data provides all possible direct movements between neighboring points in the maze.

To solve the maze:

1. **Graph Representation:** First, interpret the adjacency list to understand all possible movements in the maze. Each entry like `(A) <--> (B)` means thereâ€™s a pathway between point A and point B.

2. **Entry and Exit Points:** Identify the coordinates marked as the origin `(0,0)` and the target `(4,5)`.

3. **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement a graph search algorithm that explores paths from the entry point to the exit. Common algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* search. BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted grids like this one because it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.

4. **Execution:** Execute the chosen algorithm using the graph's data structure built from the adjacency list. Start from the entry point `(0,0)`, explore the neighboring points, and continue until the exit point `(4,5)` is reached while keeping track of the path taken.

5. **Output the Path:** As per the problem statement, output the complete route from the origin to the destination without missing any intermediate steps. Make sure the format adheres to the specified output format.

Based on the adjacency list provided and a properly implemented BFS or a similar shortest path algorithm, the solution path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` through the maze will be represented by nodes connected in the shortest pathway sequence. From the description and adjacency list data provided, the output should reflect the nodes crossed in sequence from start to end.

Now, a BFS would resolve this specific maze in the following path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This sequence essentially reflects how BFS explores level by level, moving from the origin towards nodes that are not yet visited until it reaches the target, while always following the shortest possible path according to the graph structure described by the adjacency list.
