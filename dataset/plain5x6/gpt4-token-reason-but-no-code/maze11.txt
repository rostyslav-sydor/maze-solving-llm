In this scenario, we need to find a path through a maze represented as an undirected graph where vertices are grid coordinates and edges signify direct connections between these coordinates. The starting point ('origin') is (0,0) and the target ('exit') is (4,5).

First, we understand how the adjacency list represents the maze:
- Each pair like (x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2) indicates that you can move directly between these two coordinates.

To solve the maze, a valid approach would be to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. This is because BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. We start from the origin and use BFS until the target node is reached, tracking the path we've taken.

Upon examining the provided adjacency list:
- We parse each pair of connectivity to recognize direct moves.
- Implement BFS keeping a track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
- Employ a queue to manage the current node and its neighbors while maintaining an array or dictionary to store where we came from for each node (to reconstruct the path once we reach the target).

After performing this process for the given maze data, the correct path as determined from (0,0) to (4,5) involves moving step by step directly or indirectly connecting each pair in the shortest manner covering all major movements.

Following this strategy, here is the specific path solution for the maze:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path navigates through the available paths as outlined in the adjacency, ensuring a contiguous route from start to finish in the shortest possible way based on the given connections.
