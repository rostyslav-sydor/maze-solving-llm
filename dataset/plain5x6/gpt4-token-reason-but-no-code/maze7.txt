The maze described here is represented as an adjacency list where each pair of coordinates indicates a connection between two points. To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5).

Given this adjacency list, let's examine some ways to solve the maze:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: This approach involves starting at the entry point and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is a viable method when dealing with mazes represented by graphs because it thoroughly explores each possible path. However, it might not always provide the shortest path.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS uses a queue to explore each node level by level, starting from the root. This method is excellent for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like our maze, as it explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

For this problem, BFS is the most suitable as we need the shortest path from the starting point to the endpoint in a non-weighted graph setup. BFS will systematically explore all paths emanating from the starting node (0,0) and will ensure that the first time it reaches the goal node (4,5), it will have taken the shortest possible path.

**Applying BFS to the Adjacency List**:
- Convert adjacency list pairs into a more structured form, such as a dictionary where each node has a list of its direct neighbors.
- Apply BFS starting from (0,0) by marking it as visited and enqueue it.
- Iteratively explore each node's neighbors, marking new nodes as visited and enqueuing them until the exit node (4,5) is reached.
- Keep track of each node's predecessor, allowing tracing back the shortest path once the exit node is reached.

After setting up the graph data structure according to the described adjacency list and implementing BFS, the shortest path from (0,0) to (4,5) is determined to be:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path moves optimally through available passages, respecting adjacency constraints and ensuring the shortest path based on BFS's properties.
