To find a path through the maze, we start from the origin (0,0) and aim to reach the target (4,5). The adjacency list provided details all possible connections between nodes (coordinates) in the maze, implying which moves are permissible from one point to another.

First, interpret the adjacency list into a usable form that represents the graph structure:
- For every pair "(x1,y1) <--> (x2,y2)", this denotes that from coordinate (x1,y1), you can move directly to (x2,y2) and vice versa.

Using this map, we need to find the sequence of moves that gets us from the start point to the end point efficiently. Typically, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is effective for such tasks in an unweighted grid because it explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This approach will identify the shortest path in a maze structured as an adjacency list, assuming no additional weights or constraints are impacting the edges.

The BFS procedure would start by exploring all neighbors of (0,0), then all their neighbors, and so forth, until (4,5) is reached. However, instead of performing the BFS algorithm here, the solution process assumes this approach and determines a feasible path based on the connections given.

From analyzing the adjacency list and considering how to travel from the origin to the destination optimally (while navigating through connected paths), the sequence of moves can be planned.

Letâ€™s determine the path by searching the adjacency data manually:

1. Starting at (0,0), you can move to (1,0) then to (2,0).
2. From (2,0) to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2).
3. Move from (1,2) to (1,3) to (0,3).
4. Continue from (0,3) to (0,4) then to (0,5).
5. Proceed to (1,5), then to (2,5), then to (3,5).
6. Finally, move from (3,5) to (3,4) to (4,4), then to (4,5).

The chosen path passes through connected nodes as dictated by the adjacency list, ensuring that each subsequent move is legally permissible from the current node's position. This solution successfully navigates from (0,0) to (4,5) by sequentially connecting available paths, respecting the maze's rules.

Therefore, the solution path formatted as specified is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
