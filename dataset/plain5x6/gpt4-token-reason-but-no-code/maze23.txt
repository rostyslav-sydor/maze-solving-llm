To solve this maze, represented as an adjacency list of graph coordinates, we identify the entry point (0,0) and the exit point (4,5). The adjacency list outlines several pairs of coordinates that are directly connected, implying a passage between those points in the maze.

We'll look for a path starting from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5) by exploring available routes from each point, making sure to avoid revisits to coordinates already traversed, to prevent loops or redundant steps. This can be achieved using a breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), or another pathfinding algorithm such as A*. Considering the typical utility of BFS in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, we commence with BFS here.

Using a queue structure for BFS:
1. Start at (0,0), enqueuing it and marking it as visited.
2. For each dequeued node, follow all available adjacent nodes (connections) from our adjacency list that haven't been visited.
3. Continue until reaching the target node (4,5).

Now, applying BFS to the maze's adjacency list:
1. Begin at (0,0) and proceed to its connected nodes (0,1). 
2. From (0,1), move to connected, unvisited nodes (no other direct paths, backtrack to explore other possibilities).
3. Proceed similarly from each node to discover a viable route:

Implementing this strategy leads to discovering the following solution:

From (0,0), you can go to (0,1) and then to (0,2), continuing this pathway through:
- (0,3) and (0,4) after visiting (0,2) and (0,3) respectively.
- From (0,4) move to (1,4) and to (1,5), after which you can transfer to (2,5).
- From (2,5), go to (3,5), and finally, move to the goal at (4,5).

Thus, the complete solution path in the maze from the entry to the exit is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path shows the route from the maze's start point to its end point, following a legitimate traversal of interconnected nodes per the provided adjacency list, while ensuring the journey covers every intricate turn mapped out within the confines of this specific maze configuration.
