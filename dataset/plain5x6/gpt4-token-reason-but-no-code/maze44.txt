To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, a search algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to find a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5). These algorithms are suitable for this task because they systematically explore all possible paths in the maze.

Given the adjacency list, we first reconstruct the graph in a manner that each node (position in the maze) is connected to its adjacent nodes as described by the list. Then, using the BFS approach:

1. Start at the origin node (0,0).
2. Explore all adjacent nodes, i.e., check if there's a direct path to another node.
3. Mark the explored node to avoid revisiting and keep track of the path taken to reach that node.
4. Continue the process until the target node (4,5) is reached.
5. If there's a path to the exit, backtrack from the exit node to the start node to reconstruct the path taken.

In BFS, the first path found is the shortest path under the assumption that each move from one node to another is of equal cost, which suits this context since every step moves from one position to an adjacent position.

Now, for the specific provided maze, using the above methodology, the process of BFS from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5) results in exploring the paths as given in your adjacency list, and the appropriate path from start to end is selected. The BFS ensures that each possible move is checked in layers, from those closest to the start moving outward, which ensures finding the shortest route in an unweighted graph such as this one.

Hence, for the specific maze presented, the path is computed as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

In this path:
- We begin at (0,0) and move right and up through (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).
- We then progressively move through the third column from (1,3) to (2,3) then (3,3).
- Finally, shift to the right side of the maze ending up from (4,3) to (4,4) and eventually to the exit at (4,5).
