The solution for this maze, as outlined from the adjacency list provided, involves finding a path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5). Given the adjacency relationships, we aim to traverse through connected coordinates until the target is reached. We look for an optimal route without retracing steps excessively, using valid direct connections between points mentioned in the adjacency list.

Starting from (0,0), we have a connection to (0,1), and from (0,1), there's a connection to (0,2). At (0,2), we can move to (0,3), and then advance to (0,4). Heading from (0,4) to (0,5), there are no direct links to move directly down the column starting from (0,0) to the exit on column 5, so an alternative route needs traversing.

From (0,4), connected directly to (1,4), we can travel down using connections between pairs (1,4) to (1,5), then (1,5) to (2,5), and advancing to (3,5). The path then leads from (3,5) to the final destination at (4,5) using the adjacency pairing already established.

This sequential linkage portrays a clear route using the connections from the adjacency list:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path is efficient as it strictly uses given adjacencies to reach the exit point, attempting to minimize backtracking, ensuring we progress towards the maze's end goal. The selection is natural, given the maze constraints and the adjacency connections provided, assuring coverage of all directional options enabled by the maze structure.
