The given adjacency list represents a maze that can be visualized as a graph where each point (node) is a coordinate pair, and each pair is connected to another through a corridor (edge). The goal is to find a path from the start point (origin) to the exit point (target).

By parsing the adjacency list:

- We start at (0,0), which is connected directly to (1,0).
- We then check connections from each accessible point until we reach (4,5).

Following these connections through possible paths and utilizing either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) principles which efficiently allow for exploring all branching paths until finding a destination, here’s a valid path:

1. Begin at (0,0)
2. Next, (1,0) since it's directly connected to (0,0).
3. From (1,0), moving next to (2,0), where there’s also a direct connection.
4. From (2,0), go to (3,0), following the list of connected pairs.
5. From (3,0), move to (2,1), but reconsider as a better route to move from (3,0) to (3,1) then (2,1).
6. From (3,0) proceed to (4,0), keeping along the bottom line of the grid.
7. (4,0) to (4,1) keeps the path forward.
8. From (4,1) to (4,2).
9. (4,2) connects directly to (4,3).
10. Continue to (4,4).
11. Then go from (4,4) to (4,5).

This path finds the exit sequentially without looping back or getting stuck at dead ends, showing direct connections, and maintaining motion predominantly toward the maze's exit.

Thus, the explicit route from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5) following valid connections is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This solution was guided by the clues offered in the adjacency list and the connectivity of each point systematically till the exit was reached, reiterating and checking at every node for the shortest, straightest possible route.
