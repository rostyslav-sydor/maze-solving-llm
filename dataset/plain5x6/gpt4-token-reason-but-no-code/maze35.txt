To solve the maze given in the adjacency list format, we need to identify a path from the start point (0,0) to the target point (4,5). This maze can be visualized as a graph where each node represents a coordinate and each edge denotes a direct path (or passage) between two coordinates. 

The adjacency list has provided all direct connections between neighboring coordinates. We'll use this information to find a pathway from the origin to the target.

The common approach for such problems is to utilize a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this. BFS expands nodes layer by layer from the source, ensuring the shortest path is found due to its level-wise propagation.

Given that our starting position is (0,0) and our target is (4,5), BFS will explore all possible paths efficiently until it reaches the destination or all potential paths are exhausted. This involves:

- Starting at (0,0), considering all accessible direct paths.
- Moving to new nodes (coordinates) and enqueueing them if not already visited.
- Continuously dequeueing nodes from the queue, visiting and marking them as explored, then enqueueing their accessible neighbors that haven't been visited yet.
- This propagation continues until we reach the destination node (4,5) or no nodes remain to explore.

Let's step through this process using the structure of the maze provided. We interpret the adjacency list and apply BFS to track from (0,0) to (4,5). We'll traverse through possible nodes until we find our way to the destination, documenting the nodes in sequence as we proceed.

Given the connections in the adjacency list, the following would be the result of such exploration, representing one of the possible shortest paths from the origin to the target:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

Here:
- Starting at (0,0), we progress rightward to (0,1), continuing across the row until (0,5).
- From (0,5), we take the vertical path until we reach the target at (4,5).
- BFS ensures this path is identified efficiently, and the structure of the adjacency list allows direct access to connected nodes.

Thus, this yields a complete path satisfying the shortest route within the framework of the given maze structure.
