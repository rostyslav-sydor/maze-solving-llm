To solve this maze represented by an adjacency list of nodes, we will look for a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5). The maze is provided as nodes with direct connections, and we aim to find the shortest path leveraging these connections.

I will explain the steps briefly:
1. **Interpreting the Maze**: From the adjacency list given, each pair represents connections (hallways) in the maze, allowing movement between those directly connected nodes.
2. **Choosing a Suitable Method**: For finding the shortest path in a graph, algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) are typically used as they efficiently explore the vertices layer by layer and guarantee the shortest path in an unweighted graph which this maze represents. 
3. **Applying the Algorithm**: By applying BFS:
   - Start at the origin (0,0).
   - Explore all neighbors (adjacent nodes), proceed level by level until the target (4,5) is reached.
   - Keep track of visited nodes and paths using a queue which progressively stores the nodes and their respective paths from the start.
   - When the target node is detected in the exploration process, reconstruct the path from the origin to this node.

**Detailed Path Reconstruction**:
1. **Initialize**: Start at (0,0).
2. **Neighbors Exploration**:
    - First move to (1,0) from (0,0).
    - Next, from (1,0) explore to adjacent (1,1) and proceed to (1,2).
    - From (1,2), move to (1,3), then to (2,3).
    - Continue from (2,3) to (2,4) and then (3,4).
    - From (3,4), move to (4,4).
    - Finally, from (4,4) reach (4,5) which is the target.
   
What makes this sequence the shortest path is the direct connectivity defined in the adjacency list and how BFS explores nodes level by level ensuring the minimum steps taken without revisiting any node.

**Solution of the maze in the required format**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path from the start to the end avoids any cycles and redundancies and efficiently uses the connections provided in the adjacency list to ensure the shortest path in the maze.
