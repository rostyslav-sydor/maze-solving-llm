To solve this maze, we use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Because our maze is an adjacency list of coordinate pairs, this suits the BFS approach perfectly.

Breadth-First Search systematically explores the nodes of the graph layer by layer, ensuring exploration from the source node in the shortest path manner. Starting at the entry point, we can explore all directly connected nodes, record each visited node and its predecessor, and use a queue to track the nodes to visit next.

1. **Starting from Origin**: BFS begins at the starting point (0,0) and looks at each neighboring node, moving in the order that they appear connected in the adjacency list, and ensures that we keep track of nodes that have been visited.

2. **Exploring Neighbors**: For each node we visit, we check all its connected nodes. If they haven't been visited yet, we mark them as visited, record their predecessor (for the path reconstruction later), and add them to the queue for further exploration.

3. **Reaching the Target**: This process continues until we reach the target node (4,5) or exhaust all possible paths. Upon reaching the target node, we can trace back from the target node to the origin using the predecessor records to reconstruct the path.

4. **Reconstructing the Path**: By stepping backwards through the predecessor links from the exit point back to the entry point, we create the sequence of moves that leads from the start to the finish through the maze.

5. **Validity Checks**: It's important to ensure during the traversal that boundaries (if any besides the adjacency connections) or specific conditions (like nodes that cannot be revisited) are respected as per specific maze rules (not clearly specified here but generally part of maze conditions).

Following this reasoning process and stepping through the BFS algorithm for the given adjacency list:

<PATH_START>
(0,0) 
(1,0) 
(2,0) 
(3,0)
(3,1)
(4,1)
(4,2)
(4,3)
(4,4)
(4,5)
<PATH_END>

This path is a valid solution as it connects the `origin (0,0)` to the `target (4,5)` following the connections depicted in the adjacency list, and it represents one of the shortest paths due to the nature of BFS.
