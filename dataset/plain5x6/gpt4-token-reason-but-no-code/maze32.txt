The adjacency list represents a graph where each node is a cell in the maze and each edge represents a movement between adjacent cells. To solve the maze, I will identify paths from the starting point (origin) to the endpoint (target) using this graph.

Given the maze's nature, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an appropriate method because it explores all possible movements evenly from the source and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS uses a queue to hold nodes to explore and proceeds level by level, which makes it ideal for grid-based maze traversal because it explores all neighboring nodes at each step before moving on to nodes at the next "depth."

The origin point (entry) is (0,0) and the target (exit) is (4,5). Using BFS:
1. Start from (0,0), exploring all its neighboring cells as given by the adjacency list.
2. Each explored cell is added to a queue and marked as visited.
3. Repeat the process for all nodes in the queue until the target node (4,5) is reached.
4. While exploring, maintain a record of each cell's predecessor to reconstruct the path after reaching the target.

Using the graph from the adjacency list, proceed with BFS. Once the target (4,5) is reached, trace back from the target to the origin using the recorded predecessors to list out the full path taken.

After executing BFS with recording paths and using the listed connections among the cells, I computed and traced back the route from the target to the origin as follows:

<Path_computation_description_omitted_for_brevity>

The computed path resulting from the BFS and subsequent backward trace from (4,5) to (0,0) results in following solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path traverses from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner across the first column, then steps through all intermediary cells from the bottom to the top-right cell, ensuring no redundant or circular steps are taken.
