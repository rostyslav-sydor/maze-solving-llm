The adjacency list provided represents a maze where each node (a coordinate pair such as (x,y)) is connected to other nodes. These connections can be thought of as paths between cells in a grid-based maze.

For the maze in question:
- The starting point (the 'origin') is at (0,0).
- The goal (the 'target') we aim to reach is at (4,5).

To solve this maze, we can apply a graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores the maze's nodes and checks possible paths until it finds one leading to the target. In typical scenarios, both Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) could be used. BFS is often preferred for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, which is analogous to navigating through a maze where each step to an adjacent node has the same 'cost.' 

The adjacency list confirms that all nodes are connected bidirectionally and no weights need to be considered. Hence, applying BFS starting from the origin (0,0), we would explore each possible path by moving through connected nodes until reaching the target (4,5).

Upon applying BFS while taking note of paths:

Starting from (0,0), we have the options to move to (0,1) and (1,0).
Continuing this exploration efficiently leads us through the nodes connected as pairs:
- From (0,0) to (1,0), and following connected nodes, eventually leading to (4,0) which sequentially connects up to (4,5) through legal movements.
- It must be noted that BFS will ensure all shortest paths are checked from one shell to the next, moving outwards in an expanding sphere concept. By logging the paths and backtracking from the target (4,5) to the origin (0,0), we can reconstruct the route taken.

The correct path traced back from (4,5) to (0,0) by marking predecessor nodes during BFS traversal yields:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path starts from the origin, moves almost directly across horizontal paths, adjusts vertically when necessary, and finishes at the target cell, representing an efficient solution to the maze as modeled by the adjacency list. All nodes and paths used are valid according to the list of connected cells provided, showcasing a complete and systematic exploration adapted to the structured input form.
