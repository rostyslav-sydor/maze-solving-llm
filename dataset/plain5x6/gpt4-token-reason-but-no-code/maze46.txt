To determine a solution path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,5)` in the maze represented in the adjacency list, a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) could be effectively used. However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity in explanation, I will mentally simulate an optimal path-finding algorithm.

The maze can be thought of as a graph where nodes represent points or intersections within the maze, and the edges represent passages between these points.

Starting from the origin `(0,0)`, one would look for neighbors reachable according to the adjacency list and proceed towards the target `(4,5)`. Visiting nodes layer by layer and avoiding nodes that have already been visited, we make progressive steps toward reaching the destination.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list and simulating movement:
1. Starting at `(0,0)`, the next step can be either `(1,0)` or `(0,1)`.
2. Moving towards the right side of the maze where the target is located on the top right corner, we choose `(0,1)`.
3. Subsequent steps proceed to `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, and then `(0,5)`.
4. At `(0,5)`, moving downward follows the nodes `(1,5)`, `(2,5)`, and then `(3,5)`.
5. Finally, move to `(4,5)`, which is the target.

By tracing through the maze using nodes connected directly according to the adjacency list while progressing systematically towards the target, we can deduce the following path:

Therefore, the path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` can be described as:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This method of systematically choosing steps towards the target using adjacent connections allows us to find a straightforward route to the destination.
