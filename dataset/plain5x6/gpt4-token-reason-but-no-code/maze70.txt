The maze is defined in an adjacency list format, noting connectivity between various positions. The goal is to find a path from the starting point (0,0) to the ending point (4,5) using available paths, reiterated in the adjacency list.

By examining the adjacency data, the technique of Breadth-First Search (BFS) is conceptually apt due to its level-order nature which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid or graph scenario. BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time the algorithm reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.

Now analyzing the maze, we initiate BFS from (0,0). Let's trace the edge exploration:

1. Start at (0,0), move to adjacent cells: (0,1).
2. From (0,1), the adjoining cells are (0,0) and (0,2), but since (0,0) is already visited, move to (0,2).
3. Continue from (0,2) onto (0,3) and (1,2); (1,2) expands the new branch towards (1,1) and (1,3).
4. Engaging further, (0,3) moves us to (0,4) and linking back to (1,3).
5. (1,3) steps us deeper via new nodes (2,3).
6. The route through (2,3) guides to (2,2), connecting further to (3,2) and (3,3); both paths opening more unexplored options.
7. The pathway through (3,2) to (3,3) further connects to (3,4) and then unifying with (3,5).
8. At last, from (3,5), reaching the desired goal at (4,5).

Applying BFS across the mazeâ€™s adjacency data ensures the shortest route is found, effectively and efficiently. Thus, we conclude with the solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

Here we see the BFS implementation provides us a path by systematically expanding into reachable nodes until we connect the start to the target through the shortest unimpeded journey, considering all possible traversals within the provided connections.
