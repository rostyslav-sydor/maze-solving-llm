To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we use representations of nodes as coordinates and their connections or edges, indicating passable routes between cells (graph edges between the nodes). Our aim is to find a path from the origin (entry point) to the target (exit point). This can be efficiently tackled using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm due to its nature of exploring neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this.

The maze's representation using adjacency lists usually involves pairs of coordinates that show direct connections between nodes, thus forming the graph's edges. Let's break down the process:

1. **Origin and Target Extraction**: Start at the origin (0,0) and look for a path to reach the target (4,5).

2. **Graph Construction**: Create a graph with nodes representing open/spaces from the adjacency list to track traversable connections.

3. **BFS Algorithm Implementation**: BFS starts at the root node (origin), exploring all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

4. **Trace the Path**: Once the target node is reached, backtrack through the visited nodes to construct the path from the origin to the target.

For the provided adjacency list, visually or programmatically constructing the graph and following the BFS from node (0,0) to (4,5) while keeping track of nodes' parents to reconstruct the path once the target is found, we will end up with the shortest route if no weighted considerations or restrictions are specified.

After thoroughly examining the adjacency relationships and exploring possible routes, we derive the solution based on the BFS outcome. It is critical this approach covers all nodes and reaches the target considering all possible paths, ensuring no shorter path is overlooked.

The specific solution found for the maze with maze entrance at (0,0) and exit at (4,5) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This solution narratively described, begins at the designated start, progresses through each row incrementally, utilizes the direct connections between nodes, and strategically moves to the lower rows and further columns according to the available paths until it reaches the maze exit. This path has been chosen as the efficient route considering the relationships listed in the adjacency list.
