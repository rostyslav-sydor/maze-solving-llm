To solve the given maze in the adjacency list format, identifying paths between the marked origin `(0,0)` and target `(4,5)`, the adjacency graph provides direct connections between coordinates, enabling the tracing of paths from the start to the end point.

The algorithm for traversing such a graph, in this scenario, could be depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is typically preferred for shortest path problems on unweighted graphs, which seems applicable here as thereâ€™s no given weight for the paths between nodes, and the objective might implicitly be to find the shortest path from the origin to the target.

Given our starting point `(0,0)` and the aim of reaching `(4,5)`, the BFS will explore all possible paths from the origin by expanding outward to adjacent nodes layer by layer, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest possible route given the connections. 

To be more specific:
1. Start BFS from `(0,0)`.
2. From each node, explore its adjacent connections as defined by the adjacency list.
3. Track which nodes have been visited to prevent re-processing and possibly looping indefinitely.
4. Continue until you reach `(4,5)`, the target. The nature of BFS ensures that once this node is reached for the first time, it's in the shortest path from the origin.

Let's apply this concept to the maze presented:

1. Begin at the origin `(0,0)`. Its direct connections are to `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, move to its connection `(1,1)`.
3. Then move from `(1,1)` to `(1,2)`.
4. Continue to `(1,3)`, bridging from there to `(2,3)`.
5. From `(2,3)`, `(2,4)` is an available move, followed by `(3,4)`.
6. Move then from `(3,4)` to `(4,4)`.
7. Finally, go from `(4,4)` to `(4,5)`, the target.

This provides one potential path through the maze. Listing the coordinates in sequential order of visits provides the path solution:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This traversal ensures a simple and coherent answer to navigating the maze from the designated origin to the destination using the connectivity outlined in the adjacency list.
