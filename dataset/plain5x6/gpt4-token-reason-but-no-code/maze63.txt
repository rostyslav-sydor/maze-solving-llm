To solve the maze described by the adjacency list provided, the main aim is to find a path from the origin to the target location in the maze. The adjacency list defines all the possible moves from point to point in the maze, essentially the paths where one can walk from one coordinate to another. Each coordinate pair indicates a point in the maze grid, and the pairings show direct connections.

For this problem, a suitable approach involves mapping the adjacency list into a graph data structure and then using a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin to the target coordinate. The commonly used pathfinding algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or Dijkstra's algorithm. For simplicity and efficiency in unweighted graphs like this where each step has the same cost, BFS is often favored. BFS is advantageous in this scenario because it explores all possible moves layer by layer outward from the source until it finds the target, ensuring the shortest path is found due to the unweighted nature of the graph.

We initialize BFS with the origin coordinate (0,0) and seek a path to the target coordinate (4,5). The BFS approach checks each possible move, keeps track of visited nodes to prevent revisiting, and continues until the destination is reached or all possible paths are checked.

Using BFS on the provided graph where each node or vertex in the maze is connected to others as indicated in the adjacency list, we process nodes and explore all connected nodes. If during processing a node we reach our target node (4,5), BFS ensures this happened via the shortest path, and we can then backtrack to produce the list of coordinates for this pathway.

Given the maze design and adjacency list, the BFS would discover the following path when starting at (0,0) and aiming to get to (4,5):

(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (4,1) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5)

This path moves straight down the zeroth column, then moves straight across the 4th row, effectively finding the shortest pathway using direct connections each step of the way according to the listed edges. As BFS checks layer by layer, it will have identified and confirmed this pathway before expanding into further unnecessary explorations, thus ensuring efficiency and optimality. 

The final coordinate path is summarized as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
