To solve the maze presented in the adjacency list format, we first decode the information provided, taking note of the paths between the coordinate pairs, starting point (origin), and endpoint (target). The goal is to find a connecting route from the entry point at (0,0) to the exit point at (4,5).

Upon translating the adjacency list, we can construct a graph in our minds or use descriptive tools. Each pair like (A,B) <--> (C,D) represents a bidirectional path between the coordinates (A,B) and (C,D). Thus, these nodes within the graph are connected.

Using standard graph traversal techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), we can efficiently explore the graph. Starting from the origin point (0,0), we examine neighboring coordinates progressively until we reach the target (4,5). The BFS approach is particularly useful here for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze.

After simulating or calculation, the discovered route from (0,0) to (4,5) would be:

1. Begin at (0,0), explore accessible neighbors: move to (0,1).
2. From (0,1), continue to (0,2).
3. From (0,2), either move back to (0,1) or progress to new reachable nodes, in this case, continue to (0,3).
4. From (0,3), go to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), since multiple paths are possible, move towards the target through available choices - move to (1,2).
6. From (1,2), we have options; we move to (2,2).
7. From (2,2), continue our journey towards the target by going to (3,2).
8. From (3,2) advance to (3,1).
9. From (3,1), move to (4,1).
10. From (4,1), proceed to (4,2).
11. From (4,2), head to (4,3).
12. From (4,3), transition to (4,4).
13. From (4,4), finally traverse to (4,5) which is our target exit point.

Thus, the path sequence from the start to the target is achieved successfully. To conform to the requested format, here is the resulting path outlined:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This output consists of a sequence tracing our steps from the beginning to the end of the maze, verified by the connection rules stated in the original adjacency list, and structured to deliver a feasible solution to exit the maze.
