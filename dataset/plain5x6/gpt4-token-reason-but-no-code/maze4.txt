To solve the provided maze, which is given as an adjacency list, we first translate the information into a graph representation where nodes are the points (coordinates) and edges represent direct passages between these points.

The task is to find a path from the start point (0,0) to the end point (4,5). We'll use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for this purpose. BFS is suited for such problems because it explores the nearest nodes first and guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from the entry point (0,0) with a queue to manage nodes to visit and a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.

2. **Explore Nodes**: For each node, check all its neighbors. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it and add it to the queue. Keep track of each nodeâ€™s parent to reconstruct the path once we reach the exit point (4,5).

3. **Check for Exit**: Each time a node is visited, check if it is the exit. If it is, backtrace through the parent links to reconstruct the path from the start to the exit.

Following this approach for the given graph:

- Begin at (0,0), explore neighbors.
- Move to (1,0) since it's directly connected, then to (2,0) and beyond, checking each neighboring node.
- This exploration continues, layer by layer, until reaching (4,5).

The exploration of the neighbors and maintaining the parent-child relationship as we queue nodes allows us to determine the path once we encounter the target node, (4,5). Tracing back from (4,5) to (0,0) using the recorded parents of each node gives us the shortest maze path.

Upon applying BFS to this graph by following the adjacency node links while keeping track of the visited nodes and their parents, the shortest path to solve the maze from (0,0) to (4,5) is obtained.

Given the structure and connections in the maze description, the shortest path discovered is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
