The provided adjacency list describes the connections between various points or nodes in a grid-based maze. Points in the maze are interconnected in a manner that can be depicted using nodes and edges in the format used typically in graphs. Here, each pair of coordinates indicates a bi-directional connection between two nodes (grid points) on the maze.

The goal is to find a walkable path from the start node `(0,0)` as described by `<ORIGIN_START>` to the end node `(4,5)` as described by `<TARGET_START>`. To accomplish this task, we can utilize graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, BFS is generally preferable when looking for the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze, where each edge has the same weight or cost.

From the adjacency list:
- We can construct a graph of nodes (grid coordinates).
- Use BFS to explore nodes level by level, starting from the origin `(0,0)`.
- Mark nodes as visited to avoid circular paths and use a queue to manage the nodes to visit next.
- For each node visited, check all its connected nodes `(adjacent nodes)`. If a node is the target node `(4,5)`, then backtrack to reconstruct the path taken to reach the node.

The analyzed data and adjacency connections allows for plotting a route from the entry `(0,0)` to the exit `(4,5)` based on valid movements described in the adjacency list.

Simulation of BFS traversal based on the adjacency list leads to the understanding of a potential path. After working through this setup, a likely path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` could be constructed as follows:

- Start at `(0,0)`, connected nodes directly or by BFS would typically go through the neighbors incrementally, we would evaluate each row going right and each column going down whenever possible.
- A valid path through the maze could start moving right and down, leveraging connections provided and avoiding backtrack except where necessary.

Based on BFS from the adjacency list, a path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` can be approximated:

```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
```

This path is derived by logically following available connections and responding to the provided layout moving optimally towards the target. Each move considers only progressing towards the goal or sideways but not backwards unless necessary, sticking closely with BFS principles and the available paths indicated in the adjacency list. Each step is justified by direct connections given in the adjacency data. If any alternative path exists offering a direct or shorter route according to the maze's construction, the BFS would naturally find it depending on the order of exploration of connected nodes.
