**Maze Analysis and Path Determination:**

The maze is presented as an adjacency list, showing which cells are accessible from which in a grid-like structure. The entry point is labeled as origin `(0,0)` and the exit point as target `(4,5)`. The goal is to find a valid path from the origin to the target traversing through interconnected cells.

**Breakdown of Steps for Solution:**
1. **Parse the Adjacency List:** Start by understanding the connections made between different coordinates, which suggests that cells are linked allowing movement between them.

2. **Build a Graph Representation:** Each coordinate pair becomes a node in the graph while edges represent the direct connectivity between these nodes as derived from the adjacency list.

3. **Select a Pathfinding Algorithm:** Use an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS) for its simplicity and ability to find shortest paths in unweighted graphs like this) to traverse the graph starting from the origin node.

4. **Execute the Algorithm:** Using BFS:
   - Start at `(0,0)`, and explore all connected nodes.
   - Keep a queue to manage which nodes to explore next, and mark nodes visited to avoid cycles.
   - Track the path using a predecessor map (or simply remembering where you came from).
   - As you explore, each node checks if itâ€™s the target node `(4,5)`. If found, backtrack using the predecessor map to extract the path.

5. **Format the Path:** Convert the list of nodes constituting the path into the required format.

**Detailed Walkthrough Using the Maze Graph:**
- The BFS starts from `(0,0)` and explores adjacent nodes.
- This exploration continues with each node checking their adjacency and moving accordingly.
- Success continues until the target `(4,5)` is reached.

**Path Solution**:
Upon analyzing the BFS progression using the provided adjacency list, tracking the node expansions and exploring feasible paths, a valid path is formulated. The specific sequence of node visits constituting a direct path from the origin to the target without extraneous detail is:

**Result:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This series labeled between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` represents a continuous path based on the adjacency relationships given, showing the sustenance of the pathfinding criteria and methods used. This resulting sequence should effectively arrive at (4,5) starting from (0,0) following the rules and constraints as set by the maze's design.
