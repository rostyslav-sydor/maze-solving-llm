The given format indicated above is an adjacency list representation of a grid-based maze where each coordinate is a node and each edge represents a direct passage between two adjacent nodes. To solve this maze and find a path from the defined origin (0,0) to the target (4,5), a suitable pathfinding algorithm can be employed. Popular choices for such a problem are Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A* Search, among others. BFS is particularly suited for this task as it effectively finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which matches our scenario since all moves between coordinates cost the same.

Starting from the origin (0,0), BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This approach ensures that once it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest possible route in terms of the number of moves. Given that this adjacency list doesnâ€™t specify any weighted edges and the maze seems to be a standard grid layout without any additional conditions, BFS can optimally solve this maze.

Here, BFS would begin at (0,0), explore its direct connections, mark each as visited, and enqueue them. Then it would progressively dequeue the next node, visit its neighbors, and continue until it reaches (4,5).

Using the BFS on this maze, following the adjacency connections provided, we can map out the exact path needed to traverse from (0,0) to (4,5), keeping track of path nodes through a queue mechanism.

Below is the specific solution derived:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (2,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path moves sequentially from the entry to exit node, utilizing available paths between nodes as specified in the adjacency list. Each move is logical and progresses towards the overall goal of reaching (4,5) while ensuring every step is viable per the given maze connections.
