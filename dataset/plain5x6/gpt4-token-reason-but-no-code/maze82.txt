To solve this maze represented as an adjacency list, we can visualize each coordinate pair as a node in the graph, and each connection between the pairs (indicated by `<-->`) as an edge. The problem is thus transformed into finding a path in the graph from a start node (entry point) to a target node (exit point).

The start node is `(0,0)` and the exit node is `(4,5)`. To solve this problem, we can use path-finding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), which are well-suited for exploring all possible paths in a graph until the exit node is reached.

In this specific case, I manually analyzed the adjacency list and utilized a BFS approach to track the pathways from the start to the end. This approach systematically explores the graph layer-by-layer and would most efficiently find the shortest path (if that was required), although any valid path will suffice for this task. The key is to keep track of visited nodes to avoid loops and to continue expanding the frontier from the most recently discovered nodes.

After analyzing and path-finding within the given adjacency list, the solution came out as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This pathway hops neatly from the start to the exit, moving through accessible adjacencies as decoded from the adjacency list provided, confirming each step connects validly to the next as per the adjacency declarations.
