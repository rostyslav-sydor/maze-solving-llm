To solve the maze provided in the adjacency list, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is effective because it explores the closest nodes first and guarantees to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one presented. 

Given the adjacency list and entry (origin) and exit (target) points, here are the detailed steps to solving this specific maze:

1. **Parsing the Adjacency List:** We convert the adjacency list into a usable graph representation. This graph is a dictionary where each key is a node (coordinate) and the value is a set of nodes that can be directly reached from the key. 

2. **Initialize BFS:** We start BFS from the origin `(0,0)`. We maintain a queue to store the nodes to visit, initialized with the origin node. We also keep a dictionary to track the path, where each key is a node, and the value is the node from which it was reached. This helps in reconstructing the path after reaching the target.

3. **Process Each Node:** 
   - We dequeue the first node and check if it's the target. If it's the target `(4,5)`, we reconstruct the path from the target to the origin using the path dictionary and terminate the search.
   - If it's not the target, we enqueue all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet and mark them as visited. We also record how we reached these adjacent nodes in the path dictionary.

4. **Reconstruct the Path:** Once we reach the target, we use the path dictionary to trace back from the target node to the origin node. This gives us the sequence of nodes that forms the shortest path from the origin to the target in the maze.

5. **Output the Path:** Finally, we format and output the path as a sequence of coordinates between `<PATH_START>` and `<PATH_END>` tokens.

After running BFS on the given maze with the adjacency list and using the mentioned procedure, the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` is found to be:
```
(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5)
```

This sequence of coordinates represents the most direct path found traversing the maze from the entrance at `(0,0)` to the exit at `(4,5)`, bypassing obstacles as dictated by the connections provided in your adjacency list.

Putting it into the required output format, the solution is:
```
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
```
