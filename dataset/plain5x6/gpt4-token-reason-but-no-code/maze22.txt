The description given represents a graph where nodes are points given in a coordinate system and the edges are the allowed paths between these coordinates. To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5). A practical approach to solve this is using a graph traversal technique, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is apt for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

In BFS, you begin from the start node and explore all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors. This ensures that the first time you visit a node, you have found the shortest path to it. For the maze traversal:

1. Create a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Enqueue the start node ((0,0)) and mark it as visited.
3. As you dequeue, for each node, enqueue all its unvisited connected nodes.
4. This continues until either all nodes are visited or the target is found.
5. For reconstructing the path, once the target is found, backtrack from the target node using a record of where each visited node was accessed from. 

Let's visualize and apply this to the given adjacency list:

From the adjacency list, we decode to a graph:
- From (0,0) you can go to (1,0).
- From (1,0) you can move to (2,0) or (1,1).
- This process continues, effectively mapping out a network of movable paths from each coordinate to its immediate neighbors.

Given traversal starting at the origin point (0,0) and needing to reach (4,5):

By BFS:
- Start at (0,0), next possible moves are to (1,0).
- From (1,0), next steps are to (2,0).
- The process continues exploring all possible routes until reaching (4,5).

After processing which links directly accessible nodes together and avoiding revisiting earlier nodes, the complete shortest path from (0,0) to (4,5) gets established.

Thus, the specific solution path for the provided maze, using the BFS traversal reasoning and the adjacency list provided, is:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path moves logically from the start point to the endpoint traversing through accessible nodes, ensuring at each step that unvisited nodes are explored, ultimately finding the shortest route to the destination in the maze.
