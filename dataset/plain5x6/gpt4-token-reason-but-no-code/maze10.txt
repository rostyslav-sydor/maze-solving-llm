The maze is represented as an adjacency list where each pair of coordinates indicates that there is a direct path between these points. To solve it, a common approach involves using a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph such as this one.

**BFS Explanation:**
1. BFS starts at the origin or entry point.
2. It explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
3. It effectively utilizes a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore next.
4. As BFS traverses the graph, it can also record the path taken by storing predecessors of each vertex.
5. Once the destination node is reached, you can backtrack from the target node to the origin node using the predecessor information to reconstruct the path.

**Maze Specifics:**
The origin is (0,0) and the destination is (4,5).

**Using BFS on the Provided Adjacency List:**
1. Start BFS from the origin (0,0).
2. Enqueue (0,0) and initialize it as visited.
3. Dequeue (0,0) and enqueue all unvisited neighbors. According to the adjacency list, its neighbors are: (1,0).
4. Continue this way, exploring each node level by level, until the target node is dequeued.

**Reconstructing the Path:**
If during BFS we maintain a record of where each node came from (its predecessor), then once (4,5) is reached, we can reconstruct the path by tracing backwards from (4,5) to the origin (0,0).

Now let's follow the BFS method on our graph starting from (0,0) till we reach (4,5):

- From (0,0), we can go to (1,0).
- From (1,0), we can go to (2,0).
- From (2,0), we move on to (3,0).
- From (3,0), we can proceed to (4,0).
- Next, from (4,0) to (4,1).
- From (4,1) to (4,2).
- Moving on from (4,2) to.(3,2).
- From (3,2) venture to (3,3).
- From (3,3) to (3,4).
- From (3,4) to (4,4).
- Finally, from (4,4) to (4,5).

**Putting this altogether into the required format:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path follows a straightforward BFS approach, ensuring it is one of the shortest paths from the origin to the destination in the given maze.
