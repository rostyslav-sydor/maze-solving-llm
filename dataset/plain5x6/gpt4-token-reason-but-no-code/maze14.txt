The provided adjacency list describes a graph-based representation of a maze with nodes (cells) connected by edges that allow movement between adjacent cells. The task involves determining a path from the specified origin (0,0) to the target (4,5).

To solve this maze, I will employ a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this. BFS explores the neighbors level by level, which ensures that once it reaches the target, the path found is among the shortest.

Using concepts from BFS and given the adjacency relationships:
1. Begin at the starting point (0,0), marking it as visited.
2. Proceed to explore all connected nodes, marking each as visited and recording the predecessors.
3. Continue this process until the target node (4,5) is reached.
4. Then, backtrack from the target node to the origin using the predecessors to reconstruct the path.

Now, tracing the BFS results from the adjacency list:
- Start at (0,0), directly connect to (1,0).
- Then from (1,0), move to (1,1) followed by (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and finally to (1,5).
- From (1,5), go to (2,5).
- Progress from (2,5) to (3,5).
- Finally, pass from (3,5) to (4,5) which is the target.

After creating the path using the BFS traversal concept on the graph described by the adjacency list, the solved path from the entry point (0,0) to the exit point (4,5) in the maze format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path is efficient, follows the graph's connections, and reaches the goal using traversable links as defined by the given adjacency list.
