To solve the maze described in the adjacency list, we need to identify a route from the starting point (0,0) to the target point (4,5).

**Reasoning**:
1. **Understand the Graph Representation**: The adjacency list given describes how points (or nodes) in the maze are connected. Each pair shows a direct connection between those points, meaning one can move directly between them.

2. **Setting the Problem**: We need to find a path that connects the origin `(0,0)` to the destination `(4,5)` using the available links between nodes.

3. **Finding a Solution**:
   - Start from the origin `(0,0)`, and explore reachable nodes.
   - Using methods like Breadth First Search (BFS) could be ideal because it explores all possible nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - However, for quick reasoning and considering straightforward links:
     - From `(0,0)` consider direct connections and continue to explore until the destination is either reached or all possibilities are exhausted.

**Solution**:
1. Begin at the origin `(0,0)`.
2. Move from `(0,0)` to `(1,0)` based on connections, as it's the only path forward.
3. Navigate from `(1,0)` to `(1,1)` and then to `(1,2)`, following the direct connections.
4. From `(1,2)`, move to `(2,2)` and then to `(2,1)`.
5. From `(2,1)`, move to `(3,1)` which connects to `(3,2)`.
6. From `(3,2)`, explore to `(4,2)` indicating progression towards the target.
7. Continue from `(4,2)` to `(4,3)`, then `(4,4)`.
8. Finally, move from `(4,4)` directly to `(4,5)`, reaching the intended destination.

Thus, a plan based on available paths and probable efficient navigation through the given maze can be laid out.

**Formatted Solution in Requested Format**:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,1) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This solution simply demonstrates potential reasoning based on the graph structure provided and the key connection points, identifying a pathway that sequentially moves the traveler towards the final target.
