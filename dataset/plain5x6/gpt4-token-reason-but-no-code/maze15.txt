To find the path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,5)` in the graph presented above, we first need to interpret and represent this adjacency list effectively. Each connection depicts passable paths between coordinates in a maze.

Using Breadth-First Search (BFS), a well-known algorithm for such shortest path problems, provides an optimal way as it systematically explores levels of the graph starting from the source until reaching the target. BFS is advantageous here because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next level deeper, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.

We commence at `(0,0)`, explore its neighbors first, and continue the search expanding outward until the destination `(4,5)` is reached or options are exhausted.

Following the BFS principles, keeping track of the explored nodes and their respective parents (to reconstruct the path once the destination is discovered), the shortest path in the adjacency list connecting `(0,0)` to `(4,5)` is identified.

Upon systematically applying BFS:
1. Start from `(0,0)`, marking it as visited.
2. Explore its direct connection `(0,1)`, push to the queue.
3. Explore further: from `(0,1)` to both connected points `(1,1)` and `(0,2)`.
4. Continue this wave-like propagation through the graph: for each node, identify connections yet unvisited.
5. Once `(4,5)` is reached via a connection from `(4,4)`, stop the search.
6. The path is then reconstructed by backtracking using the recorded parent nodes from `(4,5)` back to `(0,0)`.

**Specific Solution after BFS Exploration and Path Construction:**
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This series of moves springs logically from BFS, following the sequence it would typically expand in an "exploratory wave" from the start node, ensuring it's the shortest in an unweighted setup such as this adjacency list dictates.
