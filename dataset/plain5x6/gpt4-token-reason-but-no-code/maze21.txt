To solve the maze, the graph needs to be traversed from the origin point (0,0) to the destination point (4,5). A successful method to approach this kind of problem is typically a Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to its optimality and completeness for finding the shortest path in an unweighted maze or graph. BFS works here effectively by exploring all possible moves level by level, ensuring that once we reach the target node, the path given by BFS will be one of the shortest paths available.

This maze's specific adjacency list outlines all the direct connections between points in the maze. By translating this data into a usable format for traversal and applying BFS, we can explore each node starting from the origin and keep track of nodes (coordinates) we have visited to avoid cycling back and forth. This will help in efficiently discovering paths to the destination.

The BFS will process nodes by:
1. Starting at the origin (0,0).
2. Exploring all its directly connected neighbors.
3. For each neighbor, if it hasnâ€™t been visited, we mark it as visited and add it to the queue for further exploration.
4. This continues until we find the destination (4,5) or exhaust all possible paths.

Upon implementing BFS on this graph structure extracted from the provided adjacency list, and following the pathway through the maze using the connections specified, the steps to reach from (0,0) to (4,5) were determined. The step-by-step visitation would optimally lead to a traversal path that reaches the end while obeying the connections described.

In conclusion, following the connections and using BFS as the basis for navigating through the graph, the path found to solve the maze from (0,0) to (4,5) is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path successfully uses the BFS traversal strategy and strictly adheres to the corridors between points indicated in the adjacency list description, achieving a plausible solution to navigate through the specified maze structure in the shortest possible manner based on the available paths.
