The maze provided is represented as a graph, with each node corresponding to a grid point and each edge representing a direct passage between two points. To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the starting coordinate (0,0) to the target coordinate (4,5).

An effective method to solve such pathfinding problems in graphs is the Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores the graph in layers, starting from the source node, and extends outwards to neighboring nodes until the destination is reached. This approach guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one, where each move between connected nodes has the same 'cost' or distance.

We process the adjacency list to create the graph's connections and apply BFS starting from the origin. By storing the path traversed to reach each node, we can reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.

Based on the structure and the connections defined in the adjacency list, I applied BFS to determine the shortest path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5). Considering all possible moves through the provided passages and avoiding cycles with the usage of a visited set, the BFS algorithm successively explores reachable nodes until it finds the target, at which point the traversal path is noted.

Following this approach specifically for the described maze, the path discovered through BFS is as follows:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path is the shortest route from (0,0) to (4,5) according to the maze's rules and connections. Each tuple represents a point in the maze that forms part of the shortest path discovered by BFS analysis.
