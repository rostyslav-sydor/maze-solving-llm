To solve the maze, we start by understanding that the adjacency list describes the connections between each point (coordinate) in the maze. Each connection `(x1, y1) <--> (x2, y2)` means that there is a direct path between these two coordinates.

The goal is to find a path from the origin `(0,0)` to the target `(4,5)`. Using a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable here because BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic of BFS makes it optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze such as this.

Letâ€™s apply BFS starting from `(0,0)`:
1. Initialize the queue with `(0,0)` and mark it visited.
2. Dequeue `(0,0)` and enqueue all its neighbors (while marking them visited). From the adjacency list, the neighbors of `(0,0)` are `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
3. Continue this process, at each step dequeue a node and enqueue its unvisited neighbors.
4. Stop when the target `(4,5)` is dequeued, ensuring this is the shortest path due to BFS properties.

Following through these steps while tracking the path:

1. Start at `(0,0)`, neighbors to explore are `(1,0)` and `(0,1)`.
2. From `(0,1)`, move to `(0,2)` and from `(0,2)`, move to `(0,3)`. Then from `(0,3)`, move to `(0,4)`, and then to `(0,5)`.
3. From `(0,5)`, can move to `(1,5)`. 
4. From `(1,5)`, move to `(2,5)`.
5. From `(2,5)`, move to `(2,4)`. From `(2,4)`, move to `(3,4)`.
6. From `(3,4)`, move to `(3,5)`.
7. Finally, from `(3,5)`, move to `(4,5)`, which is our target.

This sequence of moves represents a valid and potentially shortest path through the maze from the origin to the target.

Here is the path in the required format:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
