From the adjacency list provided, we can interpret that the graph describes a maze-like structure with various nodes (coordinates) and edges between them representing passages. The entry point or origin is given at coordinate (0,0) and the exit or target is at coordinate (4,5).

To solve the maze and find an appropriate path from origin to target, we can follow breadth-first search (BFS). This method will help us explore the maze layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found. Using BFS starting from the origin point (0,0), we'll search and traverse through connected paths until reaching the target point.

The procedure involves:
1. Starting from (0,0), enqueuing this point, and marking it as visited.
2. Gradually exploring all adjacent or connected nodes from each node we dequeue, marking new nodes as visited and keeping track of our path using a predecessor map.
3. Once (4,5) is reached during BFS traversal, we trace back from this point using our predecessor map to extract the path from origin to target.

By applying BFS to the provided adjacency list, tracing connections and paths, we can determine the steps as follows:

From (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5).

Let's summarize this in the required format:
<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

These steps are derived directly by following BFS and represents the shortest route from start to end in the given maze, making use of each connection only once where direct paths are teased out from the adjacency connections given.
