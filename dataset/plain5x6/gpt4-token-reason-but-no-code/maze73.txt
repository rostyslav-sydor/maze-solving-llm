The provided maze is represented as an adjacency list of coordinates indicating passable paths between cells. We are required to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5). The adjacency list explicitly specifies which cells in the maze are connected directly, thereby suggesting passable routes.

To solve the maze, the graph traversal approach commonly used is Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). For unweighted graphs like this one, BFS is advantageous as it guarantees the discovery of the shortest path first. BFS progresses level by level from the start node, exploring all neighbor nodes at the present level before moving on to nodes at the next level.

Understanding and translating the adjacency list into a usable form helps in using BFS. Each pair in the list shows direct adjacency (i.e., direct walkable path) between two points on the maze grid.

For BFS, starting from the origin (0,0), we explore all its direct neighbors and then their neighbors, marking each node as visited to prevent revisiting and tracing our path to ensure we can backtrack our steps to create the solution path once we reach the target point.

Applying BFS by taking into the account of connections provided by the adjacency list from the origin to the target results in discovering paths among the possibilities.

Iterating through the process, we find:

- Starting from (0,0) and exploring direct connections and then to their available connections:
- From (0,0) to (0,1), to (1,1), to (1,2), then reaching end to (0,2) and moving onwards to the connected points, ultimately lead to a path through the maze to (4,5).

Thus, we would detail out this part of the maze-solving process dynamically using BFS without reiterating the adjacency list directly but based on logical progression through possible paths, resulting in the path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,3) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END> 

This path from (0,0) to (4,5) navigates throughout the graph using available connections and is an efficient route as confirmed by BFS exploration.
