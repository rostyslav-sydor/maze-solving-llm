To solve this maze, we'd first parse the adjacency list to understand which cells (coordinates) are connected directly. This representation resembles a graph where each cell corresponds to a vertex and each direct connection between cells corresponds to an edge.

Given the origin (entry) at (0,0) and the target (exit) at (4,5), a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) would be ideal. BFS is well-suited for such tasks as it explores the graph level-by-level, ensuring the shortest path is found when exploring an unweighted graph (where each move from one cell to another can be considered as having equal cost or distance).

In BFS, we would start at the origin and explore all adjacent cells, queuing each unvisited neighbor to ensure all possibilities are explored efficiently. We keep track of visited nodes and the path taken to reach them (usually through some back-pointing mechanism). The moment we reach the target cell, we can trace back our steps to delineate the exact path from the origin.

Given this maze, a specific solution results from applying BFS, which identifies the shortest route (or one of the shortest routes, if multiple exist with the same length) from (0,0) to (4,5). 

After performing the BFS on the parsed adjacency list and marking paths, here is the determined path:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

Here, the path leads from the origin point, maneuvering around the available connected cells (as extracted from the adjacency list), and efficiently reaching the exit without redundant moves. This solution represents an optimal path based strictly on the maze's given structure.
