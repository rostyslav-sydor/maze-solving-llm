To find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5) in this maze, I'll need to interpret the adjacency list to view the maze as a graph where each pair of coordinates represents the nodes connected directly by a path (an edge in graph terms). The adjacency list gives pairs of connected nodes, which means passage is feasible between these coordinates.

**Steps to solve this maze:**
1. First, identify how nodes are connected based on the given adjacency list. This provides a map of possible movements in the maze.
2. Apply a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) for an unweighted maze like this. BFS is ideal because it explores all possible moves at each breadth level, hence finding the shortest path in terms of number of moves (each move is to an adjacent node).
3. From the origin (0,0), explore all connected nodes, then repeat this process for newly discovered nodes until the target is reached, ensuring to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
4. During exploration, maintain a record (e.g., a predecessor list) that tracks from which node each node was reached. This helps to reconstruct the path from the target back to the origin once the target is found.
5. Once the target node (4,5) is found, backtrack using the predecessor list to construct the path from the origin to the target.

**Constructing the Maze's Graph:**
The adjacency list notes connections like:
- (1,1) <--> (0,1)
- (4,2) <--> (4,3)
- (3,2) <--> (4,2)
... (and so on for each listed pair, providing bidirectional movement between connected nodes).

**Executing a BFS from (0,0):**
- Start at (0,0), then move to connected nodes (using the adjacency list).
- Continue until (4,5) is reached.

**BFS Path Discovery (outlined steps):**
- Starting at (0,0), which connects directly to (0,1), explore next.
- From (0,1), access (1,1) and (0,2), explore these next.
- Continue this process, exploring all connections, marking each node as visited to prevent re-exploration, and recording the parent of each node.
- Upon reaching (4,5), backtrack using the parent records from (4,5) to (0,0) to discover the path.

**Reconstructed Path from BFS:**
This maze can result in multiple valid paths due to multiple connections, but BFS will find one of the shortest paths. Given the setup, an example path traversing the maze from (0,0) to (4,5) might look like this:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path represents a possible route derived from exploring nodes level by level, always moving towards the target via accessible neighboring nodes, and selecting one potential shortest path from the origin to the target.
