The provided adjacency list gives us the information about which points in the maze are directly connected. To solve the maze, we will use this information to find a path from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5).

Since the maze pathways are described with an adjacency list, we can interpret the connections as edges in a graph, and the positions marked by coordinates (x, y) as the vertices. 

The challenge is finding a path between the origin and the target in this graph representation of the maze. One effective way to solve this for an unweighted graph (where each step from one vertex to the next has equal cost) is using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores the nearest vertices first and guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted scenario, which is suitable given we seek the shortest route through the maze.

Steps to solve:
1. Start BFS from the origin point (0,0).
2. Explore all direct connections from the current point, marking each as visited and recording the path taken.
3. Continue exploring until the target (4,5) is reached.
4. Trace back the path from the target to the origin using the recorded movements.

Here we manually perform BFS based on the adjacency list to navigate through the maze.

Performing BFS:
- Start at (0,0), potential moves are to (0,1) and (1,0).
- Explore (0,1), from there go to (0,2).
- From (0,2), we can reach (0,3).
- Continuing from (0,3) to (1,3) and then (1,4).
- From (1,4) it is possible to reach (2,4).
- Next from (2,4) we move to (2,5).
- From (2,5) progress to (3,5).
- Finally, from (3,5) to the target (4,5).

By following the BFS search pattern and ensuring paths are connected as per the adjacency list, we find the path from (0,0) to (4,5). Accordingly, the output is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,3) (1,4) (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path is the shortest way from the origin to the target based on the connections specified in the adjacency list.
