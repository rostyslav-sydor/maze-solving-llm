To solve the maze represented as an adjacency list, I need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (4,5). For this task, I'll employ a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is a common approach for finding the shortest path in a graph, where each edge has equal weight, as is the case in an unweighted maze.

1. **Initialize BFS**: Start at the entry point (0,0), mark it as visited, and initialize a queue with this node.
   
2. **Explore Neighbors**: From the current node, explore all adjacent nodes (coordinates connected directly by edges in the adjacency list). These nodes represent steps in the maze where you can travel from one node to another.

3. **Tracking Path**: For each node, keep track of the path leading up to it. This can be managed by associating each visited node with the node from which it was visited.

4. **Checking for Exit**: At each step of BFS, check if the node being visited is the exit point (4,5). If so, reconstruct the path using the information on how each node was visited.

5. **Continuing Search**: If the target hasn't been reached, add its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited. Repeat this process until either the target is reached, or there are no more nodes to explore (indicating no path exists).

After applying BFS to the maze defined by the adjacency list:
- Starting at (0,0)
- Explore every possible path using the edges specified
- Stop when (4,5) is reached

The solution, therefore, tracing back through the visited nodes from (4,5) to (0,0):

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This sequence represents the shortest path from the origin to the target within the maze based on the provided adjacency relations.
