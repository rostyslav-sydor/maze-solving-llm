To find a solution path through the given maze from the origin point (0,0) to the target point (4,5), we begin by constructing the graph from the adjacency list provided. Each tuple represents a coordinate in a grid-like map, and the pairs separated by "<-->" denote that there is a direct path between these two points.

The optimal way to solve a maze represented as a graph is to use a search algorithm, typically Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). These algorithms are suitable because they systematically explore all possible paths. For this case, BFS is particularly well-suited as it finds the shortest path in a maze where each step has equal weight or cost.

Starting BFS from the origin (0,0), we will explore neighboring nodes, then the neighbors of those nodes, and continue until we find the target (4,5). Queue data structure is used in BFS to help in checking nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is identified.

For this specific maze, due to the provided adjacency list, the graph configuration ensures that there are connections between important points which would allow for progressing from the origin to the target.

**Step-by-Step BFS Search**:
1. Begin at (0,0), enqueue.
2. Visit all adjacent nodes to (0,0), which are (1,0) and (0,1), and enqueue them.
3. From (0,1), move to (0,2) which connects furthermore to (0,3) and then to (0,4).
4. Parallelly, from (1,0) move to (2,0) then to (3,0), then to (3,1) and continue through connections towards (3,2), (3,3), and finally reaching area at (3,4) and (3,5).
5. Finally, from (3,5) proceed to the target at (4,5) via connecting nodes.

Considering transitions based on available paths in the adjacency list, we get the solution path from (0,0) to (4,5).

The specific solution will form as part of the path output:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path utilizes the continuous linkage of nodes directly in the pathway from the origin to the target, ensuring we step over every connected corridor in the maze systematically using BFS to navigate through connected direct paths.
