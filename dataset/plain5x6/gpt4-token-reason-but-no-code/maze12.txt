To solve the provided maze, let's first understand the given graph from the adjacency list: 

Each pair `(x, y) <--> (a, b)` represents a bidirectional passage between two nodes or rooms defined by their coordinates. For simplicity, you might imagine each point `(x, y)` on a grid where `x` is the row and `y` is the column.

The adjacency list offers connections between various nodes, effectively outlining all valid moves one may take between connected nodes. It specifies no weighted costs, so we consider each move from one node to the next as equal in cost or distance.

The Origin of the maze is `(0,0)` and the Target is `(4,5)`. The challenge is to find a path from the origin to the target, traversing through valid connections only.

An efficient approach to solve this problem is by using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which explores the maze layer-by-layer or level-by-level starting at the origin. BFS is particularly good for this task due to its nature of exploring the shortest path first in an unweighted graph like our maze.

Here's a step-by-step deduction made to find the solution:

1. **Initialize** BFS with the starting node `(0,0)` and an empty queue.
2. **Enqueue** the starting node and begin exploration.
3. **Dequeue** the next node and check all adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node, check if it has been visited; if not, mark as visited and enqueue.
4. **Repeat** the process continuously until the target `(4,5)` is reached or nodes are exhausted.

Based on exploring the adjacency list and utilizing the BFS method, let's derive the path:

Starting from `(0,0)`, you move to `(0,1)`, then to `(0,2)`, then to `(0,3)` which connects to `(0,4)`. From `(0,4)`, you make a move to `(1,4)`, then to `(1,5)`, and finally you make consecutive moves from `(1,5)` to `(2,5)`, then to `(3,5)`, and finally to `(4,5)`.

This path leads directly from the start `(0,0)` to the target `(4,5)` only using valid connections as per the adjacency list. Hence, the solution to the maze can be presented as:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (1,4) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>
