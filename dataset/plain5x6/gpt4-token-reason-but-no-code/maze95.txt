The maze specified in the problem is represented as a grid with coordinates, and adjacent cells form connections, as mentioned in the adjacency list. The adjacency list contains pairs of connected nodes that represent which cells in the maze can travel to which. The task is to find a path from the entry point `(0,0)` to the exit point `(4,5)`.

Given the details, constructing the maze as a graph where each node represents a cell in the maze and edges denote possible paths between them is the approach to take. The solution involves a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) that is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

The BFS is ideal because it explores neighbors level by level, ensuring that as soon as we discover the target node `(4,5)`, we've found the shortest path due to the uniform edge weight. Additionally, recording the path is straightforward as it involves tracking where each node was reached from.

The BFS algorithm was simulated with the starting node `(0,0)`, exploring each neighboring node and enqueueing it if not previously visited, while marking where each node was visited from. When the exit `(4,5)` is dequeued, the path reconstruction is done by backtracking using the nodes' parent links until reaching the starting point again, thus compiling the path from start to finish.

Here is the solution to navigate through the maze from `(0,0)` to `(4,5)`:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5) <PATH_END>

This path essentially moves through the connections in the graph as reachable from one node to another, ensuring movement through permissible paths only as dictated by the adjacency connections in the maze structure.
