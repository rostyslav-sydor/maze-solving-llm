To solve the maze problem presented, we start by understanding the given adjacency list of maze pathways which show how different points in the maze are connected directly to one another. Essentially, these connections describe a graph where each node is a coordinate on a maze grid and edges between nodes represent direct pathways between these coordinates.

In this context, our task is to find a path from the origin (entry point of the maze) to the target (exit point of the maze). The origin and target are specified as (0,0) and (4,5) respectively.

A practical approach to solve this using the adjacency list would be to represent the maze as a graph and deploy a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). This algorithm is particularly suitable for such tasks as it explores all possible nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thereby effectively finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one described here.

Starting the BFS from the origin:
1. The algorithm begins at the origin node (0,0) and explores all directly connected nodes.
2. It then moves on to the neighbors of these nodes, and this process is repeated until the target node is reached or all possible paths are explored.

Each node maintains information about which node it was reached from, allowing us to reconstruct the shortest path by backtracking from the target to the origin once the target is reached.

Based on the adjacency relations defined, and visualising the backtracing method in cartographical form, the solution path from (0,0) to (4,5) found through BFS backtracking would unfold as follows:

- Start from the origin (0,0).
- To (1,0), as per adjacency between (1,0) and (0,0).
- To (2,0), as there's a connection between (1,0) and (2,0).
- To (3,0), continuing through the connection from (2,0).
- Then to (4,0), by the adjacency from (3,0).
- Move from (4,0) to (4,1).
- Progress to (4,2) by adjacency from (4,1).
- Continue to (4,3).
- Move to (4,4), per the adjacency from (4,3).
- Finally traverse to (4,5), which completes the path due to its connection to (4,4).

By constructing this path using BFS from (0,0) to (4,5), the shortest path chosen by the BFS is determined.

Thus, the maze solution in the correctly specified format is:

<PATH_START> (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) <PATH_END>
